"""THE STAR WARS"""
FADE IN:
1 EXT. SPACE 1
A vast sea of star serves as the backdrop for the MAIN
"TITLE, which is followed by a ROLL UP:"
The REPUBLIC GALACTICA is dead. Ruthless
"trader barons, driven by greed and the"
"lust for power, have replaced enlighten-"
"ment with oppression, and ""rule by the"
"people"" with the FIRST GALACTIC EMPIRE."
"For over a thousand years, generations of"
JEDI KNIGHTS were the guardians of peace
and justice in the galaxy. Now these
legendary warriors are all but extinct.
One by one they have been hunted down and
destroyed by the sinister agents of the
Emperor: the DARK LORDS OF THE SITH.
It is a period of civil wars. Rebel
"Armies, striking from fortresses hidden"
"deep within the Great rift, have won a"
crushing victory over the powerful Imper-
ial Starfleet. The Emperor knows that
one more such defeat will bring a thou-
"sand more solar systems into the rebellion,"
and Imperial control of the Outland systems
could be lost forever. To crush the
"rebellion once and for all, the Emperor"
has sent one of his most ferocious Dark
Lords to find the secret rebel strongholds
and destroy them...
The awesome yellow planet of Utapau emerges from total
"eclipse. A tiny silver spacecraft races into view, fol-"
lowed by a giant Imperial stardestroyer. Hundreds of
deadly laser bolts streak from the Imperial warship as
it dives on the smaller craft. The overwhelming concen-
tration of laser fire causes the main solar fin of the
"rebel craft to disintegrate, creating a spectacular"
heavenly display. The smoldering rebel ship is quickly
overtaken by the giant Imperial warship.
2 INT. REBEL SPACEFIGHTER - MAIN PASSAGEWAY 2
"The chaos of battle echoes through the narrow, main cor-"
ridor of the starfighter.
"An explosion rocks the ship as two construction robots,"
ARTOO DETOO (R2-D2) and SEE THREEPIO (C-3PO) struggle
"to make their way through the shaking, bouncing passage-"
way. Both robots are old and battered. Artoo is a
"short (36 inches), claw-armed, triped. His face is a"
"mass of computer lights, surrounding a radar eye."
"Threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot"
of human proportions. He has a gleaming bronze-like
"metallic surface of an ""Art Deco"" design."
THREEPIO
Did you hear that? They've shut down
the main reactor. We'll be destroyed
for sure. This is madness!
The little dwarf robot makes a series of electronic sounds
that only another robot could understand. Rebel troops
"rush past the robots, and take up positions in the main"
passageway. Everything is suddenly still and quiet.
Tension mounts as the rebels wait for the pending attack.
Loud metallic footsteps are heard moving around on the
outside the hull of the ship. The scraping screams of heavy
equipment being dragged across the metal skin of the star-
ship run chills up Threepio's bronze spine. He huddles in
a small alcove with little Artoo watching the passageway
ceiling.
THREEPIO
There is no escape for the Captain
this time...
A tremendous blast opens up a hole six feet wide in the
side of the main passageway and a score of fearsome storm-
"troopers, armed with powerful multi-laser rifles, make"
their way into the smoking corridor. The rebel warriors
"draw their chrome, laser pistols, and blast out several"
shots that rip through the Imperial stormtroopers.
"In a few moments, the entire passageway blazes with laser"
"fire. The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns,"
creating small explosions. Stormtroopers scatter and duck
behind storage lockers. Laser bolts hit several storm-
"troopers who scream and stagger through the smoke, holding"
shattered arms and faces.
"In the confusion, Artoo and Threepio are blown slipping"
"and sliding into a power canister, but rushing gas from a"
broken pipe keeps knocking them over. The lanky Threepio
"becomes entangled in the mass of dangling wires, which"
spark and pop every time he attempts to move. Artoo clings
to a pipe for dear life.
THREEPIO
Help me! I think something is
melting... This is all your fault!
I should have known better than to
trust the logic of a half-sized
thermocapsulary dehousing-assister...
Artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as he struggles to
free the larger robot. The battle rages around the two
"hapless robots. Suddenly, there is a slight lull in the"
"fighting, then a deathly quiet sweeps over the passageway"
"as an awesome, seven-foot tall DARK LORD OF THE SITH makes"
his way into the blinding light of the main passageway.
"This is DARTH VADER, right hand of the Emperor. His face"
is obscured by his flowing black robes and grotesque
breath mask which stands out next to the fascist white
armored suits of the Imperial stormtroopers. Everyone
instinctively backs away from the imposing warrior.
"Vader raises his arms and objects that aren't bolted down,"
"including the rebel warriors, are picked up by an invisi-"
ble force and hurled to the end of the passageway. In
"the excitement, Artoo and Threepio have fled down a"
sub-hallway.
3 EXT. UTAPAU - DESERT WASTELAND - DAY 3
A death white wasteland stretches from horizon to hori-
zon. The tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settles
"on a lone figure, LUKE STARKILLER, a farm-boy with"
heroic aspirations; who looks much younger than his
twenty years. His short hair and baggy tunic give him
"the air of a simple-minded, but lovable lout with a"
prize-winning smile. His face is partially covered by
a breath mask and goggles.
A light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves
"on a large chrome pipe, which sticks out of the desert"
floor much like and oil-rig christmas tree. He is aided
"by a small, very beat-up tread-robot with six claw arms."
"The little robot appears to be barely functioning, and"
moves with jerky motions. A bright sparkle in the morn-
"ing sky catches Luke's eye, and he instinctively grabs a"
pair of electrobinoculars from his utility belt.
LUKE
Holy maker.
"He stands transfixed for a few moments, studying the"
"heavens, then dashes toward his dented, crudely repaired"
Landspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few
feet above the ground on a magnetic field).
"He motions to the tiny robot, who is scooting around in"
"a tight circle, to follow him."
LUKE
Hurry up! Come with me.
The robot stops short and smoke begins to pour out of
every joint. Luke throws up his arms in disgust.
LUKE
"Great, just great!"
"He gives the dwarf robot a swift kick in the side, which"
doesn't seem to make much difference. The young farm boy
rushes to his landspeeder and zooms off leaving the
smoldering robot to hum madly.
4 INT. REBEL SPACEFIGHTER - SUB-HALLWAY 4
A series of explosions echo throughout the ship as the
"tall, gleaming Threepio rushes through the narrow sub-"
"hallway yelling at Artoo, who is racing along on a small"
set of wheels under his center foot.
THREEPIO
They're heading in this direction!
We'll be sent to the spice mines of
KESSEL or smashed into who-knows-
what!
Artoo stops before the small hatch of an emergency life-
pod. He snaps the seal on the main latch and a red
"warning light begins to flash. The stubby, dwarf-robot"
works his way into the cramped four-man pod.
THREEPIO
Hey! You're not permitted in there.
It's restricted. You'll be
deactivated for sure. Now come out
before someone sees you. Come on!
Artoo whistles something at his reluctant friend.
THREEPIO
I'm not getting in there. No more
adventures. It's too dangerous. I'm
not that desperate.
Artoo isn't happy with Threepio's stubbornness and he beeps
and twangs angrily.
THREEPIO
"Don't call me a mindless philosopher,"
you overweight glob of grease...
"A new explosion, this time very close, sends dust and"
debris through the narrow sub-hallway. Flames lick at
"Threepio, and after a flurry of electronic swearing from"
"Artoo, the lanky robot jumps into the lifepod."
THREEPIO
I'm going to regret this.
"The safety door snaps shut, and with the thunder of ex-"
"ploding latches, the tiny lifepod ejects from the dis-"
abled starfighter.
5 INT. IMPERIAL STARDESTROYER - COCKPIT 5
"On the main viewscreen, the lifepod carrying the two ter-"
rified robots speeds away from the stricken rebel space-
craft.
CHIEF PILOT
There goes another one.
CAPTAIN
Hold you fire. No life forms.
It must have short-circuited. Don't
waste your power...
6 INT. REBEL SPACEFIGHTER - COCKPIT CORRIDOR 6
"Darth Vader, the black knight, takes a short restraining"
pole from one of the guards and brutally jabs a captured
rebel officer in the chest.
VADER
Where is she? Where is it?
The rebel cries out as the spooky looking Sith Lord be-
"gins to twist his arm, creating a gruesome snapping and"
popping of broken bones.
7 EXT. SKY OVER UTAPAU - LIFEPOD 7
The reddish-yellow mass of Utapau seems to engulf the
tiny lifepod containing the two robots. The grouping
of starships grows smaller as the pod descends toward
the planet.
THREEPIO
That's funny. the damage doesn't
look as bad from out here. Are you
sure this thing is safe?
8 EXT. ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION - DAY 8
"A small settlement, consisting of a few rundown block-"
"house type buildings, rests against one of the huge rock"
mesas. Heat waves radiate from the dozen or so bleached
white buildings. Luke pilots his landspeeder through
"the dusty, empty street of the tiny settlement. An old"
"WOMAN runs to get out of the way of the speeding vehicle,"
shaking her fist at Luke as he flies past.
WOMAN
I've told you kids to slow down!
Luke pulls up behind a low concrete service station that
is all but covered by the shifting desert sands. The
rusted hulk of a landspeeder lies half-buried to one side
of the building. Luke jumps out of the speeder and runs
into the dilapidated power station.
9 INT. POWER STATION - DAY 9
A dismantled speeder rests in the repair bay of the sta-
"tion. Inside the station's ""office"" sits THE FIXER,"
"rugged-looking, about thirty years old, with a big mous-"
"tache. On his lap sits CAMIE, a sexy, disheveled girl"
about eighteen. Her cloak is pulled up and one of the
Chief's hands rests on her beautiful thigh. They are
both sound asleep. In a small room behind the office
"DEAK and WINDY, two tough boys about the same age as"
"Luke, are playing a computer pool-like game with BIGGS,"
"a tall, handsome startrooper cadet. His flashy uniform"
is a sharp contrast to the loose-fitting tunic of farm
boys. A robot repairs some equipment in the background.
"Luke bounces in yelling excitedly, waking The Fixer and"
"Camie. The others come in from the other room, and"
"Camie jumps off The Fixer's lap, pulling her dress down"
in a sexy manner. Luke is surprised at the appearance
of Biggs.
LUKE
"Biggs, you're back! You graduated"
"from the academy, you're in the"
Starforce.
Biggs has an air of cool that seems slightly phony.
BIGGS
"Of course, where you been kid?"
LUKE
You look great! The uniform and
everything!
Biggs snaps to attention.
BIGGS
"Startrooper Biggs Darklighter,"
guardian of the Bendu. At your
service...
The dazzling spectacle of his uniformed friend is almost
too much for Luke. His eyes glaze over. Suddenly he
snaps out of it.
LUKE
I almost forgot. There's a battle
going on! Right here in our system.
Come and look!
10 EXT. ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION - DAY 10
The group stumbles out into the stifling desert sun.
"Deak and The Fixer complain, and are forced to shade"
"their eyes. Luke has his binoculars out, scanning the"
heavens.
LUKE
There they are!
"Biggs takes the binoculars from Luke, as the others"
strain to see something with the naked eye. Through
the binoculars Biggs sees two small silver specks.
BIGGS
"That's no battle, kid... They're just"
sitting there!
LUKE
But there was a lot of firing earlier...
"Camie grabs the binoculars away from Biggs, banging them"
against the building in the process. Luke reaches for
them.
LUKE
"Hey, easy with those..."
CAMIE
"Don't worry about it, Wormie."
"Fixer gives Luke a hard look, and the young farm boy"
shrugs his shoulders in resignation.
BIGGS
"You're dreaming, kid. I don't think"
the Empire wants to control this
"system. Believe me, this place is"
a big hunk of nothing...
"Luke agrees, although it's obvious he isn't sure why."
"The group stumbles back into the power station, grumb-"
"ling about Luke's ineptitude,"
11 INT. REBEL SPACEFIGHTER - NARROW SUB-HALLWAY 11
A beautiful young girl about sixteen years old huddles
in a small alcove as the stormtroopers search through
"the ship. She is LEIA ORGANA, a rebel princess. The"
fear in her eyes slowly gives way to anger as the muted
crushing sounds of the approaching stormtroopers grows
louder. She steps from her hiding place and blasts two
"troopers with her laser pistol, but she is greatly out-"
numbered and quickly captured.
12-13 INT. REBEL SPACEFIGHTER - HALLWAY - CABIN 12-13
Princess Leia is led down a low-ceilinged hallway by a
squad of armored stormtroopers. Her hands are bound
"with brass bracelets, and she is brutally shoved when"
she is unable to keep up with the briskly marching
troops. They enter a small gloomy chamber where Darth
"Vader, the Dark Lord of the Sith, is sitting. Vader"
speaks in an oddly filtered voice through his complex
breathing mask.
VADER
Did you find anything?
OFFICER
"Nothing, sir."
VADER
It must be on board somewhere. Destroy
the ship and everything on it.
OFFICER
What if they sent a signal?
VADER
We would have picked it up... Nothing
got through... It's on the ship.
The Officer bows and leaves the chamber.
LEIA
I'm a member of the senate. You can't
hold me... Organa Major is a neutral...
"Vader raises his arm and as a sudden pain grips Leia,"
she doubles up unable to continue. Vader raises his arm
and a flask on the table mysteriously jumps into his
open hand. He casually drinks from the flask.
VADER
Enough! I already know about the
"data you've intercepted, but its'"
too late. Whatever information you've
gathered will be destroyed... You will
come to know such suffering as only
the Master of the Bogan Force can
provide...
LEIA
You'll get no information from me.
You have no authority... the council
can't hold me!
VADER
It appears your ship had an accident.
I will see to it that your death is
duely reported. There will be no one
to save you this time.
His frightening laugh rings throughout the ship.
14 EXT. UTAPAU - EDGE OF THE DUNE SEA 14
"JUNDLAND, or ""No Man's Land,"" where the rugged desert"
mesas meet the foreboding dune sea. The two helpless
astro-robots kick up clouds of dust as they leave the
lifepod and clumsily work their way across the desert
coastline.
THREEPIO
What a forsaken place this is.
We seem to be made to suffer. It's
our lot in life. I've got to rest
before I fall apart. My joints are
almost frozen.
Suddenly Artoo makes a sharp right turn and starts off
in the direction of the rocky desert mesas. Threepio
stops and yells at him.
THREEPIO
Where do you think you're going?!?
A stream of electronic noises pour forth from the small
robot.
THREEPIO
"Well, I'm not going that way. It's"
too rocky. This way is much easier.
What makes you think there are
settlements that way?
Artoo counters with a long whistle.
THREEPIO
Don't get technical with me. I've
had just about enough of you. Go
"that way, go on! You'll be"
"malfunctioning within a day, you"
near-sighted scrap pile!
He shoves Artoo and the tiny robot tumbles down a small
dune. Threepio starts off in the direction of the vast
dune sea as little Artoo struggles to his feet and shakes
a metallic claw at his ex-partner.
THREEPIO
... and don't let me catch you
"following me, begging for help..."
because you won't get it!
Artoo's reply is a rather rude sound. He turns and
trudges off in the direction of the towering mesas.
15 EXT. UTAPAU - DUNE SEA 15
"Threepio, hot tired, struggles up over the ridge of"
"a dune, only to find more dunes, which seems to go on"
for endless miles. He looks back in the direction of
the now distant rock mesas.
THREEPIO
You little malfunctioning twerp.
This is all your fault. You tricked
"me into going this way, but you'll do"
no better.
"He sits in a huff of anger and frustration, knocking the"
"sand from his joints. His plight seems hopeless, when"
a glint of reflected light in the distance reveals an
object moving toward him. The bronze android waves
frantically and yells at the approaching transport.
16 INT. POWER STATION - DAY 16
Luke and Biggs are sitting in a corner of the now empty
power station. Biggs has had a little too much to drink
and sloppily leans close to Luke.
BIGGS
"I'll tell you, Luke, and this is"
between you and me. The star force
isn't all it's cracked up to be.
"Frankly, it's a bore, and it's going"
to stay that way as long as this
system is neutral...
LUKE
But you always said things were so
great at the academy... What happened?
BIGGS
"The academy is fantastic... Of course,"
they won't teach you anything about
flying you don't already know. Most
of the instructors are very conservative
pilots. You can fly circles around
them... but there is a lot on the
scientific side that is down-right
"amazing, and you get a lot of"
"discipline... but after you graduate,"
don't join the star force -- go
free-lance. It's the only way to get
into the action... I can't wait until
my hitch is up.
LUKE
At least you're doing something... I'd
give anything to be in your position.
BIGGS
"Just be warned, that things aren't"
always as they seem... especially the
starforce recruiting posters.
They quietly sit in the dim coolness of the station hav-
ing run out of things to say. Luke finishes his drink
and stands up.
LUKE
It's getting late. I've got to get
back or my uncle's going to kill me.
17 EXT. UTAPAU - ROCK CANYON 17
The gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strange
"foreboding mist, and the ominous sounds of unearthly"
creatures fill the air. Artoo moves cautiously through
"the creepy rock canyon, inadvertently making a loud"
"clicking noise as he goes. He hears a distant, hard"
metallic sound and stops for a moment. Convinced he is
"alone, he continues on his way."
"In the distance, a pebble tumbles down the steep canyon"
"wall and a small, dark figure darts into the shadows. A"
little further up the canyon a slight flicker of light
"reveals a pair of eyes in the dark recesses, only a few"
feet from the narrow path.
The unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail
"until suddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray"
shoots out of the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow.
He manages one short electronic squeak before he topples
over onto his back. His bright computer lights flicker
"off, then on, then off again. Out of the rocks scurry"
"three MEN, no taller than Artoo. They holster strange"
and complex weapons as they cautiously approach the
"robot. They wear grubby cloaks, and their faces are"
shrouded so that only their yellow eyes can be seen.
They hiss and make odd guttural sounds as they heave the
heavy robot to their shoulders and carry him off down the
trail.
18 EXT. UTAPAU - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET 18
"The eight dwarves, or JAWAS as they're sometimes called,"
carry Artoo out of the canyon to a huge tank-like vehicle
the size of a two-story house. They place the robot under
"a large tube on the side of the vehicle, and the little"
robot is sucked into the giant machine.
The filthy little Jawas scurry like rats up small lad-
ders and enter the main cabin of the behemoth transport.
19 INT. SAND CRAWLER - HOLD AREA 19
It is dim inside the hold area of the sand crawler.
Artoo switches on a small floodlight on his forehead and
stumbles around the scrap heap. The narrow beam swings
across rusty metal rocket parts and an array of gro-
tesquely twisted and maimed astro-robots. He lets out a
pathetic electronic whimper and stumbles off toward what
appears to be a door at the end of the chamber.
20 INT. SAND CRAWLER - PRISON AREA 20
Artoo enters a wide room with a four-foot ceiling. In
the middle of the scrap heap sit a dozen or so robots
of various shapes and sizes. Some are engaged in elec-
"tronic conversation, while others simply mill about."
A voice of recognition calls out from the gloom.
THREEPIO
Artoo Detoo! It's you!
A battered Threepio scrambles up to Artoo and embraces
him.
21 EXT. UTAPAU - ROCK CANYON - SAND CRAWLER - SUNSET 21
The enormous sand crawler lumbers off toward the mag-
"nificent twin suns, which are slowly setting over a"
distant mountain ridge.
22-23 INT. ALDERAAN - PRISON CORRIDOR AND CELL 22-23
Two stormtroopers open an electronic cell door and allow
a group of Imperial guards to enter. Princess Leia's
"face is filled with defiance, which slowly gives way to"
fear as Darth Vader enters with a giant black torture
robot.
VADER
Now you will tell me what you did
with the data you gathered. Even
if that information should find its
"way to Mouff Tarkin's legions, it"
will do them no good. Your plight
is truly hopeless.
Leia stares at the evil lord with determination.
VADER
(continuing)
You will tell me the location of
"your hidden bases, and you will tell"
me what happened to the data you stole.
The door slides shut. The long cell block hallway
appears peaceful with armored stormtroopers marching
back and forth. The muffled sounds of the princess'
screaming are barely heard.
24 EXT. SAND CRAWLER - DESERT WASTELAND - DAY 24
A harsh gale blows across the bleak gray surface of the
endless desert wasteland. The morning sky presses down
on the huge sand crawler as it slowly climbs one of the
"massive sand dunes, then disappears down the other side."
25 INT. SAND CRAWLER - PRISON AREA 25
Threepio and Artoo noisily bounce along inside the
cramped prison chamber. Artoo appears to be shut off.
THREEPIO
Will this never end?
Suddenly the trembling and bouncing of the sand crawler
"stops, creating quite a commotion among the mechanical"
"men. Threepio shakes Artoo, and his computer lights"
pop on.
THREEPIO
Wake up! Wake up! We've stopped!!
We're doomed! This is the end... Do
you think they'll melt us down?
"At the far end of the long chamber a hatch opens, filling"
the chamber with blinding white light. A dozen or so
Jawas make their way through the odd assortment of
"robots, placing a small chrome ring to the wrists of the"
ones they select. Artoo and Threepio are among the
"chosen, and are herded outside with several other"
unfortunates.
26 EXT. UTAPAU - LAR'S HOMESTEAD - AFTERNOON 26
"Five battered robots, including Artoo and Threepio, are"
"lined up in front of the enormous sand crawler, which"
is parked beside a small homestead consisting of three
rundown block houses.
"The Jawas scurry around fussing over the robots,"
"straightening them up, or brushing some dust from a"
dented metallic elbow. The shrouded little creatures
"smell horribly, attracting small insects to the dark"
areas where their mouths and nostrils should be.
Out of the shadows of a dingy side-building limps OWEN
"LARS, a large burly man in his mid-fifties. His reddish"
eyes are sunken in a dust-covered face. As the weather-
"beaten farmer carefully inspects each of the robots, he"
"is closely followed by his slump-shouldered nephew, Luke"
Starkiller. One of the vile little Jawas walks ahead
of the farmer spouting an animated sales pitch in a
queer unintelligible language.
"Owen picks out a small astro-robot similar to Artoo, and"
it waddles along behind the group. The limping farmer
stops in front of Threepio and studies him carefully.
OWEN
Do you speak 'Bocce'?
THREEPIO
"Yes, sir, I'm See Threepio, Human-"
Cyborg relations. I have a full T-6
"capacity, and..."
OWEN
"That's enough. Luke, take them to"
the garage and I want you to have
both of them cleaned up by dinner.
As the Jawas start to lead the three remaining robots
"back into the sand crawler, Artoo lets out a pathetic"
"little beep and starts after his old friend Threepio,"
"but is restrained by a slimy little Jawa, who zaps him"
with a little control box. Owen is negotiating with the
"head Jawa, when Luke notices something on the R-2 unit."
LUKE
"Uncle Owen, this R-2 unit has a bad"
"motivator, look!"
He lifts the R-2 unit's claw arm and it drops lifelessly
to the robot's side. Owen argues with the Jawas for a
few moments; then with a little reluctance the scruffy
dwarf trades the damaged astro-robot for Artoo Detoo.
Owen pays off the whining Jawa as Luke and the two
robots trudge off toward a grimy and decaying building
on the far side of the homestead. Several large rodents
scatter as they pass.
27 INT. LAR'S HOMESTEAD - GARAGE AREA - LATE AFTERNOON 27
"The garage is cluttered and worn, but a friendly, peace-"
ful atmosphere permeates the low gray chamber. In the
center of the room Threepio lowers himself into a large
"tub filled with warm oil. Near the battered ""land-"
"speeder"" little Artoo rests on a large battery with a"
cord attached to his face.
THREEPIO
Thanks the maker! This is going to
feel sooo good. I've got such a bad
"case of dust contamination, I can"
barely move.
Artoo beeps a muffled reply. Luke is slouched in the
"corner with his feet up on a bench, watching a magazine"
sized TV set. A woman's voice calls out from the other
room.
BERU
Luke!
"Luke jumps to his feet, turns off the TV set and starts"
dusting little Artoo with an oily rag.
LUKE
"Yes, Aunt Beru... I'm in here."
BERU
Come to dinner.
Luke drops the rag and dashes out of the garage.
28 INT. LAR'S HOMESTEAD - LIVING AREA - LATE AFTERNOON 28
Luke and his uncle Owen sit before a table covered with
"steaming bowls of food. AUNT BERU, a plump, gray-"
"haired matron, carries in a pitcher of blue milk. Luke"
"is in a good mood, and gobbles down his food."
LUKE
"Well, I'm sure glad we finally"
bought those extra 'droids.' I'm
sending my application to the
academy first thing in the morning.
Luke's Uncle Owen has a scowl on his face and appears
to be in a very grumpy mood.
OWEN
First thing tomorrow morning you're
going to check those condensing units
on the south ridge.
LUKE
"I will, but I'll have enough time"
to transmit my application first.
OWEN
You'll check the condensing unit
first... and you're not going to bed
until those 'droids' are completely
cleaned up...
LUKE
But you promised! I've saved enough
money and now you have the extra help
... you promised!
OWEN
I said we'd see.
(pauses for a
moment)
"And as it is, I was forced to borrow"
your academy savings to buy the new
'droids.' When you've saved it up
"again, I'll let you go."
LUKE
You used my savings! You stole my
savings. If my father were here...
OWEN
Your father's dead. Don't ever forget
"who's taking care of you, giving you"
"food, giving you shelter, and giving"
you the allowance in the first place.
If you plan to work at the academy the
"way you work around here, you won't"
last very long. I don't want another
"word. Finish your dinner, then finish"
cleaning those 'droids.'
Luke pushes his half-eaten plate of food aside and rushes
out of the room. Owen mechanically finishes his dinner
afraid to look at his quietly sympathetic wife.
BERU
"Owen, you know it means so much to"
him. Couldn't you have been a little
easier with him?
OWEN
The academy won't treat him any
differently. If he's going to
"become a cadet, he'll have to get used"
to it.
29 EXT. UTAPAU - LAR'S HOMESTEAD - GARAGE AREA - DUSK 29
The giant twin suns of Utapau slowly disappear behind
a distant dune range. Luke stands watching them for a
"few moments, then reluctantly enters the dimly lit"
garage.
30 INT. LAR'S HOMESTEAD - GARAGE AREA - DUSK 30
Threepio is wiping the oil from his glistening bronze
body and little Artoo is still plugged into the power
unit. Luke is very angry and slams a wrench across the
workbench.
LUKE
It just isn't fair!
Threepio timidly approaches the fuming youth.
THREEPIO
"I beg your pardon, sir, but you appear"
to be quite distraught. Is there
anything I might do to help?
Luke glances at the battered robot and a bit of his anger
drains and a tiny smile creeps across his face.
LUKE
Not unless you could get me into the
military academy at Anchorhead.
THREEPIO
"I'm sorry, sir, I'm only a 'droid,'"
and not very knowledgeable of such
things... not on this system anyway.
"As a matter of fact, I'm not even"
sure which system we're on.
LUKE
That's all right. There is nothing
anyone can do about it. You can
call me Luke.
THREEPIO
"Thank you, sir. I'm See Threepio,"
"Human Cyborg relations, and this is"
"my counterpart, Artoo Detoo."
Luke unplugs Artoo and begins to scrape several connectors
on the robot's head with a chrome pick. Threepio con-
tinues to dry himself.
LUKE
There's a lot of carbon scoring here.
It looks like you boys have seen a
lot of action...
THREEPIO
"Indeed, sir, sometimes I'm amazed"
"we're in as good shape as we are,"
what with the rebellion and all...
Luke sparks to life at the mention of rebellion.
LUKE
You've been in the Counter Wars?...
Against the Empire?
THREEPIO
That's how we came to be in your
"service, if you take my meaning..."
LUKE
Tell me where you've been. I am
going to become a startrooper and
fight in the wars. My father was a
Jedi! Were you in many battles?
THREEPIO
"Several, I think. There is not much"
to tell. I'm not much more than an
"interpreter, and not very good at"
"telling stories, not at making them"
interesting anyway...
Luke struggles to remove a small metal fragment from
Artoo's neck joint. He uses a larger pick.
LUKE
"Well, my little friend, you've got"
something jammed in here real good...
Were you on a star-cruiser or a...
"The fragment breaks loose with a snap, sending Luke tumb-"
ling head over heels. He sits up and sees a small (15
"inch) 3-D hologram of Leia Organa, the rebel princess,"
being projected from the face of little Artoo. The image
is a rainbow of colors as it flickers and jiggles in the
dimly lit garage. Luke's mouth hangs open in awe.
LEIA
"Whoever finds this message, I beg you"
see this R-2 unit delivered safely to
the authorities on Organa Major.
It is of the most vital importance
to all free systems. I guarantee in
the name of the United Assembly that
you will be richly rewarded for your
"efforts... My Commanders, use fix"
"Arra Code... X loc tan too nine, I am"
lost. The Sith Lord will surely take
me to Alderaan. You must continue
alone...
"There is a little static, then the transmission is cut"
"short. A grave concern sweeps over Luke, and he runs"
out of the garage.
LUKE
Uncle Owen! Aunt Beru!
31 INT. LAR'S HOMESTEAD - KITCHEN AREA - NIGHT 31
"Now that night has fallen, the interior of the home-"
stead is filled with a warm glow. Luke rushes in as
his Aunt Beru is putting the last of the dinner plates
away.
LUKE
Aunt Beru!
BERU
"What is is, dear?"
Luke is out of breath and takes a few moments to compose
himself. A realization crosses his mind and he suddenly
seems much calmer.
LUKE
Ahh... I... I'm finished with the
droids and I wondered if I could...
ahhh... work on my speeder before I
turn in...
BERU
I'm sure that would be all right.
"But not too late, dear."
Luke gives his aunt a big hug. He seems suddenly very
sentimental and serious.
LUKE
"I love you, Aunt Beru. I really do."
He gives her a little kiss on the cheek and leaves.
BERU
(to herself)
Now what's gotten into that boy?
32 EXT. UTAPAU - LAR'S HOMESTEAD - COURTYARD - MORNING 32
"Morning slowly creeps into the sparse, but sparkling"
oasis of the open courtyard. The idyll is broken by the
"yelling of Uncle Owen, his voice echoing throughout the"
building.
OWEN
Luke! Luke! Where could he be
loafing now?
"Owen enters the courtyard in a huff, scattering the large"
gopher-like rodents. He opens the garage and notices the
battered old landspeeder id missing.
OWEN
Beru! Come here!
33 INT. LAR'S HOMESTEAD - GARAGE AREA - MORNING 33
Owen enters the garage and looks around. He picks up
a magazine-like video slate sitting propped up on the
"bench. It generates a soft glow, as if it had been left"
"on ""hold."" Beru hurries into the garage."
BERU
What is it?
"As Owen picks up the video-slate, it turns itself on and"
Luke's image appears.
LUKE
"Aunt Beru, Uncle Owen, I don't mean"
to hurt you and I know you've been
"good to me, but I'm leaving. There"
are important things I must do. I've
taken my speeder and the 'droids' which
you bought with my savings. I've also
taken my father's lightsaber. You can
keep everything else. I am grateful
"for all you've done. I'll miss you,"
Aunt Beru. I love you both...
The image fades and the old couple stare at one another.
Beru's face is filled with a great loos. Finally she
"turns and leaves the garage, and Owen in disbelief."
OWEN
That boy is going to get himself
killed... He's just like his father.
34 INT. LUKE'S SPEEDER - DESERT WASTELAND (TRAVELING) - DAY 34
The rock and sand of the desert floor are a blur as
Threepio pilots the sleek landspeeder gracefully across
the vast wasteland. Luke rides precariously on the back
trunk of the vehicle adjusting something in the motor
compartment.
LUKE
(yelling)
How's that?
"Threepio signals that it is fine, and Luke climbs back"
into the wind-whipped cockpit and slides the canopy shut.
LUKE
I've never been this far beyond the
dune sea before. Biggs said the wild
"things out here were weird and savage,"
but it doesn't look like there is much
out here to me. I think we should
be there soon. General Kenobi was my
"father's commander, and he is probably"
the greatest of all the Jedi knights...
or at least my father thought so. He
will certainly know what to do.
35 EXT. UTAPAU - ROCK MESA - DUNE SEA - COASTLINE - DAY 35
"From high on a rock mesa, the tiny landspeeder can be"
seen gliding across the desert floor. Suddenly in the
"foreground two weather-beaten Tusken Raiders, shrouded in"
"their grimy desert cloaks, peer over the edge of the"
rock mesa. One of the marginally human creatures raises
"a long ominous laser-rifle, and points it at the speeder,"
but the second creature grabs the gun before it can be
fired.
The Tusken Raiders speak in a coarse barbaric language
as they begin to get into an animated argument.
The second Tusken seems to get in the final word and
the nomads scurry over the rocky terrain to where two
large BANTHAS are standing tied to a rock. The mon-
"sterous bear-like creatures are as large as elephants,"
"with huge red eyes, tremendous looped horns, and long"
furry dinosaur-like tails. The raiders mount saddles
strapped to the huge creature's shaggy backs and ride
off down the rugged bluff.
36 EXT. UTAPAU - SAND DUNE - DAY 36
The battered landspeeder is parked on the top of a huge
"sand dune. Luke, with his long-barreled laser-rifle"
"slung over his shoulder, makes his way past the bleached"
bones of a dinosaur-like beast. When he reaches the top
"of the ridge, he searches the landscape with his electro-"
binoculars. Threepio lifts Artoo out of the speeder and
the stubby little robot struts around stretching his
joints between irritated whistles. Luke is depressed as
he returns to the speeder.
LUKE
"According to my father's tapes, this"
"is the spot where General Kenobi lives,"
but the instruments just don't match
up with the landscape... There is no
"doubt about it, we're lost..."
THREEPIO
"If you don't mind my saying so, sir,"
I don't see how anyone could live in
this forsaken place.
LUKE
"Well, I don't know what to do now."
We'll just have to head inland and
see if we can't find a settlement.
37 INT. LUKE'S LANDSPEEDER - ROCK CANYON FLOOR (TRAVELING) 37
- DAY
Threepio maneuvers the powerful landspeeder around
"several massive boulders in the narrow canyon, as Luke"
intently studies the pulsing radar scope.
LUKE
Something is definitely in the next
canyon. There are two or three of
"them, maybe more."
I don't like the looks of it. It
could be Tusken Raiders or...
anything. You'd better stop and I'll
try to get a look at them.
38 EXT. UTAPAU - CANYON RIDGE - DAY 38
Luke carefully makes his way to the top of a rocky ridge
"and scans the canyon with his electrobinoculars, until"
he spots the two riderless Banthas. Threepio struggles
up behind the young adventurer.
LUKE
I think we'd better go another way.
There are two Banthas down there.
I don't see any... wait a minute.
They're Tusken Raiders all right!
I see one of them...
Luke watches the distant Tusken Raider through his elec-
trobinoculars. Suddenly something huge moves in front
of his field of view. Before Luke or Threepio can
"react, a large gruesome Tusken Raider looms over them."
"Threepio is startled and backs away, right off the side"
of the cliff. He can be heard for several moments as he
"clangs, bangs and rattles down the side of the mountain."
The towering creature brings down his glowing red laser-
"sword, but Luke manages to block the blow with his"
"laser-rifle, which is neatly cut in half. The terrified"
farm boy scrambles backward until he is able to ignite
his own laser-sword and defend himself. In a flurry of
blows Luke is forced to the edge of a deep crevice. Luke
"stumbles under the mighty blows of the fearsome creature,"
drops his sword and almost tumbles over the cliff to his
death. He hangs on for dear life as his feet dangle
over the abyss. The sinister Raider stands over him and
lets out a horrible shrieking laugh that echoes
throughout the canyon.
39 EXT. UTAPAU - ROCK CANYON FLOOR - DAY 39
Artoo forces himself into the shadows of a small alcove
in the rocks as the vicious Tuskens walk past carrying
armloads of supplies from the battered landspeeder. As
"they disappear, Artoo squirms out of his hiding place"
and waddles into the clearing where the speeder is
parked.
"The vehicle has been ransacked, and Luke is hanging in"
a state of bewilderment about ten feet in the air.
Large gold bracelets with small antenna are attached
to his wrists and ankles. He is spread-eagle and
slowly rotating. Artoo stands above his master and
beeps a few words of astonishment.
LUKE
"Well, don't just sit there. Get"
something to get me down!
Artoo starts searching for something in the speeder that
he might use to get his master down. He pulls a long
length of wire out of the engine compartment and ties it
"into a lasso. As Luke slowly rotates around, Artoo"
swings the rope and catches the boy around the foot.
"The line goes taut but rather than pulling Luke down,"
little Artoo is pulled up as if he had roped a windmill.
The stubby robot lets out an electronic shriek and drops
to the ground with a crash.
LUKE
We'll have to short circuit these
things somehow...
At that moment footsteps are heard coming through the
narrow canyon. Artoo scampers back into his hiding place.
Luke's face is a roadmap of agony as the footsteps get
louder.
A huge menacing shadow on the canyon wall gives way to a
"shabby old desert rat of a man, who appears to be at"
"least seventy years old. His ancient leathery face,"
"cracked and weathered by exotic climates, is set off by"
"dark, penetrating eyes, and a scraggly white beard. BEN"
KENOBI squints his eyes as he scrutinizes Luke in his
predicament.
BEN
Good morning!
LUKE
"What do you mean, 'good morning'?"
Do you mean that it is a good morning
"for you, or do you wish me a good"
"morning, although it is obvious I'm"
"not having one, or do you find that"
mornings in general are good?
BEN
All of them altogether.
You seem to have gotten yourself
into a fine mess! What happened?
"The wizened old man begins to giggle like a child,"
putting his frail hand to his mouth in a vain attempt
to contain himself. Luke becomes annoyed.
LUKE
Tusken Raiders caught me off guard...
"Well, kill me or cut me down, but"
"don't just leave me here, 'cause"
I'm about to go out off my mind.
"Much to Luke's surprise, the old codger draws his laser-"
pistol and blasts Luke point blank. The young farmer
disappears in a cloud of smoke and drops to the ground.
The old man leans over the boy as he rolls over with a
loud groan.
BEN
"Sorry, but that was the only way to"
get you down.
LUKE
Couldn't we have tried to think of
something else first!
BEN
You're lucky those Tuskens didn't
boil you before they hung you out to
dry. They're not the friendly sort.
You'd best be moving on before they
come back.
Luke staggers to his feet as Artoo waddles up behind him
and lets out a pathetic little beep.
LUKE
Threepio!
Luke hobbles off toward the canyon bluff.
40 EXT. UTAPAU - GRAVEL PIT- ROCK MESA - DAY 40
Little Artoo stops at the edge of a large gravel pit
and begins to chatter away in electronic whistles and
beeps. Luke slides down to where a very dented and
tangled Threepio lies half buried in the gravel.
"He tries to revive the inert robot by shaking him, and"
then flips a hidden switch on his back several times
until finally the mechanical man's systems turn on.
THREEPIO
"What happened? I'm sorry, sir, I"
must have taken a bad step...
LUKE
Can you stand? We've got to get out
of here before those Tuskens come
back.
THREEPIO
"I can't make it. You go on, master"
Luke. It doesn't make sense for you
to risk yourself on my account. I'm
done for.
LUKE
"No, you're not. What kind of talk"
is that...
The young farmer helps the battered robot to his feet.
Old Ben and little Artoo watch from the top of the pit.
41 EXT. UTAPAU - ROCK CANYON FLOOR - DAY 41
Luke and Old Ben struggle to help Threepio into the
"low-slung speeder. Artoo follows them, carrying a"
clawful of tiny parts which have dropped of his friend.
BEN
What brings a young boy like you way
out here?
"Luke bristles at the use of ""boy."""
LUKE
"I'm Luke Starkiller, guardian of the"
Bendu.
BEN
"Oh, so you're a warrior then?"
LUKE
Of course. I'm a Bendu officer.
Ben studies the young farmer through narrowed eyes. He
suppresses a smile.
LUKE
Did you take me for a trapper of a
farmer? Good! Then my disguise is
all right. I was afraid I might not
look authentic.
"Luke notices the old man is impressed with his story,"
and begins to feel expansive.
LUKE
You can never be too careful in these
times. A Bendu officer never gives
himself away. I'm actually on a
dangerous mission that's of the
gravest importance to the...
Luke suddenly realizes the old man might be an Imperial
spy and a worried look crosses his face. Ben laughs
heartily.
BEN
You're right! I could be an Imperial
"spy. For a Bendu officer, you're"
quite a fool.
Luke is embarrassed and concentrates on making Threepio
comfortable.
LUKE
Who are you anyway?
BEN
You might say I'm part of the
landscape here. They call me Ben
Kenobi.
Luke is dumbstruck. Then with a combination of awe and
excitement he finds his voice.
LUKE
You're General Kenobi?!? The Jedi
knight! The commander of the White
Legions?
BEN
I'm afraid it's been a long time
since the White Legions roamed the
stars. But I have the memories.
Luke drops to his knees and bows before the old Jedi.
LUKE
I should have recognized you.
The old man rubs his beard in wonder.
BEN
I don't see why. I don't believe
we've ever met.
LUKE
I am the son of Annikin Starkiller.
The scruffy old Jedi smiles at the kneeling boy.
BEN
I know who you are. Stand up so
that we can talk properly. You're
embarrassing me. I'm not that
important.
LUKE
But you are... I know your 'Diary
of the Clone Wars' by heart. My
father...
A sudden thought crosses Luke's mind and his enthusiasm
turns to embarrassed silence.
LUKE
I... I'm not a Bendu Officer. I'm
not even a startrooper.
BEN
I know that.
LUKE
You saw through me?
BEN
You could put it that way.
LUKE
I assure you my intentions weren't
bad.
BEN
I know your intentions. I probably
know much more about you than you
realize. In many ways you're a lot
like your father. He was an indulgent
"man, but a clever warrior. Now what"
brings you out here?
LUKE
My father told me many stories about
"you. He said if I was ever in trouble,"
to come here... I need your help.
42 INT. CAVE DWELLING - MAIN LIVING AREA - NIGHT 42
The clean but spartan cave dwelling radiates an air of
time worn comfort and security. The image of the beau-
tiful rebel princess is projected from Artoo's face.
LEIA
... that you will be richly rewarded
for your efforts... My commanders use
fix Arra code... X loc tan too nine.
I am lost. The Sith lords will surely
take me to Alderaan. You must continue
alone.
There is a little static and the transmission is cut
short. The old man leans back and scratches his head.
He silently puffs on a tarnished chrome water pipe.
BEN
I'm afraid I've gotten too old for
this sort of thing.
LUKE
But you must! I can't do it alone.
I'm not at all like my father. I'd
never make it.
BEN
I already know you think you're
worthless. I recommend you learn to
"think of yourself in a better light,"
for what you believe you are is what
you become. I haven't been involved
in anything like this for many years.
LUKE
But the Sith Lords are involved!
Whatever information this R-2 unit
"is carrying, it must be awfully"
important. They're probably looking
for him... I'm no match for the Sith.
This is a Jedi's work. This is your
responsibility!
BEN
Not any more!
The old man suddenly ignites in a rage and swings his
left forearm down across the solid metal table with a
"mighty blow. His arm cracks in two, spewing forth"
wires and electronic components.
BEN
I'm not the same. I'm too old. I've
lost too much. You don't seem to
"realize I've become an outlaw, to be"
hunted... and killed.
Luke bows his head in sorrow for one of the greatest
warriors in the galaxy and a fallen idol. Ben is em-
barrassed and makes a needless adjustment on the pot
"belly thermal heater, which radiates a warm glow through-"
out the room. Little Artoo begins to pick up the pieces
of the old man's arm and reassemble them. The badly
dented Threepio breaks the awkward silence by noisily
standing up.
THREEPIO
"If you'll not be needing me any more,"
I think I'll shut down for awhile.
Luke nods his head. Old Ben leans back in his chair.
BEN
"Son, I'm sorry I lost control."
Perhaps we should talk about this in
the morning.
43 INT. CAVE DWELLING - SLEEPING AREA - NIGHT 43
Luke tosses and turns in his sleep. Threepio sleeps
peacefully. Luke keeps hearing the voice of Princess
Leia calling out for help. Suddenly he sits up with a
start. He hears Leia's voice coming from the main
living area. Luke climbs out of bed and quietly makes
his way through the darkened dwelling. He stops at the
entrance to the main room.
44 INT. CAVE SWELLING - MAIN LIVING AREA - NIGHT 44
Ben is sitting before the flickering hologram image of
Princess Leia. The old man rests his head in his one
"good arm. His back is to Luke, but he senses the boy's"
presence.
BEN
"Luke, come here... sit down."
Luke walks over and sits across from the old man.
BEN
You were right. It is my
responsibility. The Force of
Others brought the message to you and
then it brought you to me.
LUKE
My father used to talk about the
Force of Others. But he never told
me what it was...
BEN
Let's just say the Force is something
a Jedi Warrior deals with. It is an
"energy field in oneself, a power that"
"controls ones acts, yet obeys ones"
"commands. It is nothing, yet it makes"
marvels appear before your very eyes.
All living things generate this Force
"field, even you."
LUKE
(amazed)
You mean I generate an energy field?
BEN
It surrounds you and radiates from
you. A Jedi can feel it flowing from
him...
(patting his
stomach)
... from here!
LUKE
Could I learn to feel it?
The old man leans back and scratches his head smiling
slightly.
BEN
"That is not a human decision, not"
your or mine.
LUKE
What do you mean?
BEN
It means you'd better get some rest.
We'll be leaving for Mos Eisley
first thing in the morning. The
"trip will be difficult and dangerous,"
but it's the only spaceport with
ships large enough to get us to
Organa Major. Now go on!
Luke reluctantly stands and heads for the bedroom.
45 EXT. UTAPAU - ENTRANCE TO CAVE DWELLING - MORNING 45
Artoo and Threepio carry supplies out of the cave dwell-
ing to where Luke loads them into the landspeeder. Old
Ben emerges into the sunlight and stretches his new arm.
BEN
It looks like a good day for travel.
The Force is with us.
Ben walks over to the speeder and puts his hand on Luke's
shoulder.
BEN
"Luke, I'm coming along to do what"
"I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending"
on you to get us through.
LUKE
But you're still a powerful Jedi.
You don't need my help.
BEN
A Jedi's power is measured by the
amount of the Force that is stored
"within him, and I have little of the"
Force left in me.
LUKE
How can you store an energy field
within you?
BEN
"When a creature dies, the force it"
generated remains. The Force is all
around us. It can be collected and
transmitted through the use of a
Kiber crystal. It's the only way to
amplify the power of the Force within
you.
LUKE
Don't you have a Kiber crystal?
BEN
"I had one, but it was taken at the"
battle of Condawn...
LUKE
That's where my father was killed.
BEN
Yes. It was a black day. One of
my disciple's took the crystal and
became a Sith Lord. It was a black
day. The few crystals that remain
are in the possession of the Sith
Lords on Alderaan. That's how they've
become so powerful.
LUKE
Do the Sith know the ways of the
Force?
BEN
They use the Bogan Force.
LUKE
"Like Bogan weather, or bogan times."
I thought that was just a saying.
BEN
There are two halves of the Force of
Others. One is positive and will help
you if you learn how to use it. But
the others half will kill you if you
aren't careful. This negative side
"of the Force is called the Bogan,"
which is where the expression came
"from, and it is the part that is used"
by the Dark Lords to destroy their
opponents. Both halves are always
"present. The Force is on your right,"
the Bogan is on your left. The Kiber
Crystal can amplify either one. The
Crystal Darth stole was the last one
in the possession of the Jedi. When
"he joined the Sith, the power of the"
Dark Lords was completed.
"Artoo and Threepio are already in the speeder, as Luke"
and old Ben climb in. The speeder starts with a low hum.
46 INT. ALDERAAN - CRYSTAL CHAMBER 46
Three SITH LORDS are on their knees praying before a
shining crystal placed on a tall altar. They mumble a
strange electronic chant.
1ST SITH
"Darth, did you feel that?"
Darth stands and stares at the crystal.
2ND SITH
Was it an omen? What is it?
VADER
Something old has been awakened. The
"Force has suddenly grown stronger, We"
must travel future paths with caution.
They file out of the chamber.
47 EXT. UTAPAU - BLUFF OVERLOOKING MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT 47
- DAY
The speeder zooms across the desert wasteland and
eventually stops on a bluff overlooking the spaceport
at MOS EISLEY. It is a haphazard array of low gray con-
crete structures and semi-domes. A harsh gale blows
across the stark canyon floor. Luke adjusts his goggles
"and walks to the edge of the craggy bluff, where Ben is"
standing.
BEN
"Well, there it is, Mos Eisley. A"
more wretched hive of scum and
villainy can't be found this side
of the empire...
48 EXT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT - SLUM DWELLING - DAY 48
Luke stops the speeder before the remains of a burnt-
out spaceship the size of a large jet fighter. Two
"scruffy figures huddle around a small thermal heater,"
attempting to use the decaying building as shelter
against the howling winds. One of the rag-tag figures
ventures over to the group in the speeder. It is
obvious from his pint size that he is a Jawa. Artoo
lets out a string of electronic beeps and whistles.
THREEPIO
"I begging your pardon, sir, but watch"
out for this thing.
The wretched little creature moves close to the speeder
and begins to run his gnarled hand across it.
JAWA
Clinga fouf. Zoom zoom. Chiq?
LUKE
Where are the men who fly in the
ships?
Saliva dribbles from the dark hole where the Jawa's face
"should be and drops, splat on the hood of the speeder."
"Threepio repeats the question in the Jawa's language,"
and the vile creature points to the far end of the street
and mumbles something.
THREEPIO
He says there's an inn down the
street. Lots of fliers there. But
I wouldn't take his word for it.
The Jawa continues to fondle the speeder as Luke starts
the magno-system. The filthy creature reluctantly jumps
away as the speeder takes off and glides down the dingy
spaceport street. A giant lizard scurries out of the
wretched spaceship chased by a stubby Jawa.
49 EXT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT - CANTINA - DAY 49
"The speeder pulls up in front of a rundown, blockhouse"
cantina on the outskirts of the spaceport. Various
"strange forms of transport, including several unusual"
"beasts of burden, are parked outside the bar."
THREEPIO
I can't abide those Jawas. Disgusting
creatures.
BEN
Take care in here. I don't like the
looks of this place.
"Luke, Ben and the two robots climb out of the speeder,"
and brace themselves against the constant shipping wind.
50 INT. MOS EISLEY CANTINA - DAY 50
The young adventurer and his two mechanical servants fol-
low Ben Kenobi into the smoke-filled cantina. The
"murky, moldy den is filled with a startling array of"
"weird and exotic alien creatures and monsters, laughing"
at the long metallic bar. At first the sight is horrifying.
"One-eyed, thousand-eyed, slimy, furry, scaly tentacles"
and claws huddle over drinks. Ben and Luke move to an
empty spot at the bar near a group of repulsive but
"human Corellian pirates. A huge, rough-looking"
BARTENDER comes over to Luke and the robots.
BARTENDER
We don't serve 'their kind' in here.
"Luke, still recovering from the shock of seeing so many"
"outlandish creatures, doesn't quite catch the Bartender's"
drift.
LUKE
What?
BARTENDER
Your 'droids' will have to wait
outside. We don't serve 'em here.
Luke looks to Old Ben who is busy talking to one of the
Corellian pirates. He notices that several of the grue-
some creatures along the bar are giving him a very un-
friendly glare.
LUKE
"Yes, of course. I'm so sorry."
(turns to Threepio)
You'd better stay with the speeder.
We don't want any trouble. I'll...
ahh... bring you something.
Threepio and his stubby partner go outside and most of
the creatures at the bar go back to their drinks. Ben
"is standing next to CHEWBACCA, an eight foot tall,"
savage-looking creature resembling a huge gray bushbaby-
monkey with fierce 'baboon-like' fangs. His large
yellow eyes dominate a fur-covered face and soften his
"otherwise awesome appearance. Over his matted, furry"
"body he wears two chrome bandoliers, a flak jacket"
"painted in a bizarre camouflage pattern, brown cloth"
"shorts, and little else. He is a two hundred year old"
"WOOKIEE, and a sight to behold. Ben speaks to the"
"Wookiee in his own language, which is a little more than"
a series of grunts. The old man points to Luke several
times during the conversation and the huge creature
suddenly lets out a horrifying laugh. Luke is more than
"a little bit disconcerted, and pretends not to hear the"
conversation between Ben and the Giant Wookiee. He is
"terrified, but tries not to show it. He quietly sips"
"his drink, looking over the crowd for a more sympathetic"
ear or whatever.
"A large, multiple-eyed CREATURE gives Luke a rough"
shove.
CREATURE
Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!?
The hideous freak is obviously drunk. Luke tries to
ignore the Creature and turns back to his drink. A
"short, grubby HUMAN and an even smaller RODENT-like"
beast join the belligerent monstrosity.
HUMAN
He doesn't like you.
LUKE
I'm sorry.
HUMAN
I don't like you either.
The big Creature is getting agitated and yells some
unintelligible gibberish at the now rather nervous
young adventurer.
HUMAN
Don't insult us. You just watch
yourself. We're wanted men. I
have the death sentence on twelve
systems.
LUKE
I'll be careful then.
HUMAN
You'll be dead.
The rodent lets out a loud grunt and everything at the
"bar moves away. Luke tries to remain cool, but it"
isn't easy. His three adversaries ready their weapons.
Old Ben moves in behind Luke.
BEN
This little one isn't worth the
effort. Come let me buy you
something...
A powerful blow from the unpleasant Creature sends the
"young would-be Jedi sailing across the room, crashing"
through tables and breaking a large jug filled with a
"foul-looking liquid. With a blood-curdling shriek, the"
monster draws a wicked chrome laser pistol from his belt
and levels it at Old Ben. The Bartender panics.
BARTENDER
No blasters! No blasters!
"With an astounding agility, Old Ben's laser-sword sparks"
to life and in a flash an arm lies on the floor. The
"rodent is cut in two and the giant, multiple-eyed Creature"
"lies doubled, cut from chin to groin. Ben carefully and"
precisely turns off his laser-sword and replaces it on
"his utility belt. Luke, shaking and totally amazed at"
"the old man's abilities, attempts to stand. The entire"
fight has lasted only a matter of seconds. The cantina
"goes back to normal, although Ben is given a respectable"
"amount of room at the bar. Luke, rubbing his bruised"
"head, approaches the old man with new awe."
BEN
Chewbacca here is first-mate on a
ship that might suit our needs.
"Luke is still giddy, and downs a fresh drink."
51 EXT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT - ALLEYWAY - DUSK 51
"Luke, Ben and the two lumbering robots follow the giant"
Wookiee along a narrow slum alleyway crowded with
darkly-clad creatures hawking exotic goods in dingy
"little stalls. Men, monsters and robots crouch in waste-"
filled doorways whispering and hiding from the hot winds.
The group enters a small doorway n a decaying stone
building at the far end of the alley. Several robots
guide a small herd of anteaters down the street.
52 INT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT - DOCKING AREA 23 52
Chewbacca leads the group along a tall gantry over-
looking a long Rube Goldburg-pieced together contrap-
"tion, which can only be loosely called a spaceship."
Luke gives Old Ben a skeptical look. Old Ben just
"smiles. As they approach the ship, it looks even more"
homemade and shabby than it did at a distance. The
"Wookiee calls out to someone inside the ship, but there"
is no reply.
LUKE
What a piece of junk. This ship
isn't going to get us anywhere!
A tall figure steps out of the shadows of the imposing
spacecraft.
"This is HAN SOLO, a tough James Dean style starpilot"
about twenty-five years old. A cowboy in a starship
"-- simple, sentimental and cocksure of himself."
HAN
This ship has been to Terminus and
back. There isn't anyplace she
can't go. She may not look like
"much, but she's special. I built"
"her myself, and there is nothing"
faster... What can I do for you?
Chewbacca steps forward and explains who the strangers
are and what they want.
HAN
"I'm Han Solo, Captain of this"
vessel. Who's in charge then?
BEN
I'm Ben Kenobi. Luke Starkiller
here is leading our expedition.
"Luke is taken by surprise, thinking that Ben was going"
to take care of things. Han turns to Luke.
HAN
Organa Major is a rebel system.
There will be quite a few starfleet
patrols between here and there...
It could be a little tricky if you
want to avoid them... ten thousand.
LUKE
That's pretty steep. We'd like to
talk it over first.
Ben and Luke step to one side.
LUKE
We don't have that kind of money.
How much do you think I can get for
the speeder?
BEN
"Five, maybe. Let me handle it."
Ben turns back to the young starcaptain.
BEN
Five thousand now and five thousand
on arrival.
Han thinks about this for a second.
HAN
You got yourself a ship. We can leave
as soon as you're ready.
LUKE
We have a little business to take care
"of first, but it shouldn't take long."
We'll be back shortly.
Artoo and Threepio follow Luke and Ben as they hurry
out of the starship hangar.
LUKE
What if we can't get five thousand?
Ben glances back at Threepio.
BEN
We may have to sell one the
droids.
A great worry sweeps across Luke's face as he looks back
at the two unaware robots faithfully following after
them.
Han Solo grins and slaps the monsterous wookiee across
the back.
HAN
"Well, old buddy, we're free, and it's"
an easy charter at that.
"Chewbacca doesn't share Han's enthusiasm, and makes a"
couple of worrisome grunts.
HAN
"Yeah, yeah, I know we still have a"
"problem, but maybe we'll be gone by"
the time H2 gets back.
A commotion filters down from the entry gantry and Chew-
bacca whines pessimistic comment. A dozen or so gruff
and grisly pirates approach the ship. The grossest of
the slavering hulks is JABBA THE HUTT. His scarred face
is a grim testimonial to his prowess as a vicious killer.
HAN
You're back early.
JABBA
A shipment of Covina just took off
for Gordon. I thought we might
reroute it back here.
He laughs maniacally. Han is not amused.
HAN
You'll have to get yourself another
"boy, Jabba. I've got a charter."
JABBA
"Forget it. We settled this before,"
remember? There's no getting out.
Now get this 'can' started...
It's a moment of great tension. Han glances at the
four pirates standing near them. Two of the greasy
brigands have their weapons pointed at him. The young
starcaptain stands firm for a few moments with his hand
resting on his utility belt only inches from his
blaster. Chewbacca sways back and forth as he adjusts
his weight from one foot to the other.
JABBA
Well??
Han turns and reluctantly boards the ship. Jabba walks
alongside Han and puts his arm around him.
JABBA
"Han, after all we've been through,"
I'm disappointed we're not closer.
You're getting soft now that the
ship's finished. You may have built
"this bucket, but never forget who"
"paid for it, 'cause if you try to"
"take her out again, I won't be so"
understanding.
53 INT. MOS EISLEY - USED SPEEDER LOT - GARAGE OFFICE - 53
NIGHT
"Ben, Luke and the robots are standing in a sleazy"
"used-speeder lot, talking with a tall, grotesque, insect-"
like used speeder dealer. Only Threepio can understand
the creature's weird buzzing dialogue. Strange exotic
bodies and spindly legged beasts pass by outside. Once
in a while a large lizard or strange animal scurries
across the junk-strewn floor.
THREEPIO
He says it's the best he can do.
"Since the XP-21 came out, they just"
aren't in demand any more.
Luke scratches his head and ponders the situation.
LUKE
Four thousand isn't going to do it...
"He looks at Ben, then Artoo, and finally Threepio."
LUKE
(to Ben)
I think we're going to need them.
Blast it!
THREEPIO
"Sir, I have a couple of extra"
circuits. Perhaps they might bring
something.
LUKE
"Well, ask him. Tell him we need"
five thousand.
"Threepio buzzes to the salesman, who shakes his head."
THREEPIO
"Forty-seven hundred, no more."
BEN
He's bluffing. He'll pay five. Let's
go.
They turn and start out of the rundown showroom.
LUKE
This is the last place. Shouldn't
we just take what we can get and
think of something else?
BEN
He's bluffing...
Ben helps Artoo into the speeder as Luke climbs in the
"pilot's seat. The speeder starts up with a loud hum,"
"but before Luke can back out of the garage area, the"
insect stops them.
THREEPIO
Five thousand!
Luke breaks out in a big smile and Ben manages a slight
grin.
54 INT. PIRATE STARSHIP - MAIN PASSAGEWAY 54
As Han and the huge Wookiee work their way past the sin-
"ister Jabba the Hutt, the pirate hands the young star-"
captain a bulky cloak.
JABBA
"Take this back with you, boy."
Han doesn't mask his hatred for the loathsome pirate
"very well, but takes the cloak and follows the Chew-"
bacca toward the back of the ship. He stops by a small
"control panel, knocking it loose with his foot. The"
cover falls to the floor with a muted clang and the
young mechanic looks around to see if anyone heard.
HAN
"This is it. If this doesn't work,"
we're diced!
He takes a small metal bar and jams it between two cir-
"cuits, causing sparks to fly. He quickly replaces the"
cover and Han casually heads back toward the cockpit.
55 INT. PIRATE STARSHIP - COCKPIT 55
A short greasy looking pirate sits at the complex con-
trols of the ship.
PIRATE PILOT
We're on our way...
He pulls back on the power lever and the ship erupts
into a cacophony of warning alarms and flashing lights.
Smoke begins to issue from the panels. The pilot is
startled and begins flipping switches wildly.
PIRATE PILOT
"I think... ahh, I have a problem here"
... one of the reactor's gone wild.
"Captain, I have a reading way over"
a thousand.
Han rushes into the cockpit with a look of mock sur-
prise on his face.
HAN
What's going on?
PIRATE PILOT
You tell me! You built it.
Han works at the control console in a vain attempt to
figure out what's going on.
HAN
I don't understand it. Look at that
gauge. We should have all been clown
to micro-dust by now... Did I
remember to...
"Before Han can finish, the pilot has fled."
56 EXT. PIRATE STARSHIP - ENTRY RAMP - NIGHT 56
Jabba the Hutt and his crew scramble over one another
trying to flee the starship before it goes super-nova.
57 INT. PIRATE STARSHIP - MAIN PASSAGEWAY 57
The alarm system is suddenly cut short. Han quickly
replaces the control panel and turns to see a foul-
looking pirate named MONTROSS standing over him.
MONTROSS
"So, you've solved the problem, or"
maybe you are the problem. Get up.
I'm taking you to the captain. He'll
sting you good...
HAN
Not this time!
"Montross reaches for his laser-pistol, but Han is"
faster and gets the drop on him.
HAN
"Drop it, Montross. I always said"
"you were slow. You clumsy oaf, a"
club is more your style.
Han struggles to his feet and leads the pirate to the
escape hatch.
58 EXT. PIRATE STARSHIP - ENTRY RAMP 58
Chewbacca appears at the main hatch holding a hidden
"gun on Montross as Ben, Luke and the robots saunter up"
to the starship. The huge Wookiee lets out with a
loud wail that startles Luke.
BEN
We're coming! We're coming.
Han rushes toward the cockpit as Chewbacca helps Ben
aboard the starship. The Wookiee shoves Montross out
the hatch just as it slams shut.
HAN
"We're a little rushed, so if you'll"
"settle in, we'll be off."
Luke is a little puzzled by all the smoke and confusion.
59 EXT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT - ALLEYWAY - NIGHT 59
A lumbering Jabba the Hutt and the remains of his ter-
rified crew stop in the street and try to collect
themselves.
JABBA
"What happened? Han? Montross,"
where's Han? Montross? Where is
everybody?
A strange assortment of alien creatures and robots watch
Jabba from their cool alcoves along the edge of the
street. The ground trembles and the pirates turn to see
the mighty pirate starship riding above the dingy slum
"dwellings. The pirates stand dumbfounded, as the star-"
ship quickly disappears.
JABBA
He took the ship. He took the ship!!
60 INT. PIRATE STARSHIP - COCKPIT 60
Han sits back in the huge pilot's chair and puts his
"feet up on the control panel. Chewbacca, crowded into"
"the copilot's seat, mutters his amazement."
HAN
I know. Sometimes I amaze myself.
He chuckles as the surface of Utapau slowly drifts out
of view of the cockpit windows and is replaced by a
sparkling carpet of stars.
Chewbacca barks a few words of caution.
HAN
That's the price of freedom. But
"then again, they may never find us."
Once we cash in on this little venture
we'll head for the southern systems.
He'll be a long time coming there.
"Little Artoo appears momentarily in the doorway, makes"
"a few beeping remarks, then scurries away."
61 INT. PIRATE STARSHIP - SLEEP AREA 61
Threepio helps Ben and Luke put away their gear in the
cramped bunk area of the starship.
LUKE
"When we get Artoo's message to them,"
you think they'll try to rescue the
princess?
BEN
I doubt it. It would be foolish for
the rebel forces to come out of hiding.
I know your feelings. You'd best
forget them. It's for your own good.
There will be no saving her from the
prisons of Alderaan. It's the heart
of the Sith. The Bogan Force is the
most heavy there.
LUKE
But she's a member of The Twelve
Families. How can they hold her?
BEN
These are doubtful times. The
Empire has grown bold in its disregard
of the...
Suddenly Ben grabs his head and slowly collapses to the
floor. Luke rushes to him.
LUKE
What's wrong? What's happening?
BEN
"Keep away, I'm fine, I'm fine."
The old man lapses into unconsciousness for several
moments. Luke doesn't know what to do. Finally he goes
to Old Ben and lifts his head. The battered old Jedi
"shudders all over, then regains consciousness."
LUKE
Are you all right?
BEN
Yes... the Force... something horrible
has happened. I couldn't see what it
"was, or where it was, but it was"
terrible... terrible beyond
description... the cry of millions
dying at once.
Luke helps Ben to his bunk. He's still shaking from
the experience.
62 INT. ALDERAAN - PRISON CELL 62
Princess Leia is awakened by the blinding light of the
hallway as the cell door silently slides open and
Darth Vader enters the cell.
VADER
It is unfortunate you are able to
resist my mind probe. You are
going through so much needless
suffering.
Leia watches her captor impassionately.
VADER
The 'Death Star' has become
operational. There is no force
in the universe that can stop us now.
LEIA
They'll find its weakness.
VADER
It's too late... We already tested
it on Organa Major. It appears your
data never got through.
"Leia tries not to reveal the shock and pain, but she"
is stunned.
LEIA
No!...
VADER
It would be much easier if you were
to tell us where the outposts are...
Otherwise we'll be forced to destroy
every suspicious system... What a
waste...
Vader starts to leave.
LEIA
You'll never stop them... No matter
how many machines you build.
"The door slides closed behind Vader, leaving Leia alone"
in the darkness.
63 INT. PIRATE STARSHIP - MAIN HOLD AREA 63
Han enters the cramped but comfortable main hold area
of the starship and begins checking charts and various
computer readouts.
LUKE
Who's the pilot?
HAN
It's automatic.
Chewbacca and the two robots sit around a lighted table
covered with many small hologram figures. Each side of
the table has a small computer monitor embedded in it.
"Luke and Old Ben are sitting in the corner, the old"
man apparently asleep as Luke cleans a chrome laser-
pistol. he acts like it's brand new. he seems very
proud of it.
Chewbacca seems very pleased with himself as he rests his
lanky fur-covered arms over his head. Artoo immediately
reaches up and taps the computer with his stubby claw
"hand, causing one of the hologram figures to walk to a"
new square. A sudden frown crosses Chewbacca's face and
he begins yelling gibberish at the tiny robot. Threepio
intercedes on behalf of his small companion and begins to
argue with the huge Wookiee.
LUKE
(to Threepio)
Let him have it. You're winning
anyway. It doesn't make any difference.
THREEPIO
"I know, sir, but it's the principle"
of the thing.
Luke sights down the barrel of his new pistol. Old
Ben opens his eyes. It's obvious he wasn't asleep.
LUKE
(to Ben)
Are you sure you don't need it?
BEN
I rarely use it any more. I have
the Force. The Force is more
powerful than any pistol. You
shouldn't put too much faith in that
weapon. Work on becoming aware of
the Force... learn to feel its
presence within you. Try to sense
what it's telling you. It's the
only thing you can rely on.
LUKE
What do I do?
BEN
All you have to do is lose your
thinking self. Don't focus on
anything. Let your body do your
thinking... You have to learn to act
"on what you feel, not what you think"
"... If I had the crystal, it would"
be much easier. You could feel the
"Force immediately... but for now,"
let yourself go. You'll pick it
up... and someday you'll have no
need for that pistol either.
Han has been overhearing what Ben has been telling Luke
and obviously has a low opinion of the Force of Others.
HAN
I'd keep that thing close just in
"case, if I were you... I've been"
around from one end of the galaxy
to the other and believe me this
Force of Others stuff may make for
"good religion, but there is no"
substitute for a good weapon at
your side.
LUKE
You don't believe in the Force?
HAN
Sorcery! I believe in myself...
"I determine my destiny, not some"
mystical energy field.
BEN
"Well, we'll see..."
HAN
You might get your stuff together.
We'll be coming up on Organa Major
soon.
64 INT. PIRATE STARSHIP - COCKPIT 64
The cockpit is alive with humming meters and softly
buzzing readouts. Han is busy at the controls as Luke
looks on in wonder.
HAN
It checks out again. There is no
mistake...
Old Ben enters the crowded cockpit.
BEN
What is it?
LUKE
He can't find Organa Major.
Han is rather grim-faced.
HAN
I found it... It's just not there.
LUKE
What are you saying?
BEN
Organa Major has been destroyed.
Ben moves in and studies the monitors.
HAN
What's left of it is contaminated.
That's it there. Look at those
radiation readouts! It's impossible.
I've never seen anything like it.
What's going on?
Luke sits back and stares blankly at the monitors.
BEN
The Empire must have gotten here
first.
HAN
The planet has been totally blown
away! It would have taken a
thousand ships with a lot more fire
power than I've ever seen... If the
Empire had a new weapon that could
do this... I would have heard
something... I'd know about it.
BEN
"Well, now you know... The enemy is"
on the move. We haven't much time.
HAN
"Well, I've brought you here. What"
now?
BEN
We have to find he rebels... What
we're carrying belongs to them.
HAN
Their bases are very well hidden.
All the power of the Empire can't
find them... Do you know where they
are?
Ben shakes his head sadly.
BEN
"No, not anymore."
HAN
I'm not taking you on an impossible
search across the galaxy... I was
only paid to get you here and now
you're here. I'll take my other
five thousand and you're on your
own... I'll leave you on the nearest
system.
LUKE
You can't! We've come this far. We
must find them...
HAN
Why?
BEN
"Well, for one reason, we don't have"
your other five thousand.
HAN
Who's going to pay me then?
BEN
I think there are some things we
should talk about.
HAN
I'm beginning not to like you.
65 INT. PIRATE STARSHIP - MAIN HOLD AREA 65
Little Artoo is standing on the gaming table projecting
the princess into the middle of the group. Han has a
perplexed look on his face as he ponders the hologram.
"Ben leans back in his chair quietly waiting, while Luke"
"watches the princess with a wistful, smile, far-away look."
Finally the hologram ends.
HAN
How much do you think she's talking
about?
BEN
A million at least... If this robot
has information related to the
"destruction of Organa Major, you'll"
be able to name the reward...
HAN
Anything I want! Now that's
interesting.
He thinks about this for a few moments. Luke begins to
get a little edgy.
LUKE
Maybe you should just drop us off.
I'm sure we can find someone willing
to take the risk.
HAN
"All right, all right!"
You've got a ship! But where do
we go from here? They probably took
her to find the hidden bases... I
don't see how we can find the rebels
before she breaks. The Empire has
already beat us out.
BEN
She's part of the royal family.
They won't get any information from
her... She knows the art of mind
control... She's a swan sensana.
Ben gets lost in his thoughts for a few moments.
BEN
But she is the only link between us
and the hidden bases.
LUKE
You mean we should go after her!...
BEN
"I didn't say that, but it appears to"
be a logical alternative.
HAN
Now wait a minute. She's in Alderaan!
Ben is thinking and doesn't hear Han's protest. He
turns to Luke.
HAN
"No, it's impossible... No one, and I"
mean no one would venture anywhere
near the Alderaan system... I'm a
"free booter, not revolutionary. You're"
"aboard the wrong ship, son!"
LUKE
Maybe the fact that no one would go
there voluntarily could help us.
They probably don't think anyone
would dare try.
HAN
Don't you believe it.
BEN
Luke's got a point...
... Fear is their greatest defense...
I doubt if the actual security there
is much greater than on Aquilae or
"Sullust, and what there is is most"
likely directed toward large-scale
assault.
HAN
"This isn't a game, you know."
LUKE
How many more systems have to get
blown away before you have no place
to hide and are forced to fight...
Don't you realize what's going on?
Han is slightly embarrassed by Luke.
HAN
"Kid, you take the glory and the good"
intentions and I'll take the reward.
BEN
Fear is their greatest weapon.
HAN
I'm not afraid of anything...
"Everyone looks at Han, and he instantly regrets what"
he has said.
66 INT. PIRATE STARSHIP - COCKPIT - APPROACHING ALDERAAN 66
The cockpit is a quiet hum of computers as Han works
diligently on a complex calculation. Chewbacca enters
the cabin just as the ship begins to shudder violently.
After a few moments the buffeting stops.
HAN
We've just passed into the first
perimeter. It won't be long now.
Chewbacca grunts an acknowledgement and points to a
very large and bright star out the front window bay.
HAN
"There it is! Alderaan, the prison"
system. Take over.
I'm going to go back and see if
"they have come up with a plan, or if"
we're just going to cruise on in
until they disintegrate us.
67 INT. PIRATE STARSHIP - MAIN HOLD AREA 67
Luke stands in the middle of the small hold area. He
"seems frozen in place, a humming laser-sword held high"
"over his head. Ben watches him from the corner, study-"
ing his movements. Han enters and watches with a bit
of smugness.
Suspended at eye level -- about ten feet in front of
Luke -- a chrome baseball covered with antenna hovers
slowly in a wide arc. The ball floats to one side of
"the youth, then to the other. Suddenly it makes a"
lightning swift lunge and stops within a few feet of
"Luke's face. Luke doesn't move, and the ball backs off."
"It slowly moves behind the boy, then makes another quick"
"lunge, this time emitting a blood red laser beam as it"
attacks.
"Luke sparks to life. With one amazingly swift move, he"
"turns and swings his laser-sword, deflecting the beam."
The seeker shuts off and lands on the floor.
"Ben is pleased, and Han is quite impressed."
BEN
You have your father's style. You've
done very well.
HAN
Not bad.
Luke is sort of embarrassed with all the attention.
LUKE
"Well, I practice a lot..."
HAN
"You're good with 'remotes,' but how"
are you against something living?
LUKE
I don't know... I've never fought
anyone.
Han smiles knowingly.
BEN
Enough. Now try it without thinking.
It's no good talking about the Force.
You must learn to feel it. Wear this.
Ben places a large helmet on Luke's head which covers
his eyes.
LUKE
I can't see! How can I fight?
BEN
Try to feel it. Use the Force...
LUKE
I can't do it. I'll get hit.
BEN
"Stop thinking, and start feeling."
Let yourself go.
Han skeptically shakes his head as Ben throws the
seeker into the air. The ball shoots straight up in
"the air, then drops like a rock. Luke swings the laser-"
"sword around blindly missing the seeker, which fires off"
"a laser bolt, which hits Luke square on the seat of his"
pants. He lets out a painful yell and attempts to hit
"the seeker, coming amazingly close, but he is hit"
several more times before he manages to finally deflect
one of the bolts. The ball ceases firing and moves back
to its original position. Luke removes the helmet and
"is a sweaty, exhausted mess."
BEN
"See, once you let yourself go you"
can do it. You'll get it.
LUKE
"I don't get it, but I guess I did"
block it.
HAN
I'd call it a lucky move.
Han in a split second draws his laser-pistol and blasts
"the seeker. The ship begins to shudder, then a distant"
warning signal goes off.
HAN
We're into the second perimeter.
They'll be coming out to blast us
shortly. I was wondering if you
had some kind of a plan or are we
going to try to blast our way in?
BEN
Check your data banks for all the
information you have on Imperial
procedures. Both of you will have
to learn...
HAN
We're going to get in by studying
Imperial procedures? I don't like
it.
BEN
"All right then, we'll use your plan."
Han slumps in his seat with a dejected look.
HAN
I'll get the information.
BEN
... and I want you to start cleaning
the equipment out of the scan-
shielded compartments.
HAN
What do you want with our scan-proof
lockers?
68 INT. ALDERAAN - CONTROL ROOM 68
A CONTROLLER sits in a huge complex control room with
massive screens projecting maps of various star
systems. An Imperial COMMANDER sits next to him.
CONTROLLER
No reply on any circuits... It's
drifting on a point twenty-seven
skew. It's not close enough to
identify.
COMMANDER
"Alert squad five, but hold them"
until we know what it is.
CONTROLLER
Should we alert the Sith Lords?
COMMANDER
I'll make a report later.
CONTROLLER
"As close as we can make out, it"
appears to be a Corellian gypsy
vessel... It's not under power.
COMMANDER
Send one squad up.
69 INT. ALDERAAN - READY ROOM 69
Chaos. Red scramble lights are flashing. Alert horns
and attack buzzers create an unbelievable cacophony.
Imperial starpilots in black armored spacesuits grab
their helmets and space packs as they scramble out the
door.
70 INT. ALDERAAN - HALLWAY 70
Pilots dash in unison to a line of small auxiliary
"corridors that lead to Imperial ""tie"" fighters. Tech-"
nical crews scurry here and there loading last minute
armament and unlocking power cables.
71 EXT. SPACE AROUND PLANET ALDERAAN 71
The long ornate pirate starship approached the gray
"gaseous planet of Alderaan. The ship is not propelled,"
but simply drifts crab-like toward the planet. As it
"approaches the surface, huge billowing clouds extend"
out like menacing tentacles. The peacefulness of this
nebulous idyll is broken by the increasing wail of ion
engines. Suddenly four sleek spacefighters from the
Imperial third fleet burst from the huge cumulus range.
The craft are small cylindrical power shells dominated
by two huge solar fins. They are flying in a tight
formation. Then two bank steeply and head toward the
drifting starship.
72 INT. IMPERIAL FIGHTER - COCKPIT 72
The Imperial fighters are one-man craft crammed with
sophisticated electronic weaponry.
The pilot is cold and professional as his craft closes
in on the drifting starship.
PILOT
No life forms appear on the scanner.
"Escape pods four, seven and oh-three"
have been jettisoned. Life systems
are still functioning. It appears
to be in good shape... Should we
"destroy it, or attempt salvage?..."
Do you copy?
73 INT. ALDERAAN - CONTROL ROOM 73
The controller looks to the Commander for instructions.
COMMANDER
We don't get many visitors. Let's
take a look at it.
CONTROLLER
(into intercom)
Send out a boarding party. Full
assault gear.
74 EXT. ALDERAAN - CLOUD SEA 74
Several of the tiny Imperial fighters drift in orbit
around the pirate starship as a block-like boarding
vessel attaches itself to the underside of the disabled
starship.
75 INT. PIRATE STARSHIP - HALLWAYS 75
"Entering through an escape hatch, several heavily armed"
Imperial stormtroopers cautiously work their way down
the main corridor of the pirate starship. As they are
"about to enter the cockpit area, they hear a loud"
clanking movement. The ferocious stormtroopers freeze
and simultaneously direct their awesome weapons at the
cockpit hatchway. Two of the troopers start to edge
their way toward the cockpit. The tension becomes
"almost palpable, until finally the gangling, bronze"
"Threepio pops his ""Art Deco"" head out of the hatchway."
THREEPIO
"Greetings! I'm See Threepio, Human"
Cyborg relations. I'm glad you
arrived.
I've been lost for some time. My
master and the crew departed after
we passed through a solar plague
zone. I've been drifting ever since.
The operation of astro-vehicles is
not within my capacity...
The OFFICER talks to his commander on his head phones.
OFFICER
Apparently a plague scare... no
contamination.... We found a droid...
proceeding to check out the rest of
the ship.
The Officer indicates that Threepio should move out of
the cockpit. Two guards grab the puzzled robot.
OFFICER
(to guard)
Hold this thing for inspection.
76 INT. PIRATE STARSHIP - COCKPIT 76
The Officer enters the cockpit. Threepio is completely
confused as the stormtroopers rush around completely
ignoring him. The troops search the ship with small
hand scanners. The Officer sits in the pilot's seat
of the deserted ship and begins to feed information
into the computer. He opens a com-line to the main base.
OFFICER
"Base one, this is Kuro four. The"
"aft generator systems are out, but"
most everything else seems to be in
order... I think I can bring it in
on its own power.
A TROOPER enters the cockpit.
TROOPER
"All clean, sir. We couldn't get"
into some of the supply lockers.
Should we blast them open.
OFFICER
Let the scavenger crews take care
of it.
77 EXT. ALDERAAN - CLOUD SEA 77
"The towering white oxide clouds pass, revealing the"
Imperial city of Alderaan. The magnificent domed and
"gleaming city is perched, mushroom-like, on a tall"
spire which disappears deep into the misty surface of
"the planet. The little procession of Imperial ""tie"""
fighters follows the larger pirate ship toward the
city. The Imperial Officer guides the ship toward one
of the numerous huge open bays that ring the specta-
cular city.
78 INT. ALDERAAN - PRISON CELL CORRIDOR 78
A cell door silently slides open revealing the uncon-
scious body of the princess slumped on a table-like
bed. Vader and two OFFICERS exit the cell and the door
silently slides shut again.
VADER
We'll get nothing more out of her.
1ST OFFICER
The hidden bases have to be somewhere
in the southwest. That's something...
I'll start a search operation.
VADER
Start a destroy operation... Wipe out
every system in that sector if you
have to.
The Commander approaches the Dark Lord and bows.
COMMANDER
We've picked up a Corellian ship which
was hit by plague. It's been sterilized
and we're bringing it in.
VADER
Don't worry about that. Alert all
commands to prepare the death star.
We're going into the southwest.
The Commander exits. The Officer points back to Leia's
cell.
1ST OFFICER
What about her?
VADER
Terminate her... but make it slow.
We might still get some information.
79 INT. ALDERAAN - MAIN FORWARD BAY 79
The pirate starship rests in a huge hangar bay. Thirty
or so guards march up to the craft as a ramp lowers and
the boarding troops disembark.
BOARDING OFFICER
It's just a piece of drift junk. It
has some interesting innovations
though. Send in a research team
before you start the salvage operation.
Post your guards.
80 INT. PIRATE STARSHIP - HALLWAY 80
A lone trooper runs through the hallway heading for the
"exit. In a few moments, all is quiet. The muffled"
sounds of a distant officer giving orders finally fade.
"Threepio sneaks down the hallway, pulls on a latch, and"
a panel on a row of low cabinets crashes to the floor.
Han Solo's head pokes out of the hold and looks around
the hallway. He then pulls himself out of his cramped
"quarters and struts around, stretching his legs. A"
second locker breaks open and Luke emerges. Chewbacca
pokes his furry head out of the first locker and Han
tells him the way is clear.
HAN
This is ridiculous. I tell you it's
not going to work. We're never going
to get out alive.
Ben Kenobi sticks his head out of one of the lockers.
BEN
Darth Vader is on this system. I
can feel him. I can feel the Kiber
Crystal.
HAN
Is that good or bad?
BEN
It's not good... unless I could find
the Crystal. Then it could be very
good.
LUKE
What about the princess?
BEN
You go after the princess.
I am an old man and would be of little
help. I must try to find the Crystal.
LUKE
I'm not going alone!
Luke is suddenly seized with panic. He turns to Han.
HAN
Don't look at me. I'm just a pilot.
I got you here... You've got to do
the rest.
BEN
There is a greater risk in staying
"here, you know. If you don't find"
"the princess, then the whole trip"
was for nothing... wasn't it?
HAN
I'm not going out there.
He slams a panel to the deck and immediately regrets it.
Everyone looks around as if an alarm had gone off.
81 INT. ALDERAAN - MAIN FORWARD BAY 81
Two GUARDS stand on either side of the ramp leading to
the pirate starship. One of the guards hears something
inside the spacecraft. The second guard hears it also
and speaks into the headphone in his helmet.
SECOND GUARD
We've picked up a disturbance
inside the starship. Proceeding to
investigate.
The two Guards enter the spacecraft.
82-83 INT. ALDERAAN - MAIN BAY GANTRY - CONTROL TOWER 82-83
In a small control tower above the starship a GANTRY
OFFICER speaks into his intercom.
GANTRY OFFICER
What is it?
SECOND GUARD (V.O.)
I don't hear it now... It must have
been the droid... Wait... what?
The transmission goes dead. The Gantry Officer
switches to another channel. The Officer's aide looks
up from his desk.
GANTRY OFFICER
"T-4, come in, T-4... Do you copy?"
Are you all right?
There is a bit of static and a heavily filtered voice
comes on.
LUKE'S VOICE
We're fine... Com-link jammed.
GANTRY OFFICER
Find anything?
LUKE
Nothing...
"The Gantry Officer gives his aide a puzzled look, then"
speaks into the com-link.
GANTRY OFFICER
"T-4, you sound a little funny... T-4,"
"what's your operating code?... T-4,"
are you there?
The only thing that comes over the com-link is static.
The Gantry Officer gets up and heads for the door.
GANTRY OFFICER
Take over. It could just be another
"bad transmitter, but I'd better check."
"As the Officer approaches the door, it slides open"
revealing the towering Chewbacca. The Gantry Officer
"is in a momentary state of shock, as he stumbles back-"
"ward. With a bone-chilling howl, the giant Wookiee"
flattens the Officer with one blow. The aide imme-
"diately reaches for his pistol, but is blasted by"
"Han, which sets off a series of small explosions on"
the control panel. Han and Luke enter the room dressed
as Imperial stormtroopers.
LUKE
Between his howling and your blasting
"everything in sight, the entire city"
is going to know we're here.
HAN
Good! I prefer a straight fight to
all this sneaking around.
"Ben feeds some information into the computer, and a"
map of the city appears on the monitor. He begins to
inspect it carefully. Threepio and Artoo look over
the control panel. Artoo finds something that makes
him whistle wildly.
THREEPIO
"We've found it, sir. Bless the"
"maker, this control board has one."
Han and Luke rush over to the robots. Chewbacca busies
himself with hanging the Gantry Officer by his toes.
LUKE
Plug him in. Let's see what we get.
Artoo punches his claw arm into the computer socket and
"the vast Imperial brain network comes to life, feeding"
information to the little robot. After a few moments
he beeps something to Threepio.
THREEPIO
"Level five, Detention block A-23,"
cell 2187. She's still alive...
LUKE
Send feed-back into the control
sensors in that Detention block.
BEN
That's straight through the central
core... up toward the top of the
"city... Once you've got her, avoid"
"the main transports, they'll shut"
down immediately. Your only chance
is through the service shafts.
There are no sensors there... All
"right now, get going, you don't"
have time. I hope you can remember
everything.
HAN
"We'll be back before you are, old"
man.
BEN
May the Force be with you.
Old Ben slips out of the control bay and disappears
down a long gray hallway. Han whistles for Chewbacca
to join them. Luke binds the huge Wookiee with elec-
tronic cuffs. The Wookiee has a worried and slightly
frightened look on his face. Han reassures him and
straightens his jacket.
THREEPIO
"Luke, sir! pardon me for asking"
"... but, ah... what are we to do if"
someone should discover us here?
HAN
Hope they don't have blasters.
THREEPIO
That isn't very reassuring.
Luke and Han put on their armored helmets and start off
into the giant Imperial city of Alderaan.
84-85 INT. ALDERAAN - DETENTION AREA - ELEVATOR TUBE 84-85
Han and Luke try to look inconspicuous in their armored
suits as they wait for a vacuum elevator to arrive.
"Troops, bureaucrats and robots bustle about ignoring"
the trio completely. Only a few give the giant Wookiee
a curious glance. Finally a small elevator arrives
and the trio enter. A bureaucrat races to get aboard
"also, but is signaled away by Han. The door to the"
pod-like vehicle slides closed and it takes off
through a vacuum tube. Han rubs his hand across a
series of small holes.
HAN
Gas... Old Ben was definitely right.
"If they discover us, we'll never get"
out this way.
He gives Luke a skeptical look.
86-87 INT. ALDERAAN - HALLWAY AND SUB-HALLWAY 86-87
Old Ben walks very quietly behind two Imperial officers
who don't seem to be aware of his presence. They pass
several stormtroopers and a robot similar to Threepio
but no one appears to notice Ben. The old man deftly
slips down a sub-hallway and hides in a shallow alcove
as a patrol of twenty guards passes. He rushes down an
ever smaller hallway and disappears.
88 INT. ALDERAAN - DETENTION AREA - DUNGEON 88
"The giant Wookiee and his two guards enter the old,"
gray security station. Guards and laser gates are
everywhere. Han whispers to Luke under his breath.
HAN
This isn't going to work.
LUKE
Why didn't you say so before.
HAN
I think I did.
"A tall, grim-looking OFFICER approaches the trio."
OFFICER
What code is this?
LUKE
I've got it here somewhere... It's
SPT 188544. You can check it through
"the... ahh, oh yes, lex-321."
OFFICER
It will take a while -- the cross
mode is acting up... getting feedback
from somewhere.
The Officer goes back to his console and begins to punch
in the information. There are only three other troopers
"in the area. Luke and Han survey the situation, checking"
"all of the alarms, laser gates and camera eyes. Han"
unfastens one of Chewbacca's electronic cuffs and shrugs
to Luke.
Suddenly Chewbacca throws up his hands and lets out with
one of his ear-piercing howls. He grabs Han's laser-
"sword and ignites it, pushing Han against the wall."
HAN
Look out! He's loose!
The startled guards are momentarily dumbfounded. Luke
and Han have already pulled out their laser-pistols
and are blasting away at the terrifying Wookiee. Their
"barrage of laser fire misses Chewbacca, but hits the"
"camera eyes, laser gate controls and the Imperial guards."
The Officer is the last of the guards to fall under the
"laser fire, just as he is about to push the alarm"
"system. Luke rushes over to the com-link system, which"
is screeching questions about what is going on. Han and
Chewbacca disappear down one of the sub-hallways.
LUKE
"A Wookiee broke loose up here, but"
we've subdued him... There is a lot
"of damage, and three, no four,"
casualties...
INTERCOM VOICE
We'll send a squad up.
LUKE
"No need, everything's under control."
INTERCOM VOICE
With four casualties?!
LUKE
The... ah door's jammed. Give us
a few minutes to get it fixed.
INTERCOM VOICE
Who is this? What's your operating...
Luke cuts off the com-link and yells down the cell row
to Han.
LUKE
Hurry up. I think we're going to
have company.
89-90 INT. ALDERAAN - PRISON CORRIDOR - CELL 89-90
Han stops before cell 2187 and yells something to Chew-
"bacca, who covers his face as the young pirate blasts"
the door away with his laser pistol. When the smoke
"clears, Han looks in the cell and an expression of"
horror crosses his face.
HAN
"'Holy Maker,' NO!"
"Suspended inside the cell by invisible rays, a bloody"
and mutilated Leia Organa hangs upside down. A strange
yellow glow radiates from her eyes. Chewbacca rushes
into the cell past the dazed Han. The Wookiee yells
"something and Han comes to, firing his pistol at a"
small control box in the wall. The unconscious princess
drops like a rock into the giant Wookiee's arms. Chew-
bacca slings her over his shoulder and joins Han in the
hallway.
HAN
"Luke, we've got her, let's go..."
91-92 INT. ALDERAAN - DETENTION AREA - DUNGEON - HALLWAY 91-92
A series of explosions knock a hole in the wall through
which several Imperial troops begin to emerge. Luke
fires his laser pistol at them through the smoke and
flames. He turns and runs down the cell hallway. He
takes a small com-link transmitter from his belt.
LUKE
See Threepio -- See Threepio -- Jam
the emergency communications network.
Monitor what you can... What was that?
I didn't copy...
93 INT. ALDERAAN - SUB-HALLWAY 93
Han pulls up the rusty grate leading to a service pas-
sageway and helps Chewbacca lift the inert princess
into the black tunnel.
94 INT. ALDERAAN - MAIN BAY GANTRY - CONTROL TOWER 94
Threepio paces the control center as little Artoo beeps
and whistles a blue streak. Threepio yells into the
small com-link transmitter.
THREEPIO
"I said, all systems have been alerted"
"to your presence, sir. I respectfully"
suggest you return at once...
The transmitter squawks a short reply and Threepio peeks
out the tower window at the starship. All is quiet. He
then moves to the door and it slides open a crack.
"Several troops rush past, yelling and shouting order."
Threepio slams the door shut and pushes the lock lever.
Someone begins banging on the door.
THREEPIO
"Oh, no!"
95 INT. ALDERAAN - HALLWAY LEADING TO CRYSTAL CHAMBER 95
Ben starts into the hallway leading to the crystal cham-
"ber, just as two Sith Lords are leaving. the old man"
ducks into the nearest doorway which opens and swallows
him up.
96 INT. ALDERAAN - CLASSROOM 96
Ben finds himself in a small conference room filled
with about a dozen or so bureaucrats listening to an
instructor who is explaining a type of technical
philosophy. The class turns and stares at the old man.
"Ben raises his hands and all the bureaucrats, including"
"the instructor, begin coughing and grabbing at their"
throats. They are unable to breather and eventually
collapse on the floor.
97 INT. ALDERAAN - HALLWAY LEADING TO THE CRYSTAL CHAMBER 97
One of the Sith Lords stops in the hallway opposite the
classroom door.
1ST LORD
What is it?
2ND LORD
Do you feel that?
1ST LORD
I don't feel anything.
2ND LORD
Maybe you're too young. It's the
Force... If I didn't know better I'd
say we were in the presence of a Jedi
knight.
The first Sith Lord puts his hand to his ear as a message
comes through on his helmet intercom.
1ST LORD
They're calling for us again on the
prison level.
The two Dark Lords hurry off down the hallway and Old
Ben silently exits the classroom.
98 INT. ALDERAAN - DUNGEON - PASSAGEWAY 98
"Luke leads Han and the Wookiee down the ever-darkening,"
narrow passageway. Han and Luke switch on small lights
in their gunbelts. The rhythmic marching of storm-
troopers seem to be getting louder. Muffled voices can
be heard. Luke stops before an intersecting hallway.
HAN
They're right behind us. Which way?
Luke grabs his belt com-link and attempts to contact
Threepio.
LUKE
"See Threepio, do you read me?"
Compute our position... See Threepio?...
Static and no reply.
LUKE
Something has happened to them.
Let's try this way...
HAN
Let's try this way! Holy Maker.
LUKE
"See Threepio, come in, See Threepio."
I wonder where they are?? See
Threepio...
"As they descend into the bowels of the city, the eerie,"
slimy corridor becomes narrower and filled ankle-deep
with water and ooze.
99 INT. MAIN BAY GANTRY - CONTROL TOWER 99
A soft buzzer and the muted voice of Luke calling out
for See Threepio can be heard on Threepio's hand com-
link which is sitting on the deserted computer console.
Artoo and Threepio are nowhere in sight. Suddenly there
is a great explosion and the door to the control tower
flies across the floor. Four armed stormtroopers enter
the chamber. A muffled voice can be heard coming from
one of the supply cabinets.
THREEPIO
Help! Help! Let us out.
The troops inspect the dead bodies and release Threepio
from the supply cabinets. Artoo is shut down and does
not move.
THREEPIO
They're madman! They are heading
"for the prison level. If you hurry,"
you might catch them... they just
left.
"The troops hustle off down the hallway, leaving two"
guards to watch over the control room.
Threepio takes a round disk-like object and attaches it
"to Artoo's head, which lifts him a foot off the ground"
and moves him toward the door.
THREEPIO
All this excitement has burned out
"my counterpart. If you don't mind,"
I have to take him down to maintenance.
The guard nods and Threepio with little Artoo in tow
hurries out the door.
100 INT. ALDERAAN - HALLWAY 100
Artoo sparks to life and the two robots scurry off down
the empty hallway.
THREEPIO
That was too close. Now we'll have
to find another control socket an
plug you back in or everything is
lost.
101 INT. ALDERAAN - CRYSTAL CHAMBER 101
Old Ben carefully approaches the pedestal on which the
Kiber Crystal is resting. He gracefully sidesteps a
series of invisible beams. It looks as if he is doing
a strange dance. Ben stops about five feet in front of
"the Crystal. His eyes light up, and it appears he is"
renewed with a new inner strength.
Ben lifts his arms and slowly the Crystal begins to
rise off the pedestal and move toward the old Jedi.
The intense glow of the magical stone increases as it
passes through an invisible protective death ray.
"Just before it reaches Ben's hand, it passes through"
a blue beam that sets off an alarm which instantan-
eously slams the door shut and the room glows a bright
red.
102-103 INT. ALDERAAN - DUNGEON - PASSAGEWAY 102-103
"The passageway has gotten so small that Han, Luke and"
Chewbacca must walk sideways. The princess is standing
between Luke and the Wookiee and is semi-conscious.
102-103 CONTINUED: 102-103
LUKE
I think she's going to be all right.
HAN
Not if this tunnel deadends.
"Suddenly the way opens up to a wide, low-ceilinged"
corridor that is filled with water about waist high.
At the far end of the tunnel is a small light. Chew-
bacca puts the princess back over his shoulder.
HAN
I see a light. We may get out of
this yet.
The princess wakes up and is thoroughly confused by
her surroundings.
LEIA
What is it? What's going on? Where
are we?
LUKE
You're safe. We've come to get you
out of here... Just relax.
"The two boys wade into the submerged corridor, but Chew-"
bacca won't enter. He frantically begins sniffing the
air and jabbers something to Han.
HAN
There is no choice. The troops are
right behind us. Come on.
Chewbacca won't budge. He seems terribly afraid of
something in the water. Han wades back and pulls the
huge Wookiee carrying the princess into the water.
LUKE
Is he afraid of the water?
HAN
"No, he smells something... but we"
haven't time to worry about it now.
"The group moves forward through the dark corridor,"
unaware of the ominous ripples on the water's surface.
The giant Wookiee stops and howls something to Han. The
young starcaptain talks to the frightened creature and
eventually calms him down. The dim light at the end of
the corridor glimmers and becomes stronger.
"A loud, horrible, inhuman moan works its way up from"
"the murky depths followed by a huge jellyfish-like form,"
which shoots out of the water and towers above the pet-
rified group. Chewbacca lets out a terrified howl and
begins to back away. Han and Luke stand fast with their
laser-pistols drawn. The Wookiee is cowering near one
of the walls with the groggy princess on his shoulder.
Han fires directly at the center of the beast. His laser
bolt passes through the huge creature and explodes against
a far wall. The light from the blast reveals a little
"more of the Dia Nogu, which is transparent with long"
slimy tentacles.
HAN
It's not a natural creature... our
weapons are no good against it.
"The huge shape, breathing loud and deep, submerges again"
and the telltale ripples head toward Luke.
HAN
Watch it! Move back.
LUKE
Get Chewbacca. Try to get around it.
I'll draw it away.
"Han turns and wades back to Chewbacca, who is huddled"
against the wall. The Wookiee is shaking and wailing
like a small child. In the thin light provided by the
"small door at the end of the passageway, the faint out-"
line of the Dia Nogu can be seen as it swims by Luke.
LUKE
It just passed me. Maybe it's
harmless. I'm gong to try for that
opening.
Suddenly Luke is yanked underwater. Han has blindfolded
Chewbacca and is attempting to lead the Wookiee and the
princess toward the lighted opening at the far end of
the tunnel.
HAN
Luke! Where are you? What happened?
Luke surfaces with a gasp of air and thrashing of limbs
with a membrane tentacle wrapped around his throat.
LUKE
Get gong! I'll keep it busy.
Luke is dragged under again. Han grabs the princess and
makes his way around the treacherous creature to the
small opening at the end of the passageway. Luke bobs
to the surface with a severed tentacle dangling around
his neck.
LUKE
It's only light that doesn't affect
"it. Solid things, like rocks, can"
hurt it! Fire above him!
HAN
Move out of the way!
"Luke tries to swim away, but is grabbed by the creature."
Han fires his laser-pistol into the ceiling above the
"creature, knocking rocks and debris on top of it. The"
"Dia Nogu thrashes about for a few moments, then the water's"
"calm, and all is quiet. There is no sign of Luke. Han"
bows his head as the hope drains from his face. Chewbacca
"lifts the princess through the small opening in the wall,"
then struggles to squeeze himself through also. Han
"starts to turn back toward the escape hole, when Luke"
pops out of the water with a gasp and starts swimming
like mad toward the starcaptain.
LUKE
It's still alive. It's gone crazy.
Get out of here!
The boys rush up to the small escape port only to find
Chewbacca stuck. Luke begins pushing the Wookiee as Han
turns and fires off another blast at the ceiling. A rush
of rock and debris temporarily holds off the charging
Dia Nogu. Han helps Luke push Chewbacca through the hole.
Then the two boys scamper to safety just before the fear-
some creature begins another charge.
104 INT. ALDERAAN - UNUSED HALLWAY 104
The group is standing in a dusty unused hallway. The
Dia Nogu bangs against the opening and a long slimy
tentacle works its way out of the doorway searching for
"a victim. Han aims his pistol. The princess is groggy,"
but conscious. She takes command of the situation.
LEIA
"No, wait!! They'll hear..."
"Han fires at the doorway, creating an avalanche of"
rubble which buries the monster.
The noise of the blast echoes relentlessly throughout
the empty passageway. Luke simply shakes his head in
disgust.
LEIA
"Listen, blockhead, I don't know"
"where you came from, and I'm"
"grateful, but from now on you do"
as I tell you.
Han is stunned at the command of the petite young girl.
Luke bows before the princess.
LUKE
I am Luke Starkiller at your service.
LEIA
There'll be time for that later.
Now let's get out of here.
The group moves swiftly down the deserted corridor. The
"awkward silence is broken by Han, who's about had it with"
the princess.
HAN
I don't care if the entire city heard
me. All this sneaking around is going
to get us killed. I'd rather fight
my way out.
105 INT. ALDERAAN - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL 105
Troops carry the two unconscious guards from the pirate
"starship and march past Threepio and little Artoo, who"
are hidden near a tiny service panel. Artoo removes
the panel and sticks his claw arm into the socket. The
little robot's circuits immediately light up and one of
his antenna begins to spin wildly. Smoke begins to pour
from him before Threepio can pull him loose. Artoo lets
out with a few wilted beeps as he cools off.
THREEPIO
"Well, next time pay more attention."
You could have been fried... Are
there any other sockets around here?...
You must get back into the system
right away... or Master Luke will be
caught for sure.
Artoo whistles a mournful reply and trudges off behind
some canisters to look for another socket.
106 INT. ALDERAAN - HALLWAY LEADING TO CRYSTAL CHAMBER 106
A half dozen troops are milling around outside the
"crystal chamber. An Imperial COMMANDER approaches, and"
they all snap to attention.
COMMANDER
What are you waiting for? Open it up!
No one moves. Finally a SERGEANT speaks up.
SERGEANT
We were told to wait for the Sith
Lords to arrive.
COMMANDER
They're all up on the prison level.
The alarms short circuited again. A
relay feedback probably tripped it.
I think we can handle it. Unlock the
door.
The troops lower their weapons as the heavy door is un-
locked. The door swings open to reveal the withered old
"Jedi, standing with his laser-sword drawn. For a brief"
moment the Commander and his men are stunned.
COMMANDER
Shoot him down!
Before the troops can fire their weapons Old Ben has
"moved through them swinging his deadly blade, cutting"
the troops to ribbons. The old man flees down the hall-
way with what's left of the troops vainly attempting
to blast him.
107-108 INT. ALDERAAN - HALLWAY 107-108
"Luke, Han, Chewbacca and Princess Leia run down an empty"
hallway and stop before a bay window overlooking the
pirate starship. Luke takes out his pocket com-link.
LUKE
See Threepio... do you copy?
THREEPIO
I read you sir.
LUKE
You're back. What happened? Never
mind. What's going on?
THREEPIO
I'm afraid we're not plugged in at
"the moment, sir. We've had some"
problems.
LUKE
Are you safe?
THREEPIO
For the moment. We're in the main
hangar. Artoo is trying to plug into
the system now.
LUKE
Good. We're right above you. Stand
by.
Han is watching the dozen or so troops moving in and out
of the starship.
HAN
It's going to take a little doing to
get back to the ship. It looks like
I'm going to get a fight after all.
"The two boys rush down the hallway, followed by the lum-"
bering Chewbacca and Princess Leia. They round a corner
and run smack dab into twenty Imperial stormtroopers
heading towards them. Both groups are taken by surprise
"and stop in their tracks. Before even thinking, Han"
"draws his laser-pistol and charges the troops, yelling"
at the top of his lungs. The troops are startled by
this assault and start to back off. Han manages to cut
several down before the rest flee in panic. Pleased
"with his prowess, Han starts after them, yelling back to"
Luke as he goes.
HAN
Get to the ship!
LUKE
Come back here... Where are you
going?
Han has already rounded a corner and does not hear. Chew-
"bacca, quite upset at his master's disappearance, lets out"
a mighty howl and chases after him.
LUKE
Holy Maker!
"Luke is furious but doesn't have time to think about it,"
for muted alarms begin to go off down on the hangar deck.
Luke and the princess start off toward the starship
hangar.
109 INT. ALDERAAN - SUB-HALLWAY 109
Han chases the ten stormtroopers down a long sub-hallway.
He is yelling and brandishing his laser-pistol. The
troops reach a deadend and are forced to turn and fight.
Han stops a few feet from them and assumes a defensive
position. He is ready to cut them down. The troops
begin to raise their laser guns. Soon all ten troopers
are moving into an attack position in front of the lone
starpirate. Han's determined look begins to fade as
the troops begin to advance.
110 INT. ALDERAAN - SUB-HALLWAY 110
Chewbacca runs down the sub-hallway in a last-ditch
attempt to save his bold captain. Suddenly he hears the
firing of laser guns and yelling. Around the corner
"shoots Han Solo, pirate extraordinaire, running for his"
"life, followed by a host of furious stormtroopers."
Chewbacca turns and starts running the other way also.
They run around several corners and the troops drop
behind.
111 INT. ALDERAAN - NARROW PASSAGEWAY 111
Old Ben hides in the shadows of a narrow passageway as
twenty or thirty stormtroopers rush past him in the
"main hallway. He checks to make sure they're gone,"
then runs down the hallway in the opposite direction.
112 INT. ALDERAAN - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL 112
Little Artoo carefully plugs his claw arm into a new
"wall socket, and a complex array of electronic sounds"
spew from the tiny robot.
THREEPIO
"Wait a minute, slow down!... That's"
better. They're where? They what?
"They are? Oh, no!"
We're going to be mashed into conduit
before this is over...
LUKE
See Threepio! Do you copy?
113 INT. ALDERAAN - HALLWAY - BLAST SHIELD DOOR 113
Luke and the princess run down a hallway and reach a
complex blast shield door. Luke is talking into his
com-link.
LUKE
Are you hooked into the system?...
Good. Open the shield door... 11054B...
hurry...
Han and Chewbacca come lumbering around the corner and
rush up to Luke and the princess.
HAN
Can you get it open?
A multi-layered series of doors begin to open behind
"them, just as the squad of stormtroopers that are"
chasing Han and Chewbacca round the corner and start
firing on the rebels. Han returns the fire and the
hallway quickly fills up with smoke and confusion
as the final hatch swings open.
They turn and start into the main spaceport causeway.
A few steps into the causeway the group stops short.
"Two Dark Lords of the Sith, leading about thirty storm-"
"troopers, stride toward them. Luke and Han let loose"
"with their blasters, then follow the princess and the"
Wookiee back into the first hallway. Luke takes out
his com-link.
LUKE
See Threepio... Close the shield door!
Close the shield door quickly... lock
it tight!
The five layers of the door instantly slam shut. Laser bolts
continued to ricochet around them.
HAN
Now what!?!
Luke shrugs his shoulders. The stormtroopers continue
"their assault, filling the hallway with smoke and debris."
LEIA
"This way, hurry!"
She rushes over to a large slit in the wall somewhat
like a storm drain. She jumps through the narrow open-
ing as Han and Chewbacca look on in amazement. Chew-
bacca says something.
HAN
Go on! You big furry oaf.
He shoves the Wookiee into the tiny opening and the
Wookiee disappears into the darkness followed quickly
"by Han. Luke fires off a couple of quick blasts,"
"creating a smoky cover, then slides into the garbage"
"chute and is gone. When the smoke clears, the troops"
advance.
SERGEANT
Get this shield door open!
114 INT. ALDERAAN - SPACEPORT - GARBAGE ROOM 114
Luke tumbles into a large room filled with garbage and
muck. Han and Chewbacca are already stumbling around
looking for an exit. He finds a small hatchway and
struggles to get it open. It won't budge.
HAN
(sarcastic)
"The garbage chute wasn't a bad idea,"
"your highness, but unfortunately these"
trash rooms are vacuum sealed.
He draws his laser-pistol and fires at the hatch. The
laser bolt ricochets wildly around the small metal
room. Everyone dives for cover in the garbage as the
bolt explodes almost on top of them. Leia climbs out
of the garbage with a rather grim look on her face.
LEIA
Put that thing away or you're going
to get us all killed.
HAN
(sarcastic)
"Yes, your highness."
I'll let you open it then. It won't
be too long before they figure out
what happened to us. This has
turned into a brilliant escape!
LEIA
It could be worse...
"Luke and the princess go over to help Chewbacca, who is"
straining to open the emergency latch. Han moves about
in the muck. Suddenly the walls of the garbage recep-
tacle shudder and move in a couple of inches. Then
everything is deathly quiet.
HAN
I've got a very bad feeling about
all this.
Before anyone can say anything the walls begin to rumble
and edge toward the rebels.
LEIA
Don't just stand there. Try to brace
it with something.
They place poles and long metal beams between the closing
"walls, but they are simply snapped and bent as the giant"
trash masher rumbles on. The situation doesn't look
good.
HAN
"This isn't working, your highness."
The room gets smaller and smaller until it is only three
feet wide. Garbage is snapping and popping as it is
crushed by the relentless walls. Luke's com-link begins
"to buzz, and he pulls it off his belt."
LUKE
"Holy Maker, Threepio. I forgot..."
THREEPIO
"Are you there, sir? We're going..."
LUKE
Threepio! Shut down all garbage
mashers on your level... Do you copy??
"Threepio, shut down all garbage..."
"The rumbling walls continue. It looks hopeless, and"
then they stop. Everyone breathes a sigh of relief.
Luke goes over to the pressure hatch and scrapes some
muck off a number.
LUKE
Open the pressure maintenance hatch
on unit 366117891...
115 INT. ALDERAAN - HALLWAY - BLAST SHIELD DOOR 115
The huge blast shield door slides open and the storm-
"troopers on either side almost shoot each other, but"
quickly realize they have been tricked. The Sith Lords
point to the garbage chute.
116 INT. ALDERAAN - HALLWAY LEADING TO MAIN FORWARD BAY 116
Old Ben hurries along one of the tunnels leading to the
starship hangar. Just before he is about to reach the
"hangar, Darth Vader steps into view at the end of the"
tunnel not more than ten feet away.
VADER
I've been waiting... At least we meet
again... It could only have been you...
BEN
The Force of the Bogan has grown
strong with you. I expected your
master...
VADER
"You were once my master, but I am the"
master now... the Crystal will be of
little use to you...
The fearsome dark knight ignites his laser-sword and takes
a defensive stance. The two galactic warriors stand per-
"fectly still for a few moments, sizing each other up and"
waiting for the right moment. Old Ben seems to be under
"increasing pressure and strain, as if an invisible weight"
"were being placed upon him. He shakes his head and,"
"blinking, tries to clear his eyes."
VADER
"Your powers are weak... Old man, you"
should never have come back.
Ben makes a sudden lunge at the huge warrior but is
checked by a lightning movement of the Sith. A master-
ful slash-stroke by Vader is blocked by the old Jedi.
"Another of the Jedi's blows is blocked, then countered."
Ben moves around the Dark Lord and starts backing into
the massive starship hangar. The two powerful warriors
stand motionless for a few moments with laser-swords
"locked in mid-air, creating a low buzzing sound."
117 INT. ALDERAAN - MAIN FORWARD BAY - STARSHIP 117
Threepio looks up and sees Ben emerging from the hallway.
THREEPIO
There's the general! Where are the
"others?... Oh, no!"
Threepio ducks out of sight as the seven stormtroopers
who were guarding the starship rush past them heading
toward Ben and the Sith knight. When the robot ven-
"tures another peek, he spots Han, Luke, Chewbacca and"
the princess running out of a tunnel on the other side
of the starship and heading toward them. He pulls on
Artoo.
THREEPIO
Unplug yourself. We're going!
Ben sees the troops charging toward him and realizes
that he is trapped. Vader takes advantage of Ben's
momentary distraction and brings his mighty laser-sword
down on the old man. But Ben manages to deflect the
"blow, swiftly turning around, cutting a safety lock on"
"the blast door. Vader is standing in the access tunnel,"
"while Ben is in the huge hangar, and the heavy blast"
"door slams down between them, trapping Vader in the"
tunnel.
Ben instantly turns toward the troops. They stop in
their tracks and start to raise their weapons. Before
"they can fire a shot, a laser bolt explodes in the"
"middle of them, creating havoc. The troops turn around"
to see Luke and Han firing on them from the ramp of the
starship. Threepio and Artoo run up the ramp and dis-
appear inside the ship. Chewbacca appears at the door
of the pirate ship and throws a dead stormtrooper onto
the hangar floor. Luke turns to Han.
LUKE
Get the ship started!
"As Han starts up the ramp, Leia grabs the laser-pistol"
"out of his hand. Han starts to grab it back, then"
thinks better of it and rushes into the starship. Ben
"charges into the troops, cutting them down as he goes."
Luke is forced to stop firing and runs to the old man's
aid with his laser-sword drawn. Several of the troops
"flee in panic, but the two that remain fire their laser-"
pistols point blank at the old man. Ben deflects the
"bolt, but it explodes near him and he slumps to the"
floor in a heap. Luke cuts down the remaining troops
and rushes to the old Jedi's side.
"Ben is still alive, but badly hurt. A fresh squad of"
"stormtroopers appear at a second tunnel, and Leia fires"
off a blast that makes them duck for cover.
LEIA
"Luke, quickly! There are more coming!"
Luke struggles to drag the old man toward the ship under
the constant fire of the Imperial troops. Luke fires
back whenever possible and manages to keep the troops at
bay. The princess takes careful aim and hits the safety
"lock on the blast door, causing it to slam shut, leaving"
only three troops left in the hangar. The princess runs
down the ramp and helps Luke drag the old man aboard.
Luke puts away his laser-pistol and takes out his com-link.
LUKE
"Han, close the main hatch and get"
this thing moving!
118 INT. PIRATE STARSHIP - COCKPIT 118
Han pulls back on the controls and the ship begins to
move. The dull thud of laser bolts can be heard bounc-
ing of the outside of the ship. The princess enters
the cockpit with a worried look on her face.
HAN
Don't worry. They aren't going to
hurt us with those peashooters...
This ship is fully shielded.
119 INT. ALDERAAN - MAIN FORWARD BAY - STARSHIP 119
The pirate starship lifts away from the starship bay
and quickly disappears into the cloud sea of Alderaan.
The three troops continue to fire at the retreating
ship.
The blast doors quickly slide open revealing Darth
"Vader, an Imperial commander and many troops. The Dark"
Lord casually enters the hangar bay and speaks to the
commander.
VADER
Very good. It worked. Slow them
"down, but don't stop them. Alert"
all the tracking stations. We should
soon know the location of at least
one of their hidden bases. Alert the
Death Star.
120 INT. PIRATE STARSHIP - COCKPIT 120
Chewbacca enters the crowded cockpit and jabbers away
to Han. The young starcaptain jumps up while speaking
into the com-link.
HAN
"Luke, you'd better get to on of the"
gun ports. We've got four tie ships
coming in on grid five.
Chewbacca squeezes into the pilot's chair next to the
princess. Han notices the skeptical look on Leia's
face.
HAN
With your permission I will go and
assist young Luke. Don't worry.
Chewbacca's a better pilot than I am.
121 INT. PIRATE STARSHIP - GUN PORTS - AFT SECTION - 121
TRAVELING
Luke is firing one of the two main laser cannons
mounted in large rotating bubble turrets. He adjusts
his headphones and searches his electronic tracking
screen for the Imperial fighters.
LEIA (V.O.)
(over headphones)
Here come six more... grid two!
HAN
Was this trip really necessary?
Han jumps into the turret opposite Luke and begins to
strap himself in. The pirate starship shudders as the
Imperial fighters open fire. Luke's turret swings
around as he continues to return the fire. Moments
later Han lowers his glare reflector and with a burst
of smoke and electrical charge opens up on the enemy
craft. One of the Imperial fighters is hit by a con-
"centrated barrage and begins spinning out of control,"
until it finally explodes. Han gives Luke a victory
"wave, which Luke gleefully returns."
122 EXT. SPACE AROUND ARLDEAAN 122
Imperial fighters buzz about everywhere. The constant
flashing of deflected laser bolts reflect in the inter-
ior of the turret bubble.
123 INT. PIRATE STARSHIP - SLEEP AREA 123
The robots secure the wounded Ben Kenobi in a bunk. A
huge explosion throws Artoo and Threepio crashing
against the passageway wall.
THREEPIO
Here we go again. How did we manage
to get into this mess again?
Over the com-link the princess gives instructions as to
the enemy formations. Several more Imperial ships ex-
plode and disappear from view. The pirate starship
undergoes a great deal of punishment as the battle rages.
124 INT. PIRATE STARSHIP - COCKPIT - TRAVELING 124
"The cockpit is alive with warning lights and buzzers,"
but Chewbacca manages to keep things under control.
LEIA
There are only three or four left.
HAN
(over intercom)
"Chewbacca, it's time we showed them"
this isn't the regulation F8-88
Cargo Trawler.
Chewbacca pulls back on several of the levers before
him and the ship surges away from the tiny fighters.
The pirate starship races through the galaxy at an
incredible speed.
125 INT. PIRATE STARSHIP - GUN PORTS - AFT SECTION - 125
TRAVELING
Luke and Han continue to fire at the Imperial fighters.
HAN
At this speed they aren't very
maneuverable...
"One explodes, then another."
LEIA
(over intercom)
They're dropping away... We made it.
Luke and Han congratulate each other on their victory.
126-127 INT. PIRATE STARSHIP - HALLWAY - SLEEP AREA 126-127
Leia follows little Artoo into the sleep area where
Threepio and Luke are trying to make Old Ben comfortable.
Han finishes putting away some medical supplies as the
princess enters.
LEIA
All the data banks in Artoo are still
secure.
HAN
Then I think we're due the reward
you offered... and it had better be
substantial after what we've been
through.
LEIA
When Artoo has been safely delivered
"to my forces, you get your reward."
You have my guarantee.
HAN
What's that little 'droid' carrying
that's so blasted important?
LEIA
The plans and specifications to a
battle station with enough fire
power to destroy an entire system...
Our only hope in destroying it is
"to find its weakness, which we will"
determine from the data I stored in
Artoo.
LEIA (CONT'D)
We captured the plans in a raid on
"the Imperial shipyards, but we fell"
under attack before I could get the
"data to safety, so I hid it in this"
Artoo unit and sent him off.
HAN
Where are you taking us now anyway?
LEIA
The fourth moon of Yavin. I've given
the coordinates to Chewbacca.
HAN
I'd better go see how he's doing.
Han exits as Old Ben painfully lifts himself on one
elbow.
BEN
They let us go... They're tracking
us. They want to find your hidden
bases. They'll destroy the system.
LEIA
I know they'll follow... and they'll
"bring the Death Star, but our only"
hope is to destroy it before it
destroys us. Hiding is useless now.
With the Death Star they will continue
to destroy systems until they have
found us. We have no alternative
but to process the information and
use it while there is still time.
Threepio helps the old man lie back.
LUKE
Are there medical facilities on Yavin?
LEIA
He'll be well cared for.
128 EXT. SPACE AROUND FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN 128
The battered pirate starship drifts into orbit around
the emerald green fourth moon of Yavin.
129 INT. PIRATE STARSHIP - COCKPIT - TRAVELING 129
Han and Chewbacca are at the controls as Luke hurries
into the cockpit.
HAN
I don't pick up any life form
concentration down there. She'd
better be right.
LUKE
They must be shielded somehow. I'm
sure the base is there.
HAN
"Well, if it's not, we'll be facing"
that Death Star all by our lonesome.
130 EXT. SPACE AROUND FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN 130
Two small lifepods jettison away from the starship and
slowly drift toward the awesome deep green surface of
the moon. Retro-rockets automatically kick in and
slow the pods. The two tiny craft break through the
"light cloud cover and disappear in the dense, steaming"
jungles of Yavin's fourth moon.
131 EXT. FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN - VINE JUNGLE 131
One of the lifepods has come to rest in the middle of
"a small clearing. Han, Luke and Threepio emerge from"
the capsule into a forest of gargantuan trees shrouded
in an eerie mist. The air is heavy with the fantastic
cries of unimaginable creatures.
LUKE
I don't see how we got through those
trees in one piece.
A loud crashing sound is heard coming through the
jungle. Han instantly draws his laser-pistol and
then relaxes when he sees that it is Chewbacca leading
Leia and little Artoo into the clearing.
HAN
I don't see how we're going to find
anything out here. This terrain is
hopeless.
LEIA
Did it occur to you they might find us?
The princess has a knowing smile on her face as Han
looks around in the nearby jungle and realizes they are
surrounded by twenty rebel Aquillian rangers. The
rebel soldiers break out of the dark foliage and approach
the group. The princess meets them a short way from the
group and gives out a series of animated orders. The
soldiers begin to rush about. Four of them attach a
lifting disk on Artoo and easily carry him off. Two
other rangers help Luke lift Old Ben out of the landing
pod and onto a stretcher. The princess rejoins the
group.
LEIA
We must hurry to the base. We have
little time before the Death Star
arrives.
HAN
I'd like to get paid before that
eventually. I don't plan to stick
around for the fireworks.
Luke is surprised at Han's desire to leave and is clearly
disappointed.
132 EXT. FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN - MASASSI OUTPOST 132
An ancient temple rots in the dense jungle.
133 INT. MASASSI OUTPOST - WAR ROOM 133
In the bowels of the temple a massive and sophisticated
war room has been constructed. The princess stands
before a large electronic wall display surrounded by a
"half dozen field commanders. Luke, Han, Chewbacca and"
Threepio are milling around just outside the war room.
An OFFICER enters and hooks up a headphone to the dis-
play board. Artoo is standing near the princess with
his arm plugged into a computer panel.
OFFICER
The analysis is coming through now.
Everyone turns to the big board where various schematics
of a large round space station are displayed.
OFFICER
The cross analysis confirms a weak
"point here, near the north axis..."
The display flashes a close angle of the north pole of
the complex globe.
OFFICER
In an area somewhere below the
generating towers there is a small
thermal exhaust port. It is an
unshielded shaft that runs directly
into the reactor system.
"A large, sallow-eyed general named AAY ZAVOS fiddles"
nervously with a small hand computer.
ZAVOS
The greatest concentration of fire
power is at the poles... That exhaust
port looks too small to hit from the
air... We'll have to land an assault
force and use delayed link-weapons.
"The GRAND MOUFF TARKIN, the thin commander of the out-"
"land Kesselian Dagoons, stands."
TARKIN
An assault force is too big. Their
lateral defenses are too strong for
that type of landing. With all due
"respect, I suggest an attack with"
"our smallest, most maneuverable"
"ships. If we can get close enough,"
I think we can target it.
LEIA
Correlate the plan into the master
logic system. If there is any kind
"of probability ratio at all, we'll"
go ahead with it. Send out the alert
... We haven't much time.
Most of the commanders hurry out of the room. Two of
the generals stay with the princess and go over the
Death Star readout. Han and Luke watch as the com-
manders rush out of the war room. Han is getting im-
"patient and before Luke can stop him, he has pushed"
past the guards and approached the princess.
HAN
What about us? Are we to wait
forever? Is our reward to be blown
"to bits on this forsaken system,"
while your fleet mounts some suicidal
attack on that Death Star?
Part of my reward is that I be
around to spend it.
LEIA
I have little time for your
"mercenary concerns, but I am"
grateful for the service you have
given to our cause. What is your
price?
A grin slides across Han's face.
HAN
Ten million.
The two rebel generals look at one another almost not
"believing their ears. Luke starts to say something,"
but the princess turns to an officer.
LEIA
See that he gets it and quickly.
The princess then turns to Luke. She is very cold and
businesslike.
LEIA
And you?
LUKE
I... I don't know. I guess I never
thought about it... I just want to
help. I want to be in on the attack.
I want my own ship.
LEIA
If you're as good a pilot as you are
a swordsman... We're the ones who
have been rewarded.
134 INT. MASASSI OUTPOST - MEDICAL CHAMBER 134
"Old Ben rests in the cool, dim quiet of an electronic"
medical chamber. Luke and Han are by his side.
HAN
"Goodbye, Ben, goodbye, Luke. This"
is a charter I won't soon forget.
And I thought it would be a snap.
He shakes his head. Luke extends his hand.
LUKE
You're a good pilot... I've learned
a lot from you... I wish you...
HAN
"I know, but the chances for survival"
here just aren't great enough in my
book. I've got what I came for.
Now I've got to get back to my ship.
"They shake hands. Han starts to leave, then turns and"
winks.
HAN
May the Force be with you.
"Chewbacca is waiting for him outside the room, and they"
hurry off down the hallway. Luke turns back to Ben.
BEN
I want you to take this.
He pulls the Kiber Crystal out of his tunic and it radi-
ates a warm glow through out the small room. Luke takes
it.
LUKE
The Kiber Crystal.
BEN
Keep it with you always. You'll have
more need of it than I. It will
bring the Force to you. You've
already learned to feel it... Now you
must learn to use it.
Luke lowers his head in a kind of meditation.
BEN
You'd better hurry if you're going
to get to that briefing.
Luke stands up as Threepio and Artoo enter.
LUKE
You'd better be up and around by
"the time I get back. Threepio, take"
good care of him.
Luke pats the lanky robot on the back.
LUKE
"You've done well, Threepio. You"
have both served us well beyond your
"programming. When I return, I'll"
"have both you and Artoo retired, if"
you like.
Artoo lets out with a couple of soft beeps.
THREEPIO
"Thank you, sir. Your kindness is"
"greatly appreciated, but if it's"
"at all possible, Artoo and I would"
like to remain in your service.
LUKE
I'd consider it an honor.
He turns and starts out the door.
LUKE
"Come on, Artoo. We've got some work"
to do.
The stubby little droid waddles out of the room after
his master.
135 INT. MASASSI OUTPOST - BRIEFING ROOM 135
The Grand Mouff Tarkin stands before a large projection
of the north pole of the Death Star. Four squad com-
"manders (BLUE LEADER, RED LEADER, etc.) sit to one side"
of the giant readout. The low ceilinged room is filled
"with starpilots, navigators, and a sprinkling of Artoo-"
type robots. Everyone is listening intently to what
Tarkin is saying.
TARKIN
"... You'll have to come straight in,"
then at the last possible moment
level off and skim the surface to
this point. The target is a four by
four thermal exhaust port that runs
directly into the reactor system.
A direct hit straight into the shaft
should set up a chain reaction that
will destroy the station... the post
"is ray-shielded, so you'll have to"
use your torpedoes.
"Luke is sitting next to CHEWIE ANTILLES, a hot-shot"
pilot about sixteen years old. Artoo is sitting next
"to a little R-2 robot, who lets out a long whistle of"
hopelessness and skepticism.
CHEWIE (BLUE TWO)
A four by four target at maximum
speed with a torpedo yet! That's
going to be a neat trick.
LUKE
It's not so bad. We used to bulls-
eye womprats in my T-16 back home.
CHEWIE (BLUE TWO)
This will take a little more than
"a barnyard marksmanship, believe me."
"Red Leader, a roguish looking man in his early thirties,"
stands and addresses the pilots.
RED LEADER
Take a special note of these
emplacements. There is a heavy
concentration of fire power on the
lateral axis... also their generating
towers will probably create a strong
magnetic field. It is calculated
that maneuverability in this sector
will be less than point three.
TARKIN
We must have a direct hit. Yellow
squadron will cover for red on the
first run. Then green will cover
for blue on the second. Any questions?
"A muted buzz moves throughout the room, but there are"
no questions.
TARKIN
Then man your ships and may the Force
be with you.
136 INT. MASASSI OUTPOST - MAIN HANGAR DECK 136
Luke and little Artoo enter a huge spaceship hangar
carved out of the interior of the crumbling temple and
hurry along a long line of gleaming spacefighters.
Flight crews rush here and there loading last minute
armament and unlocking power couplings. Luke is
"stopped by Blue Leader, a rugged, handsome man in his"
forties. He has the confident smile of a born leader.
BLUE LEADER
You're Starkiller?
LUKE
"Yes, sir."
BLUE LEADER
Have you been checked out?
LUKE
"Yes, sir. I was considered one of"
the best bush pilots on Sullust.
I've also had six hours on the T-2.
Blue Leader has a skeptical look on his face.
BLUE LEADER
"Six hours, huh? Well, that's your"
ship there. You're blue five. You
stay glued to me. I don't want any
independent operations out there.
Personally I think it's foolish for
them to be sending fresh kids out
on a job like this. This is no joy
ride we're going on.
LUKE
"Yes, sir."
A warning buzzer sounds and Blue Leader smiles.
BLUE LEADER
May the Force be with you.
Luke makes a short bow from the waist as Blue Leader
hurries to his ship. Luke's ground crew has hoisted
little Artoo into a socket on the back of the one-man
"starship fighter. Luke climbs aboard the sleek, deadly"
spacecraft. Blue Leader gives his ground crew the sig-
nal that he is starting his ion engines. Luke's CREW CHIEF
pats him on the helmet and has to yell to be heard over
the ion engines.
CHIEF
That R-2 unit of yours seems a little
beat-up. Do you want a new one?
Luke shakes his head no.
CHIEF
Knock them all the way back to
Alderaan.
The canopy is closed and the powerful starship moves
into a deep runway shaft that leads to the outside. Luke
checks out the computer readouts as his crew locks down
the armament.
LUKE
"Artoo, are you secure?"
"The little droid, who is now part of the exterior shell"
"of the starship, beeps that he is fine, which reads out"
over the computer monitor. One of the crewman climbs
up to the cockpit.
CREWMAN
"I've removed the lateral casings,"
which should make you about a
thousand pounds lighter.
He hangs a small good luck charm inside the cockpit as
the canopy starts to slide closed. Luke signals to the
crewmen that everything is okay. Other crewmen say
"goodbye to their pilots, some serious, some kidding --"
all with a great deal of hidden emotion.
137 EXT. FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN - MASASSI OUTPOST - JUNGLE 137
All that can be seen of the fortress is a lone guard
standing on a small pedestal jutting out above the
"dense jungle. The muted, gruesome crying sounds that"
naturally permeate this eerie purgatory are overwhelmed
by the thundering din of ion rockets as four silver
starships catapult from the foliage in a tight forma-
tion and disappear into the morning cloud cover.
138 INT. MASASSI OUTPOST - WAR ROOM 138
The princess sits quietly before the giant display show-
ing the planet of Yavin and her four moons. The red dot
that represents the Death Star moves ever closer to the
system. A series of green dots appear around the fourth
moon. The Grand Mouff Tarkin stands behind the princess
with several other field commanders.
TARKIN
They're all away. For the first
"time since the take-over, I feel"
real hope.
Everyone turns as Threepio enters with Old Ben who is
walking with a chrome cane. The old man smiles at the
young princess.
LEIA
Switch them to the main com-link
system. Let everyone hear it.
The voices of the starpilots are broadcast into the
room.
BLUE LEADER (V.O.)
"Masassi Base, we have visual contact."
139 EXT. SPACE AROUND FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN 139
A small bright speck orbiting the huge red planet of
Yavin sparkles in the light of the distant sun. Eight
"rebel starships settle ominously into the foreground,"
moving swiftly toward the orbiting speck. As the
"starships move closer, the awesome size of the gargan-"
tuan Imperial space fortress is revealed.
140 INT. BLUE LEADER STARSHIP - COCKPIT - TRAVELING 140
"Blue Leader, in the first ship, signals to the other"
pilots in his wing group. The many monitors are filled
with various computer readouts and displays. Over the
com-link one of the other starpilots (BLUE SIX) reports
to Blue Leader.
BLUE SIX (V.O.)
(intercom)
Look at the size of that thing!
BLUE LEADER
"Cut off, Blue Six. Stand by. Blue"
"group, move in to cover the south."
"Red group, try for the exhaust port."
Settle in. Here we go.
141 INT. LUKE'S STARSHIP - COCKPIT - TRAVELING 141
Luke adjusts the controls of the tiny starfighter and
lowers the sunshade on his goggles.
BLUE LEADER (V.O.)
"Blue Five, does that glare bother"
you?
LUKE (BLUE FIVE)
I've got it blocked. I'm all right.
142 EXT. SPACE AROUND FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN - BATTLE 142
Fuel pods are jettisoned. The starship fighters extend
their dart-like wings and break off into a power dive
attack on the space fortress. A barrage of laser fire
from the huge fortress creates a wall of death through
which most of the rebel craft miraculously emerge --
undamaged. Multiple laser bolts streak from the star-
"ship fighters, creating small explosions on the complex"
surface of the fort. Luke directs his fire at one of
"the prime power terminals. It explodes, generating"
weird electronic arcs that leap off the station's surface.
143-163 INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN STATION 143-163
"Walls buckle and cave in, sucking debris and personnel"
into the vacuum of space. Alarm sirens scream as sol-
diers scramble to large turbo-powered laser gun emplace-
ments. Officers yell orders through the smoke and con-
fusion. Man and robots of various shapes and sizes run
to their battle stations. Standing in the middle of the
"chaos, a vision of calm and foreboding, is the evil Sith"
"knight, Darth Vader. Several astro-officers run up to"
"him, still putting on the helmets and equipment."
VADER
Get to your ships. I'll take the
lead myself. We finally have them
where we want them.
164 INT. MASASSI OUTPOST - WAR ROOM 164
The princess and her generals listen silently to the
action of the starships over the com-link. The aides
and troops move about very quietly listening to the
battle as they work.
BLUE LEADER (V.O.)
"Blue One to Masassi Base, we're"
nearing the south pole transmitter
area. The magnetic concussion is
getting very rough.
We're starting our run. Tighten it
"up. Blue Two, tighten it up. Watch"
those towers.
CHEWIE (BLUE TWO)(V.O.)
"Heavy fire, boss. Twenty-three"
degrees.
BLUE LEADER (V.O.)
I see it. Pull in. Pull in. We're
picking up some interference.
BLUE SIX (V.O.)
"Wow, I've never seen such fire power."
BLUE LEADER (V.O.)
"Pull in, Blue Two. Pull in. Chewie,"
do you read me? Chewie?
CHEWIE (V.O.)
"I'm all right, boss. I've got a"
target. I'm going in to check it out.
BLUE SIX (V.O.)
"There is too much action, Chewie. Get"
out!
BLUE LEADER (V.O.)
"Break off, Chewie. Acknowledge."
We've hit to much interference. Blue
"Six, can you see Blue Two?"
BLUE SIX (V.O)
I've lost him. There's a heavy fire
zone on this side. My scanner's
jammed. Blue Five?
LUKE (V.O.)
"He's gone. No, wait. There he is."
"Fin damage, but he's all right."
A sigh of relief sweeps across the war room.
BLUE LEADER (V.O.)
"Watch your back, Luke. Watch your"
"back! Squad above you, Blue Five!"
Coming in -- about six ships.
165-171 EXT. SPACE AROUND FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN - BATTLE - 165-171
REBEL FIGHTERS
"Two fin-winged Imperial fighters dive on Luke, but he"
does a quick spiral turn and eludes them.
RED LEADER
"Blue Leader, this is Red Leader..."
We've marked the target and are
starting our attack run.
BLUE LEADER
"I copy, Red Leader. We'll try to"
keep them busy on this end. Blue
"Five, stay close now..."
Blue Leader and Luke (Blue Five) and Blue Four dive in
"unison through a forest of radar domes, antenna and gun"
towers. They are followed by four Imperial tie fighters.
The two rebel ships make a sharp turn and come around
behind the Imperial ships. Blue Four and Blue Leader
fire into the tie fighters as the six ships crisscross
the surface of the fortress.
Suddenly a dense barrage of laser fire erupts from a
"protruding tower, catching Blue Four broadside. The"
rebel spacecraft bursts into a million flaming pieces.
"Luke has a sudden realization of the danger he is in,"
but it quickly fades as another Imperial fighter moves
onto his tail and begins firing. Luke rolls away from
the enemy ship.
Blue Leader reacts to the loss of his wing man with a
renewed attack on the Imperial ships -- one of which
"falls away and hits a prime power terminal, creating an"
"arching spectacle. A chain reaction is set off, creat-"
ing a series of explosions leaping across the surface of
the fortress from terminal to terminal.
172-174 INT. Y WING REBEL STARFIGHTER - RED LEADER COCKPIT 172-174
A blazing and out of control Red Leader dives toward the
"Death Star surface followed by Darth Vader in a small,"
spider-like Imperial fighter.
RED LEADER
"Blue Leader, this is Red Leader."
They hit us before we could get down.
You'll need more air cover. Sith
Lords...
175-190 EXT. DEATH STAR - SOUTH POLE 175-190
Blue Leader see Luke has an Imperial fighter on his
tail.
BLUE LEADER
"We're on our way, Red Leader."
Blue Two (Chewie) miraculously dives his ship through
a virtual sea of laser fire and blasts the Imperial
fighters chasing Luke into dust. Chewie signals to
"Luke, who lets out a whooping cheer as Chewie veers"
into a victory roll.
BLUE LEADER
"Great moves, Chewie. Red Leader"
needs some help. We're going to try
"for the exhaust port. Coincide, Blue"
Five.
Luke and Blue Three bob and weave in formation toward a
group of giant towers at the north pole.
LUKE (BLUE FIVE)
I see the target. It looks good.
BLUE THREE
I've got it. We're hit! We're hit!
LUKE (BLUE FIVE)
"Eject... Eject. Blue Three, do you"
read?
BLUE THREE
I'm all right. I can hold it. Give
"me a little room, Blue Five. Watch"
it! Watch it!
"Blue Three wobbles a little, then drops away sharply,"
"plowing into a huge laser gun emplacement, causing a"
hideous series of chain reaction explosions. The re-
maining starships of the Blue group fly in a tight
formation and dive between the tall towers near the
exhaust port.
BLUE LEADER
"Masassi Base, we're in position and"
"staring for the target. Chewie,"
hold your fire until we're within
point zero five four. Make it count.
"Luke, stay close."
Several ack-ack lasers begin to open fire on the
approaching spacecraft. The rebel ships direct their
"fire at a small, glowing blue hole at the base of one"
of the towers. One of the Blue Four's engines begins
to smoke and an R-2 unit pops out of the back and
attempts to repair it.
CHEWIE (BLUE TWO)
I'm on it.
"Blue Two dives directly at the small target, is unable"
to pull out and crashes into the base of one of the
"towers. Blue Leader dives between the towers, firing"
"away, but is unable to hit the small hole."
BLUE LEADER
It's very small. It's going to be
difficult. Send in the green group.
I'll try again.
Luke chases an Imperial chip that is chasing Blue Leader.
One of the two large fins on the Imperial fighter explodes
"and it careens wildly, leaving an erratic trail of smoke"
before eventually crashing into a solar panel.
191-195 EXT. LUKE'S STARSHIP - BATTLE 191-195
Luke swings the small craft around the many outcroppings
of laser towers and transmitters.
LUKE (BLUE FIVE)
"I'm right behind you, Blue Leader."
BLUE LEADER
What's that?
Out of the gloom streaks Darth Vader firing on Blue
"Leader. Luke tries to intercept the Imperial ship, but"
Vader outmaneuvers him. Blue Leader dives on the ex-
"haust port, followed by Darth Vader, who is followed by"
"Luke, desperately trying to catch up."
BLUE LEADER
"Blue Five, break off your cover"
attack. It's too late. Make your
own run on the exhaust port. Do
"you copy, Luke?"
LUKE (BLUE FIVE)
"Yes, sir, but I can get him..."
BLUE LEADER
"Forget it, son."
One of the five large engines on Blue Leader's fighter
"explodes. He careens wildly, leaving an erratic trail"
of smoke before eventually crashing into a solar panel.
Luke can hear the sharp laugh of Vader over the com-link.
196 INT. VADER'S IMPERIAL TIE FIGHTER - COCKPIT - TRAVELING 196
Darth Vader laughs maniacally as he swings his craft
around and starts after Luke's ship.
VADER
"You're next, Blue Five... I have"
this feeling I know you. The Force
is strong with you.
197 INT. LUKE'S STARSHIP - COCKPIT - TRAVELING 197
Luke's hand instinctively goes to the pocket that holds
the Kiber Crystal. Its glow lights up the entire cabin.
LUKE (BLUE FIVE)
I am Luke Starkiller. Had we met
"earlier, you would not be here."
198 INT. MASASSI OUTPOST - WAR ROOM 198
"On the computer display board, several of the markers"
indicating rebel fighters go dark. The princess gives
Old Ben a look of amused surprise at Luke's boldness.
GENERAL DODANA approaches the princess.
DODANA
Over sixty percent of our craft have
been destroyed. The probability
projection shows little hope. The
Death Star will be in position to
fire on us shortly. We will be
destroyed. We must escape while
there is still time.
The princess gives Dodana a hard look and the cowardly
general back away.
LEIA
There will be no retreat.
199-225 EXT. BATTLE 199-225
Luke (Blue Five) dives on the Death Star at an incredi-
ble speed. He soon realizes Vader is on his tail. He
"spins his ship to evade the pursuing Dark Lord, but"
Vader is still there. His ship rock and shudders under
the nearby impact of Vader exploding laser bolts. Luke
straightens his ship out and it skims across the surface
"of the fortress, creating a blur."
LUKE (BLUE FIVE)
"Approaching target. I', almost home."
VADER (V.O.)
"Not yet, my bold friend."
Vader hits one of Luke's engines and parts scatter in
"all directions. The ship wobbles, but Luke keeps the"
craft on target and fires his torpedo... It explodes
harmlessly to one side of the tiny exhaust port. He
pulls his ship up to try for another run.
LUKE (BLUE FIVE)
"Blast it! Artoo, we tool a little"
back there. My stability is off
about twelve degrees. See if you
can't jam the connecting relays.
We have to get stabilized.
Artoo pops out of his socket and carefully makes his
way back to the smoldering engine. Two other rebel
ships make a dive on the exhaust port. One is blasted
"away by Vader, the other fires at the exhaust port and"
misses.
BLUE EIGHT
There is just too much interference
with that Sith Lord out there. It's
impossible to get an accurate target
line-up with him there.
LUKE (BLUE FIVE)
"Hurry with those relays, Artoo."
We're going to try again.
Luke's tiny rebel fighter banks and prepares for a second
attack on the exhaust port.
Artoo struggles to repair the damage to one of the huge
engines. blue Eight moves in next to him.
BLUE EIGHT
"I'll cover for you, Blue Five."
The two rebels start their attack dive. The surface of
"the Death Star races toward them. Suddenly, streaking"
"down from above them, Vader and two other Imperial"
fighters sweep into view with all of their laser cannons
blazing away. Laser bolts explode around little Artoo
as he works frantically to repair the stabilizer. Laser
fire hits Blue Eight and he explodes.
VADER
"You were foolish enough to try again,"
Blue Five.
The three Imperial fighters dive on the lone rebel star-
ship. Luke struggles to keep control of the ship with
laser bolts streaking past him on all sides.
LUKE (BLUE FIVE)
Blast!
VADER
"The Force is with you, my bold little"
"friend, but now I have you..."
Suddenly Vader's wing man explodes into a shower of
burning fragments. Vader is surprised and looks around
for the cause of his wing man's misfortune.
VADER
"CTR-5, where did that come from?"
CTR-5
Collision course... watch out!
Heading right for the two Imperial fighters is Han Solo
in the battered old pirate starship. CTR-5 veers radi-
"cally, clipping Vader's solar fin in the maneuver."
Vader spins out of control. Han blasts CTR-5 to smoke.
HAN
I noticed you were having some
"problems, Blue Five... I thought"
I'd help.
LUKE (BLUE FIVE)
"Thanks, old buddy. I'll be with you"
in a second.
Luke levels his fighter and skims the surface of the
"fortress, through a wall of laser fire. Artoo beeps a"
message to Luke.
LUKE (BLUE FIVE)
"That's good, Artoo. Just keep it"
that way.
"As he passes the exhaust port, Luke fires a torpedo,"
which goes directly down the exhaust shaft. Luke looks
down at the glowing Kiber Crystal in his hand.
LUKE (BLUE FIVE)
We did it! I hit it perfectly.
Let's get out of here.
Luke veers sharply away from the Death Star as ominous
rumbles and explosions are heard coming from within the
huge super fortress. The rebel ship speeds past the
large pirate starship and several other surviving
rebel fighters as they flee from the pending holocaust.
"A sudden great flash replaces the fortress, and a rain-"
storm of rubble pelts the starships. Several giant ex-
plosions follow until there is only a smoke cloud where
the mighty fortress once orbited Yavin.
HAN
"Not bad, kid."
226-227 INT. VADER IMPERIAL TIE FIGHTER - COCKPIT - TRAVELING 226-227
Vader's starship with a bent solar fin limps into the
vast darkness of space attempting to make it back to
the relative safety of Alderaan.
228 INT. MASASSI OUTPOST - MAIN HANGAR 228
Luke climbs out of his starship and is cheered by a
throng of ground crews and pilots. Little Artoo is
helped off the back of the starship and he's greeted by
Threepio. Luke spots Han and Chewbacca as they enter
and runs over to them. he hugs the Corellian pirate and
the giant Wookiee. They all laugh and cheer. The crowd
"parts, revealing Old Ben. Luke goes to him and bows"
from waist. The old man embraces him.
229 INT. MASASSI OUTPOST - MAIN THRONE ROOM 229
"Luke, Artoo, Threepio, Han and Chewbacca enter the huge"
ruins of the main temple.
Hundreds of troops are lined up in neat rows. Banners
"are flying and at the far end stands a vision in white,"
the beautiful young Princess Leia. Luke and the others
solemnly march up the long aisle and kneel before
Princess Leia. Artoo and Threepio are rather awestruck
at the whole event. Chewbacca is confused. Old Ben is
"sitting to the right of the Princess, while the Grand"
Mouff Tarkin sits on her left. Leia is dressed in a
"long, white dress and is staggeringly beautiful. She"
"rises and places a gold medallion around Han's neck,"
"then repeats the ceremony with Chewbacca, the robots"
and finally Luke. They turn and face the assembled
"troops, who all bow before them."
FADE OUT.

"Two WORKER DROIDS, PK-4 and EG-9, stand in the foreground."
PK-4 Whoever it is must be important if the Viceroy sent one of those
useless protocol gearheads to greet them.
"The door opens, and the Republic cruiser can be seen in the docking"
bay. Two darkly robed figures are greeted by TC-3. They move off
down the hallway.
EG-9 A Republic cruiser! That’s trouble… don’t you think?

TC-3 I hope you honored sirs with the most comfortable here. My

The droid bows before OBI-WAN KENOBI and QUI-GON JINN. He
backs out the door and it closes. The JEDI lower their hoods and look
out a large window at the lush green planet of Naboo. QUI-GON sixty
"years old, has very long white hair in a ponytail. He is tall and striking,"
"with blue eyes. OBI-WAN is twenty five, with very short brown hair,"
"pale skin, and blue eyes. Several exotic, bird-like creatures SING in a"

"QUI-GON Don’t center on your anxiety, Obi-Wan. Keep your"

OBI-WAN Master Yoda says I should be mindful of the future…
QUI-GON … but not at the expense of the moment. Be mindful of the
"living Force, my young Padawan."
"OBI-WAN Yes, Master… How do you think this trade viceroy will deal"
with the chancellor’s demands?
QUI-GON These Federation types are cowards. The negotiations will

"DOFINE turns to TC-3, who lets out a squeaky sigh."
7. INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP – CONFERENCE ROOM
QUI-GON and OBI-WAN sit at the large conference table.
OBI-WAN Is it their nature to make us wait this long?
"QUI-GON is thinking. The door to the conference room slides open,"

drink.
QUI-GON No… I sense an unusual amount of fear here for
something as trivial as a trade dispute.

DARTH SIDIOUS You seem more worried about the Jedi than you
"are about me, Dofine. I am amused… Viceroy!"
"NUTE, looking very nervous, steps forward."
"NUTE Yes, My Lord."
DARTH SIDIOUS I don’t want that stunted slime in my sight again…
do you understand?
"NUTE Yes, My Lord."
"NUTE gives DOFINE a fierce look, and DOFINE, terrified, rushes off"

DARTH SIDIOUS I will make it legal.

BATTLESHIP – BRIDGE
The CREW is very nervous as sparks start flying around the bridge
door. QUI-GON and OBI-WAN are on the view screen.
NUTE Close the blast doors!!
15. CONTINUED
"The huge, very thick blast door slams shut, followed by a second"
"door, then a third. There is a hissing sound as the huge doors seal"
shut. QUI-GON tabs the door with his sword. The screen goes black
as a red spot appears in the center of the blast door.
RUNE …They’re still coming through!
"On the door, chunks of molten metal begin to drop away."
NUTE Impossible!! This is impossible!!
RUNE Where are those destroyer droids?! 16. INT. FEDERATION
BATTLESHIP – HALLWAY – OUTSIDE BRIDGE
Ten ugly destroyer WHEEL DROIDS roll down the hallway at full
"speed. Just before they get to the bridge area, they stop and"
transform into their battle configuration. QUI-GON can’t see them but
senses their presence.
QUI-GON Destroyer droids!
"OBI-WAN Offhand, I’d say this mission is past the negotiation stage."
"QUI-GON I know, I know."
"The WHEEL DROIDS, led by P-59, rush the entry area from three"
"hallways, blasting away with their laser guns. They stop firing and"
stand in a semi-circle as the smoke clears. OBI-WAN and QUI-GON
are nowhere to be seen.
P-59 Switch to bio… There they are!
The Jedi materialize at the far end of the hallway and dash through
the doorway that slams shut. 17. INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP –
BRIDGE
"NUTE and RUNE stand on the bridge, watching the view screen as"
the WHEEL DROIDS’ POV speeds to the doorway.
"RUNE We have them on the run, sir… they’re no match for destroyer"
droids.
"TEY HOW Sir, a transmission from the planet."
17. CONTINUED
RUNE It’s Queen Amidala herself.
NUTE At last we’re getting results.
"On the view screen, QUEEN AMIDALA appears in her throne room."
"Wearing her elaborate headdress and robes, she sits, surrounded by"
the GOVERNING COUNCIL and FOUR HANDMAIDENS.
"NUTE Again you come before me, Your highness. The Federation is"
pleased.
"AMIDALA You will not be pleased when you hear what I have to say,"
Viceroy… Your trade boycott has ended.
NUTE smirks at RUNE.
NUTE I was not aware of such a failure.
AMIDALA I have word that the Senate is finally voting on this
blockade of yours.
NUTE I take it you know the outcome. I wonder why they bothered to
vote.
"AMIDALA Enough of this pretense, Viceroy! I’m aware the"
"Chancellor’s Ambassadors are with you now, and that you have been"
commanded to reach a settlement.
NUTE I know nothing about any Ambassadors… you must be
mistaken.
"AMIDALA, surprised at his reaction, studies him carefully."
"AMIDALA Beware, Viceroy… the Federation is going too far this time."
"NUTE Your Majesty, we would never do anything without the"
approval of the Senate. You assume too much. Good day.
"The QUEEN fades off, and the view screen goes black."
"RUNE She’s right, the Senate will never…"
17. CONTINUED (2) NUTE It’s too late now.
RUNE Do you think she suspects an attack?
"NUTE I don’t know, but we must move quickly to disrupt all"
communications down there. 18. INT. NABOO PALACE – THRONE
ROOM
"The QUEEN, EIRTAE, SACHE and her Governor, SIO BIBBLE,"
"stand before a hologram of SENATOR PALPATINE, a thin, kindly"
man.
PALPATINE …How could that be true? I have assurances from the
Chancellor… his Ambassadors did arrive. It must be the… get…
negotiate…
The hologram of PALPATINE sputters and fades away.
"AMIDALA Senator Palpatine, we’re losing you. (turns to"
Panaka) What’s happening?
CAPTAIN PANAKA turns to his SERGEANT
CAPT. PANAKA Check the transmission generators…
BIBBLE A malfunction?
"CAPT. PANAKA It could be the Federation jamming us, Your"
Highness.
BIBBLE A communications disruption can only mean one thing.
Invasion!
"AMIDALA Don’t jump to conclusions, Governor. The Federation"
would not dare to invade.
"CAPT. PANAKA The Senate would revoke their trade permits, and"
they would be finished for good.
AMIDALA We must continue to rely on negotiation.
18. CONTINUED
BIBBLE Negotiation? We’ve lost all communications!… and where
are the Chancellors Ambassadors? How can we negotiate? We must
prepare to defend ourselves.
"CAPT. PANAKA This is a dangerous situation, Your Highness. Our"
security volunteers will be no match against a battle-hardened
Federation army.
AMIDALA I will not condone a course of action that will lead us to
war. 19. INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP – MAIN BAY
QUI-GON and OBI-WAN appear at a large vent in a giant hanger
bay. They are careful not to be seen. Thousands of BATTLE DROIDS
are loading onto landing craft.
QUI-GON Battle droids.
OBI-WAN An invasion army.
QUI-GON It’s an odd play for the Trade Federation. We’ve got to
warn the Naboo and contact Chancellor Valorum.
"OBI-WAN You were right about one thing, Master. The negotiations"
were short. 20. EXT. SPACE LANDING CRAFT – TWILIGHT (FX)
Six landing craft fly in formation toward the surface of the planet
Naboo. 21. EXT. NABOO SWAMP – SHALLOW LAKE – TWILIGHT
Three landing craft slowly descend through the cloud cover of the
"perpetually gray twilight side of the planet. One by one, the"
Federation warships land in the eerie swamp.
OBI-WAN’s head emerges from the mud of a shallow lake. For in the
"background, the activities of the invasion force can be seen in the"
"mist. OBI-WAN takes several deep breaths, then disappears again"
under the muddy swamp. Troop Transports (MTT’s) emerge from the
landing craft.
22. EXT. NABOO SWAMP – TWILIGHT
"QUI-GON runs through the strange landscape, glancing back to see"
"the monstrous troop transports, emerging from the mist. Animals"
begin to run past him in a panic.
"An odd, frog-like Gungan, JAR JAR INKS, squats holding a clam he"
has retrieved from the murky swamp. The shell pops open. JAR
"JAR’s great tongue snaps out and grabs the clam, swallowing it in"
one gulp.
JAR JAR looks up and sees QUI-GON and the other creatures
running like the wind toward him. One of the huge MTT’s bears down
"on the JEDI like a charging locomotive. JAR JAR stands transfixed,"
still holding the clam shell in one hand.
"JAR JAR Oh, noooooooooo!"
JAR JAR drops the shell and grabs onto QUI-GON as he passes.
The JEDI is caught by surprise.
"JAR JAR Hey, hep me! Hep me!!"
QUI-GON Let go!
The machine is about to crush them as QUI-GON drags JAR JAR
"behind him. Just as the transport is about to hit them, QUI-GON"
"drops, and JAR JAR goes splat into the mud with him. The transport"
races overhead.
QUI-GON and JAR JAR pull themselves out of the mud. They stand
watching the war machine disappear into the mist. JAR JAR grabs
QUI-GON and hugs him.
"JAR JAR Oyi, mooie-mooie! I luv yous!"
The frog-like creature kisses the JEDI.
QUI-GON Are you brainless? You almost got us killed!
JAR JAR I spake.
QUI-GON The ability to speak does not make you intelligent. Now get
outta here!
"QUI-GON starts to move off, and JAR JAR follows."
JAR JAR No… .no! Mesa stay… Mesa yous humble servaunt.
22. CONTINUED
QUI-GON That wont be necessary.
"JAR JAR Oh boot tis! Tis demunded byda guds. Tis a live deb-ett, tis."
Mesa culled Jaja Binkss.
"In the distance, two STAPS burst out of the mist at high speed,"
chasing OBI-WAN.
QUI-GON I have no time for this now…
JAR JAR Say what?
The two STAPS barrel down on OBI-WAN.
"JAR JAR Oh, nooooo! Weesa ganna…"
QUI-GON throws JAR JAR into the mud.
QUI-GON Stay down!
His head pops up.
JAR JAR: …dieeee!
The two troops fire laser bolts at OBI-WAN. QUI-GON deflects the
"bolts back, and the STAPS blow up. One-two. OBI-WAN is exhausted"
"and tries to catch his breath. OBI-WAN Sorry, Master, the water fried"
my weapon.
OBI-WAN pulls out his burnt laser sword handle. QUI-GON inspects
"it, as JAR JAR pulls himself out of the mud."
"QUI-GON You forgot to turn your power off again, didn’t you?"
OBI-WAN nods sheepishly.
"QUI-GON It won’t take long to recharge, but this is a lesson I hope"
"you’ve learned, my young Padawan."
"OBI-WAN Yes, Master."
22. CONTINUED (2)
"JAR JAR Yousa sav-ed my again, hey?"
OBI-WAN What’s this?
"QUI-GON A local. Let’s go, before more of those droids show up."
JAR JAR Mure? Mure did you spake??!?
OBI-WAN and QUI-GON start to run. JAR JAR tries to keep up.
"JAR JAR Ex-squeeze-me, but da moto grande safe place would be"
Otoh Gunga. Tis where I grew up… Tis safe city.
They all stop.
QUI-GON A city! (Jar Jar nods his head) Can you take us there?
"JAR JAR Ahhh, will… on second taut… no, not willy."
QUI-GON No??!
"JAR JAR Iss embarrissing, boot… My afrai my’ve bean banished. My"
forgoten der Bosses would do terrible tings to my. Terrible tings if my
goen back dare.
A PULSATING SOUND is heard in the distance.
QUI-GON You hear that?
JAR JAR shakes his head yes.
QUI-GON That’s the sound of a thousand terrible things heading this
way…
"OBI-WAN When they find us, they will crush us, grind us into little"
"pieces, then blast us into oblivion!"
22. CONTINUED
JAR JAR Oh! Yousa point is well seen. Dis way! Hurry!
JAR JAR turns and runs into the swamp. 23. EXT. NABOO EDGE
OF SWAMP/GRASS PLAINS – SUNRISE (FX)
The droid invasion force moves out of the swamp and onto a grassy
"plain. OOM-9, in his tank, looks out over the vast ARMY marching"
across the rolling hills. A small hologram of RUNE and NUTE stands
on the tank.
RUNE …and there is no trace of the Jedi. They may have gotten onto
one of your landing craft.
"OOM-9 If they are down here, sir, we’ll find them. We are moving out"
of the swamp and are marching on the city of Oxon. There is no
resistance.
NUTE Excellent. 24. EXT. NABOO SWAMP LAKE – TWILIGHT
"QUI-GON, OBI-WAN and JAR JAR run into a murky lake and stop as"
JAR JAR tries to catch his breath. The TRANSPORTS ARE HEARD
in the distance.
QUI-GON Much farther?
"JAR JAR Wesa goen underwater, okeyday?"
QUI-GON and OBI-WAN pull out small capsule from their utility belts
that turn into breathing masks.
JAR JAR My warning yous. Gungans no liken outlaunders. Don’t
expict a wern welcome.
"OBI-WAN Don’t worry, this has not been our day for warm welcomes."
"JAR JAR jumps, does a double somersault with a twist, and dives"
into the water.
"Breath masks on, QUI-GON and OBI-WAN wade in after him. 25."
EXT. NABOO LAKE – UNDERWATER
"QUI-GON and OBI-WAN swim behind JAR JAR, who is very much at"
home in the water. Down they swim into murky depths. In the
"distance the glow of Otoh Gunga, an underwater city made up of"
"large bubbles, becomes more distinct."
GUNGANS in the square scatter when they see the strange JEDI.
"They approach the strange, art nouveau habitat. JAR JAR swims"
"magically through one of the bubble membranes, which seals behind"
him. OBI-WAN and QUI-GON follow. 26. INT. OTOH GUNGA – CITY
SQUARE
Four GUARDS armed with long electro-poles ride two-legged
"KAADUS into the square. The GUARDS, led by CAPTAIN TARPALS,"
point their lethal poles at the dripping trio.
"JAR JAR Heyo-dalee, Cap’n Tarpals, Mesa back!"
"CAPT. TARPALS Noah gain, Jar jar. Yousa goen tada Bosses."
Yousa in big dudu this time.
CAPT. TARPALS gives JAR JAR a slight zap with his power pole.
"JAR JAR jumps and moves off, followed by the two JEDI."
JAR JAR How wude. 27. INT. OTOH GUNGA – HIGH TOWER
BOARD ROOM
"The Bosses’ Board Room has bubble walls, with small lighted fish"
swimming around outside like moving stars. A long circular judge’s
bench filled with GUNGAN OFFICIALS dominates the room. OBIWAN
"and QUI-GON stand facing BOSS NASS, who sits on a bench"
higher than the others.
BOSS NASS …Yousa cannot bees hair. Dis army of Mackineeks up

QUI-GON That droid army is about to attack the Naboo. We must
warn them.
BOSS NASS Wesa no like da Naboo! Un dey no like uss-ens. Da

"OBI-WAN After those droids take control of the surface, they will"

QUI-GON Thank you for your help. We go in peace.
QUI-GON and OBI-WAN turn to leave.
"OBI-WAN Master, what’s a bongo?"
"QUI-GON A transport, I hope."
"The JEDI notice JAR JAR in chains to one side, waiting to hear his"
verdict. QUI-GON stops. JAR JAR gives him a forlorn look.
JAR JAR Daza setten yous up. Goen through da planet core is bad
bombin!!
"QUI-GON Thank you, my friend."
JAR JAR Ahhh… any hep hair would be hot.
JAR JAR’s soulful look is counterpointed by a sheepish grin.
27. CONTINUED (2)
"OBI-WAN We don’t have time, Master."
QUI-GON Time spent here may help us. Jar Jar here may be of use
to us…
OBI-WAN I sense a loss of focus.
"QUI-GON Be mindful, my young Padawan! Your sensitivity to the"
living Force is not your strength!
OBI-WAN is embarrassed. QUI-GON walks back to BOSS NASS.
QUI-GON What is to become of Jar jar Binks here?
BOSS NASS Binkss brokeen the nocombackie law. Hisen to be
pune-ished.
QUI-GON He has been a great help to us. I hope the punishment will
not be too severe.
BOSS NASS Pounded unto death.
JAR JAR (grimacing) Oooooh… Ouch!
OBI-WAN looks concerned. QUI-GON is thinking.
QUI-GON We need a navigator to get us through the planet’s core. I
have saved Jar Jar Binks’ life. He owes me what you call a “life debt.”
BOSS NASS Binks. Yousa havena liveplay with thisen hisen?
JAR JAR nods and joins the JEDI. QUI-GON waves his hand.
QUI-GON Your gods demand that his life belongs to me now.
"BOSS NASS Hisen live tis yos, outlauder. Begone wit him."
"JAR JAR Count mesa outta dis! Better dead here, den deader in da"

leaving the glow of the settlement in the distance.
INT. SUB COCKPIT – UNDERWATER
"OBI-WAN in the co-pilots seat, JAR JAR guides the craft."
JAR JAR Dis is nusen.
"OBI-WAN Master, why do you keep dragging these pathetic life forms"
"along with us?… Here, take over."
"JAR JAR Hey, ho? Where wesa goen??"
QUI-GON You’re the navigator.
JAR JAR Yo dreamen mesa hopen…
"QUI-GON Just relax, the Force will guide us…"
"JAR JAR Ooooh, maxibig… “da Force”… Wellen, dat smells"
stinkowiff.
JAR JAR veers the craft to the left and turns the lights on. The coral
"vistas are grand, fantastic, and wondrous."
"OBI-WAN Why were you banished, Jar jar?"
"JAR JAR Tis a long tale, buta small part wawdabe mesa… ooooh…"
aaaa… clumsy.
OBI-WAN They banished you because you’re clumsy?
"As the little sub glides into the planet core, a large dark shape begins"
to follow.
JAR JAR Mesa cause-ed mabee one or duey lettal bitty axadentes…
"yud-say boom da gasser, un crash Der Bosses heyblibber… den"

"Suddenly there is a loud CRASH, and the little craft lurches to one"
"side. QUI-GON looks around and sees a huge, luminous OPEE SEA"
KILLER has hooked them with its long gooey tongue.
QUI-GON Full speed ahead.
"Instead of full ahead, JAR JAR jams the controls into reverse. The"
sub flies into the mouth of the creature.
JAR JAR Oooops.
OBI-WAN Give me the controls.
OBI-WAN takes over the controls and the OPEE SEA KILLER
instantly releases the sub from its mouth.
JAR JAR Wesa free!
"As the sub zooms away they see a larger set of jaws, munching on"
the hapless KILLER. The jaws belong to the incredible SANDO
AQUA MONSTER. The lights on the tiny sub begin to flicker as they
cruise deeper into the gloom.
QUI-GON There’s always a bigger fish.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP – BRIDGE
NUTE and RUNE stand before a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS.
"NUTE The invasion is on schedule, My Lord."
DARTH SIDIOUS Good. I have the Senate bogged down in
"procedures. By the time this incident comes up for a vote, they will"
have no choice but to accept your control of the system.
NUTE The Queen has great faith the Senate will side with her.
DARTH SIDIOUS Queen Amidala is young and naive. You will find
"controlling her will not be difficult. You have done well, Viceroy."
"NUTE Thank you, My Lord."
DARTH SIDIOUS fades away.
RUNE You didn’t tell him about the missing Jedi?
"NUTE No need to report that to him, until we have something to"
report.
INT. SUB COCKPIT – UNDERWATER
"Sparks are flying, and water is leaking into the cabin. The sound of"
the power drive drops.
OBI-WAN … we’re losing power.
OBI-WAN is working with the sparking wires. JAR JAR panics.
QUI-GON Stay calm. We’re not in trouble yet.
"JAR JAR What yet? Monstairs out dare! Leak’n in here, all’n sink’n,"
and nooooo power! You nutsen! WHEN YOUSA TINK WESA IN
TROUBLE?!!!?
OBI-WAN Power’s back.
"The lights flicker on, revealing an ugly COLO CLAW FISH right in"
front of them.
JAR JAR Monstairs back!
The large COLO CLAW FISH is surprised and rears back. The sub
turns around and speeds away.
JAR JAR (cont’d) Wesa in trouble now??
QUI-GON Relax.
QUI-GON puts his hand on JAR JAR’s shoulder. JAR JAR relaxes
into a coma.
OBI-WAN You overdid it.
The COLO CLAW FISH leaps after the fleeing sub as it shoots out of
the tunnel and into the waiting jaws of the SANDO AQUA MONSTER.
OBI-WAN (cont’d) This is not good!
JAR JAR regains consciousness.
JAR JAR Wesa dead yet?? Oie Boie!
"JAR JAR’s eyes bulge, and he faints again. The sub narrowly avoids"
the deadly teeth of the AQUA MONSTER. The COLO CLAW FISH
chasing them isn’t so lucky. It is munched in half by the larger
predator. The little sub slips away.
QUI-GON Head for that outcropping.
EXT. THEED – MAIN ROAD INTO THEED – DAY (FX)
The long columns of the DROID ARMY move down the main road
"leading to Theed, the Naboo capital."

"The little sub continue to propel itself toward the surface, which is"
brightly lit.
JAR JAR Wesa dude it!
EXT. THEED – ESTUARY – DAY
Paradise. Billowing clouds frame a romantic body of water. There is a
"LOUD RUSH OF BUBBLES, and a small sub bobs to the surface."
The current in the estuary begins to pull the sub backward into a fast
moving river. OBI-WAN switches off the two remaining bubble
canopies. QUI-GON stands up to look around. JAR JAR lets out a
sigh of relief.
JAR JAR Wesa safe now.
QUI-GON Get this thing started.
JAR JAR Dissen berry good. Hey?
OBI-WAN What is it?
JAR JAR looks back to where they’re drifting. He sees they are
headed for a huge waterfall.
JAR JAR What!!?? Oie boie!
OBI-WAN tries to start the engine. The long props behind the sub
"slowly begin to rotate. OBI-WAN struggles until finally, a few feet"
"short of the waterfall, the sub starts and is able to generate enough"
power to stop drifting backward in the powerful current. The sub
"slowly moves forward. In the background, QUI-GON takes a cable"
out of his belt. The engine coughs and dies. They start drifting
backward again. JAR JAR panics.
"JAR JAR (cont’d) Iyiiyi, wesa die’n here, hey!"
"QUI-GON shoots the thin cable, and it wraps itself around a railing on"
"the shore. The sub pulls the cable taut, and the little craft hangs"
precariously over the edge of the waterfall.
QUI-GON Come on…
OBI-WAN climbs out of the sub and pulls himself along the cable.
QUI-GON starts in after him.
"QUI-GON (cont’d) Come on, Jar jar."
JAR JAR No! Too scary!
OBI-WAN Get up here!
JAR JAR No a mighty no!
JAR JAR looks back and sees he is hanging over the waterfall.
JAR JAR (cont’d) Oie boie… mesa comen. Mesa comen!
JAR JAR starts to climb out of the sub. OBI-WAN is on shore and
helps to pull QUI-GON out of the water.
OBI-WAN That was close.
BATTLE DROID 3B3: (O.S) Drop your weapons!
The TWO JEDI turn around to see a BATTLE DROID standing in
front of them. JAR JAR climbs up on shore between the JEDI.
BATTLE DROID 3B3 I said drop your weapons
"QUI-GON ignites his laser sword, and in a brief flash, the DROID is"
cut down by the JEDI. A stray laser bolt hits the cable and the sub
"breaks lose, crashing down the waterfall. The JEDI move on. JAR"
JAR reluctantly follows and looks back at the mess.
JAR JAR Whoa!!!

TWENTY DROIDS. CAPTAIN PANAKA and FOUR NABOO
GUARDS are also held at gunpoint. NUTE and RUNE stand in the
middle of the room.
BIBBLE … how will you explain this invasion to the Senate?
NUTE The Naboo and the Federation will forge a treaty that will
legitimize our occupation here. I’ve been assured it will be ratified by
the Senate.
AMIDALA I will not co-operate.
"NUTE Now, now, your Highness. You are not going to like what we"
"have in store for your people. In time, their suffering will persuade you"
to see our point of view. Commander. (OOM-9 steps
forward) Process them.
"OOM-9 Yes, sir! (turns to his sergeant) Take them to Camp Four."
The SERGEANT marches the GROUP out of the throne room.
EXT. PALACE – PLAZA – DAY
"QUEEN AMIDALA, PADME, EIRTA, YANE, RABE, SACHE,"
"CAPTAIN PANAKA, SIO BIBBLE, and FOUR GUARDS are led out of"
the palace by ten BATTLE DROIDS. The plaza is filled with tanks and
"BATTLE DROIDS, which they pass on their way to the detention"
"camp. Unbeknownst to them, QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, and JAR JAR"
sneak across on a walkway above the plaza and jump from a balcony
to begin an attack to rescue the QUEEN.
FOUR BATTLE DROIDS are instantly cut down. MORE DROIDS
move forward and are also cut down by the JEDIS’ flashing
lightsabres until there is only the DROID SERGEANT left. The
SERGEANT starts to run but is pulled back to QUI-GON by the
"Force, until finally he is dispatched by the JEDI."
JAR JAR Yousa guys bombad!
QUEEN AMIDALA and the OTHERS are amazed. JAR JAR is getting
used to this. They move between two buildings.
"QUI-GON Your Highness, we are the Ambassadors, for the Supreme"
Chancellor.
"BIBBLE Your negotiations seem to have failed, Ambassador."
"QUI-GON The negotiations never took place. Your Highness, we"
must make contact with the republic.
CAPTAIN PANAKA steps forward.
CAPT. PANAKA They’ve knocked out all our communications.
QUI-GON Do you have transports?
CAPT. PANAKA In the main hanger. This way.
THEY disappear down an alleyway as the ALARMS are sounded
INT. CENTRAL HANGER – HALLWAY – DAY
CAPTAIN PANAKA cracks open a side door to the central hanger.
"QUI-GON looks in over his shoulder. OBI-WAN, JAR JAR, and the"
rest of the group are behind him. They see several Naboo spacecraft
guarded by about FIFTY BATTLE DROIDS. ALARMS can be heard
in the distance.
CAPT. PANAKA There are too many of them.
"QUI-GON That won’t be a problem. (to Amidala) Your Highness,"
"under the circumstances, I suggest you come to Coruscant with us."
"AMIDALA Thank you, Ambassador, but my place is here with my"
people.
QUI-GON They will kill you if you stay.
BIBBLE They wouldn’t dare.
CAPT. PANAKA They need her to sign a treaty to make this invasion
of theirs legal. They can’t afford to kill her.
QUI-GON The situation here is not what it seems. There is something
"else behind all this, Your Highness. There is no logic in the"
Federation’s move here. My feelings tell me they will destroy you.
"BIBBLE Please, Your Highness, reconsider. Our only hope is for the"
Senate to side with us… Senator Palpatine will need your help.
"CAPT. PANAKA Getting past their blockade is impossible, Your"
Highness. Any attempt to escape will be dangerous.
"BIBBLE Your Highness, I will stay here and do what I can… They will"
have to retain the Council of Governors in order to maintain control.
But you must leave…
The QUEEN turns to PADME and EIRTAE.
AMIDALA Either choice presents a great risk… to all of us…
"PADME We are brave, Your Highness."
"QUI-GON If you are to leave, Your Highness, it must be now."
"AMIDALA Then, I will plead our case before the Senate. (to Bibble)"
"Be careful, Governor."

CAPT. PANAKA We need to free those pilots.
"CAPTAIN PANAKA points to TWENTY GUARDS, GROUND CREW,"
and PILOTS held in a corner by SIX BATTLE DROIDS.
OBI-WAN I’ll take care of that.
OBI-WAN heads toward the group of captured pilots.
"QUI-GON and the QUEEN, CAPTAIN PANAKA, JAR JAR, and the"
rest Of the GROUP approach the GUARDS at the ramp of the Naboo
craft.
GUARD DROID Where are you going?
"QUI-GON I’m Ambassador for the Supreme Chancellor, and I’m"
taking those people to Coruscant.
DROID GUARD You’re under arrest!
"The DROID GUARD draws his weapon, but before any of the"
"DROIDS can fire, they are cut down. OTHER GUARDS run to their"
aid. OBI-WAN attacks the GUARDS around the PILOTS. QUI-GON
"stands, fighting off DROIDS as the OTHERS rush on board the"
"spacecraft. OBI-WAN, the FREED PILOTS (including RIC OLIE),"
GUARDS and GROUND CREW MEMBERS rush on board the ship.
The OTHER PILOTS and GUARDS race to SIO BIBBLE. After

OBI-WAN closes the door. JAR JAR looks around and sees a long
"row of five short, dome-topped ASTRO DROIDS (R-2 units). The all"
"look alike, except for their paint color, and they all seem to be shut"
down.
"JAR JAR Ello, boyos. (no response) Disa wanna longo trip… hey?"
"JAR JAR taps a bright red R-2 UNIT on the head, and its head pops"
up a bit. He lets out a gasp as he lifts the head.
JAR JAR (Cont’d) Tis opens?… Oooops!
Many springs and things come flying out. JAR JAR quickly closes it
"again, very embarrassed."
JAR JAR (Cont’d) Yoi! Just yoken!
EXT. SPACE BATTLE (FX)
"The Naboo spacecraft, surrounded by EXPLOSIONS, heads even"
closer to the massive Federation battleships.
INT. NABOO SPACECRAT – COCKPIT
"RIC OLIE There’s the blockade, hang on."
ALARM SOUNDS fill the cockpit as OBI-WAN enters.
RIC OLIE (Cont’d) The shield generator’s been hit. Our deflector
shields can’t withstand this. Power down… Hopefully the repair droids
can fix it.
INT. NABOO SPACECRACT – DROID HOLD (FX)
"The lights go on, and all the DROIDS are activated. DROIDS rush to"
"an exterior air lock, except for the red one, who runs into a wall. JAR"
"JAR holds on for dear life. One LITTLE BLUE ASTRO DROID, who is"
"especially dedicated, lets out a loud screech as he passes JAR JAR,"
causing the Gungan to jump. The LITTLE DROID enters an air lock
and is ejected onto the exterior of the ship.
CAPT. PANAKA Stay on course!
QUI-GON Do you have a cloaking device?
"CAPT. PANAKA No, this is not a warship… we have no"
weapons. We’re a non-violent people… that is why the Federation
was brave enough to attack us.
RIC OLIE We won’t make it. The shields are gone.
EXT. NABOO SPACECRAFT – FEDERATION BATTLESHIP –
SPACE (FX)
The DROIDS pop onto the exterior of the Naboo spacecraft; the ship
"races across the surface of the massive Federation battleship, as its"
guns blast TWO ASTRO DROIDS.
OBI-WAN We’re losing droids fast.
"CAPT. PANAKA If they can’t get those shield generators fixed, we"
will be sitting ducks.
RIC OLIE The shields are gone.
EXT. NABOO SPACECRAFT – ENGINES – SPACE (FX)
The Federation battleship blows away ONE MORE ASTRO DROID.
"The BLUE DROID connects some wires, causing sparks to fly."
RIC OLIE Powers back! That little droid did it. He bypassed the main
"power drive. Deflector shield up, at maximum."
The lone BLUE DROID finishes his repairs and goes back into the
ship. The Naboo spacecraft races away from the Federation
battleship.
RIC OLIE There’s not enough power to get us to Coruscant… the
hyperdrive is leaking.
QUI-GON We’ll have to land somewhere to refuel and repair the ship.
QUI-GON studies a star chart on a monitor.
"OBI-WAN Here, Master. Tatooine… It’s small, out of the way, poor…"
The Trade Federation has no presence there.
CAPT. PANAKA How can you be sure?
QUI-GON It’s controlled by the Hutts…
CAPT. PANAKA The Hutts??
OBI-WAN It’s risky… but there’s no alternative.
CAPT. PANAKA You can’t take Her Royal Highness there! The Hutts
are gangsters… If they discovered her…
QUI-GON … It would be no different than if we landed on a system
"controlled by the Federation… except the Hutts aren’t looking for her,"
which gives us an advantage.
CPATAIN PANAKA takes a deep breath in frustration.
EXT. SPACE – NABOO SPACECRAFT (FX)
The Naboo spacecraft races away.
INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP – CONFERENCE ROOM
NUTE and RUNE sit around a conference table with a hologram of
DARTH SIDIOUS.
NUTE We control all the cities in the North and are searching for any
other settlements…
"DARTH SIDIOUS Destroy all high-ranking officials, Viceroy…"
"slowly… quietly. And Queen Amidala, has she signed the treaty?"
"NUTE She has disappeared, My Lord. One Naboo cruiser got pat the"
blockade.
"DARTH SIDIOUS Viceroy, find her! I want that treaty signed."
"NUTE My Lord, it’s impossible to locate the ship. It’s out of our range."
DARTH SIDIOUS … not for a Sith…
A second SITH LORD appears behind DARTH SIDIOUS.
"DARTH SIDIOUS (Cont’d) … Viceroy, this is my apprentice. Lord"
Maul. He will find your lost ship.
"NUTE Yes, My Lord. The hologram fades off."
NUTE (Cont’d) This is getting out of hand… now there are two of
them.
RUNE We should not have made this bargain. What will happen
when the Jedi become aware of these Sith Lords?
INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT – QUEENS CHAMBERS
"QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, CAPTAIN PANAKA, and the LITTLE BLUE"
DROID stand before QUEEN AMIDALA and her THREE
"HANDMAIDENS, PADME, EIRTAE and RABE."
CAPT. PANAKA … An extremely well put together little droid. Without
"a doubt, it saved the ship, as well as our lives."
AMIDALA It is to be commended… what is its number?
The LITTLE BLUE DROID lets out a series of bleeps. CAPTAIN
PANAKA leans over and scrapes some dirt off of the side of the
DROID and read the number:
"CAPT. PANAKA R2-D2, Your Highness."
"AMIDALA Thank you, Artoo Detoo. You have proven to be very"
loyal… Padme!
PADME bows before the QUEEN.
AMIDALA (Cont’d) Clean this droid up the best you can. It deserves
"our gratitude… (to Panaka) Continue, Captain."
CAPTAIN PANAKA looks nervously to OBI-WAN and QUI-GON.
"QUI-GON Your Highness, we are heading for a remote planet called"
Tatooine. It is a system far beyond the reach of the Trade Federation.
"There we will be able to make needed repairs, then travel on to"
Coruscant.
"CAPTAIN PANAKA Your Highness, Tatooine is very dangerous. It’s"
controlled by an alliance of gangs called the Hutts. I do not agree with
the Jedi on this.
"QUI-GON You must trust my judgement, Your Highness."
AMIDALA and PADME exchange looks. PADME moves next to the
DROID.
INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT – MAIN AREA
"PADME sits in the Main Area, cleaning R2-D2, the brave little Astro"
Droid. JAR JAR pops out of an open door.
JAR JAR Hidoe!
Both PADME and ARTOO jump and let out a little SCREAM. The
Gungan is embarrassed that he frightened them.
"JAR JAR (Cont’d) Sorry, nomeanen to scare yousa."
PADME That’s all right.
JAR JAR I scovered oily back dare. Needen it?
PADME Thank you. This little guy is quite a mess.
JAR JAR hands PADME the oil can.
JAR JAR Mesa Ja Ja Binksss…
"PADME I’m Padme, I attend Her Highness, You’re a Gungan, aren’t"
you? (Jar Jar nods) How did you end up here with us?

shrugs)… getten berry berry skeered.
ARTOO BEEPS a sympathetic beep.
INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT – COCKPIT
"OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, and CAPTAIN PANAKA watch over RIC"
OLIE’S shoulder. A large yellow planet appears directly ahead. RIC
OLIE searches his scopes.
OBI-WAN That’s it. Tatooine.
"RIC OLIE There’s a settlement… a spaceport, looks like."
QUI-GON Land near the outskirts. We don’t want to attract any
attention.
EXT. TATOOINE – SPACE (FX)
The ship heads toward the planet of Tatooine.
EXT. TATOOINE – DESERT – NABOO SPACECRAFT – DAY (FX)
The Naboo spacecraft lands in the desert in a swirl of dust. The
spaceport of Mos Espa is seen in the distance.
EXT. NABOO SPACECRAFT – MAIN AREA
OBI-WAN is hoisting the hyperdrive out of a floor panel. JAR JAR
rushes up to him and falls to his knees.
"JAR JAR Obi-Wan, sire, pleeese, no mesa go!"
"OBI-WAN Sorry, Qui-Gon’s right. You’ll make things less obvious."
JAR JAR walks back to ARTOO in the hallway as QUI-GON (dressed
as a farmer) enters the main area.
OBI-WAN (Cont’d) The Hyperdrive generator is gone. We will need a
new one.
QUI-GON moves closer to OBI-WAN and speaks quietly to him.
QUI-GON Don’t let them send ant transmissions. Be wary… I sense a
disturbance in the Force.
"OBI-WAN I fell it also, Master."
QUI-GON goes into the hallway to meet up with ARTOO and JAR
JAR. They head to the exit ramp.
EXT. TATOOINE – DESERT – SPACESHIP – DAY
They start their trek across the desert toward the city of Mos Espa. In
"the distance, a strange looking caravan makes its way toward the"
spaceport.
JAR JAR Dis sun doen murder tada skin.
"From the spaceship, CAPTAIN PANAKA and PADME run toward"
them.
CAPT. PANAKA Wait!
QUI-GON stops as they catch up. PADME is dresses in rough
peasant’s garb.
CAPT. PANAKA (Cont’d) Her Highness commands you to take her
handmaiden with you. She wishes for her to observe the local…
"QUI-GON No more commands from Her Highness today, Captain."
This spaceport is not going to be pleasant…
CAPT. PANAKA The Queen wishes it. She is curious about this
planet.
PADME I’ve been trained in defense… I can take care of myself.
CAPT. PANAKA Don’t make me go back and tell her you refuse.
QUI-GON I don’t have time to argue. But this is not a good idea. Stay
close to me.
He gives PADME a stern look.
EXT. MOS ESPA – STREET – DAY
The little GROUP walks down the main street of Mos Espa. They
pass dangerous looking citizens of all types. PADME looks around in
awe at this exotic environment.
"QUI-GON … moisture farms for the most part, but also a few"
indigenous tribes and scavengers. The few spaceports like this one
are havens for those who do not wish to be found…
PADME … like us.
"JAR JAR is in a constant state of panic. ARTOO whistles along, with"
perfect confidence.
JAR JAR Dissen berry berry bad. (steps in ooze) Ooooh… icky…
icky… goo.
EXT. MOS ESPA – JUNK DEALER PLAZA – DAY
The GROUP comes to a little plaza surrounded by several junk
spaceship dealers.
QUI-GON We’ll try one of the smaller dealers.
They head for a little junk shop that has a huge pile of broken
spaceships stacked up behind it.
INT. WATTO’S JUNK SHOP – DAY
"QUI-GON, JAR JAR, PADME, and ARTOO enter the dingy junk shop"
"and are greeted by WATTO, a pudgy blue alien who flies on short"
little wings like a hummingbird.
WATTO (subtitled) Hi chuba da naga? (What do you want?)
QUI-GON I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian.
"WATTO Ah yes, ah yes. Nubian. We have lots of that. What kinda"
"junk? (subtitled) Peedenkel! Naba dee unko (Boy, get in here! Now!)"
QUI-GON My droid here has a readout of what I need.
"A disheveled boy, ANAKIN SKYWALKER, runs in from the junk yard."
"He is about nine years old, very dirty, and dressed in rags. WATTO"
"raises a hand, and ANAKIN flinches."
WATTO (subtitled) Coona tee-tocky malia? (What took you so long?)
ANAKIN (subtitled) Mel tassa cho-passa… (I was cleaning the bin like
you… )
WATTO (subtitled) Chut-Chut! Ganda doe wallya. (Never mind!
Watch the store) Me dwana no bata. (I’ve got some selling to do
"here.) (to Qui-Gon) Soooo, let me take- a thee out back. Ni you’ll find"
what you need.
"ARTOO and QUI-GON follow WATTO toward the junk yard, leaving"
JAR JAR with PADME and the young boy ANAKIN. JAR JAR picks
"up a gizmo, trying to figure out its purpose. QUI-GON takes the part"
out of his hand and puts it back.
QUI-GON Don’t touch anything.
JAR JAR makes a rude face to QUI-GON’s back and sticks out his
"long tongue. ANAKIN sits on the counter, pretending to clean a part,"
staring at PADME. She is the most beautiful creature he has ever
"seen in his life. PADME is a little embarrassed by his stare, but she"
"musters up an amused smile. Finally, he gets the courage to speak."
ANAKIN Are you an angel?
PADME What?
ANAKIN An angel. I’ve heard the deep space pilots talk about them.
They live on the Moons of Iego I think. They are the most beautiful
"creatures in the universe. They are good and kind, and so pretty they"
make even the most hardened spice pirate cry.
"PADME looks at him, not knowing what to say."
PADME I’ve never heard of angels.
ANAKIN You must be one… maybe you just don’t know it.
PADME You’re a funny little boy. How do you know so much?
"ANAKIN Since I was very little, three, I think. My Mom and I were sold"
"to Gardulla the Hutt, but she lost us, betting on the Podraces, to"
"Watto, who’s a lot better master than Gardulla, I think."
PADME You’re… a slave?
ANAKIN looks at PADME defiantly.
ANAKIN I am a person! My name is Anakin.
PADME I’m sorry. I don’t fully understand. (looking around) This is a
strange world to me.
ANAKIN studies her intently.
ANAKIN You are a strange girl to me.
"JAR JAR pushes the nose on what appears to be a LITTLE DROID,"
"and it instantly comes to life, grows legs and arms, and starts"
"marching around, knocking over everything. JAR JAR hold on but"
can’t stop it.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) Hit the nose!
"JAR JAR hits the nose, and the DROID collapses back into its"
original state. ANAKIN and PADME laugh. ANAKIN watches PADME
straighten her hair.
EXT. WATTO’S JUNK YARD – BEHIND SHOP – DAY
WATTO reads a small portable monitor he is holding. He stands
before a hyperdrive.
"WATTO … Here it is… a T-14 hyperdrive generator!! Thee in luck,"
I’m the only one hereabouts who has one… but thee might as well
"buy a new ship. It would be cheaper, I think… Sying of which, how’s"
thee going to pay for all this?
"QUI-GON I have 20,000 Republic dataries."
WATTO Republic credits?!? Republic credits are no good out here. I
need something more real…
QUI-GON I don’t have anything else. (raising his hand) But credits
will do fine.
WATTO No they won’ta.
"QUI-GON, using his mind power, waves his hand again."
QUI-GON Credits will do fine.
"WATTO No, they won’ta. What you think you’re some kinda Jedi,"
waving your hand around like that? I’m a Toydarian. Mind tricks
"don’ta work on me-only money. No money, no parts! No deal! And no"
"one else has a T-14 hyperdrive, I promise you that."
INT. WATTO’S JUNK SHOP – DAY
"JAR JAR pulls a part out of a stack of parts to inspect it, and they all"
"come tumbling down. He struggles to catch them, only to knock more"
down. ANAKIN and PADME are oblivious.
ANAKIN … wouldn’t have lasted long if I weren’t so good at fixing
things. I’m making my own droid…
"QUI-GON hurries into the shop, followed by ARTOO."
QUI-GON We’re leaving.
JAR JAR follows QUI-GON. PADME gives ANAKIN a loving look.
PADME I’m glad I met you… ah…
ANAKIN … Anakin.
PADME Anakin.
ANAKIN Anakin Skywalker.
PADME Padme Naberrie.
"PADME turns, and ANAKIN looks sad as he watches her leave."
ANAKIN I’m glad I met you too.
"WATTO enters the junk yard, shaking his head."
WATTO (subtitled) Ootmians! Tinka me chasa hopoe ma booty na
"nolia. (Outlanders! They think because we live so far from the center,"
we don’t know nothing.)
ANAKIN (subtitled) La lova num botaffa. (They seemed nice to me.)
WATTO (subtitled) Fweepa niaga. Tolpa da bunky dunko. (Clean the
"racks, then you can go home.)"
ANAKIN lets out a “yipee” and runs out the back.
EXT. MOS ESPA – STREET – ALCOVE – DAY
"QUI-GON, ARTOO, JAR JAR, and PADME have found a quiet spot"
between two buildings. The busy street beyond is filled with
"dangerous looking creatures. QUI-GON is talking on his com-link,"
while JAR JAR nervously watches the street. OBI-WAN is in the main
hold of the Naboo craft.
"QUI-GON … Obi-Wan, you’re sure there isn’t anything of value left on"
board?
"OBI-WAN (V.O) A few containers of supplies, the Queen’s wardrobe,"
maybe. Not enough for you to barter with. Not in the amounts you’re
talking about.
QUI-GON All right. Another solution will present itself. I’ll check back.
QUI-GON puts his comlink away and starts out into the main street.
JAR JAR grabs his arm.
JAR JAR Noah gain… da beings hereabouts cawazy. Wesa be
robbed un crunched.
"QUI-GON Not likely. We have nothing of value, that’s our problem."
EXT. MOS ESPA – STREET – MARKET – DAY
"QUI-GON, PADME, JAR JAR, and ARTOO move out into the street."
JAR JAR is walking behind the others. They walk by an outdoor cafe
"filled with a rough gang of aliens, one of which is especially ugly,"
"SEBULBA, a spider-like creature. JAR JAR stops for a moment in"
front of a stall selling dead frogs hanging on a wire. He looks around
"to see if anyone is looking, then sticks out his tongue, and gets hold"
"of one, pulling it into his mouth. Unfortunately, the frog is tied tightly to"
the wire. The vendor suddenly appears.
"VENDOR Hey, that will be seven truguts!!"
"JAR JAR opens his mouth in surprise, and the frog snaps away,"
"ricochets around the market, and lands in Sebulba’s soup, splashing"
"him. As JAR JAR moves away from the VENDOR, SEBULBA jumps"
up on the table and grabs the hapless Gungan.
SEBULBA (subtitled) Chuba!! (You!!)
"JAR JAR Who, mesa??"
SEBULBA (subtitled) Ni chuba na?? (Is this yours??)
SEBULBA holds the frog up to the Gungan threateningly. SEVERAL
OTHER CREATURES start to gather. SEBULBA shoves JAR JAR to
the ground. The Gungan desperately tries to scramble to safety.
JAR JAR (to himself) Why mesa always da one??
ANAKIN (V.O) Because you’re afraid.
JAR JAR turns to see ANAKIN pushing his way next to him. The boy
stands up to SEBULBA in a very self-assured way.
"ANAKIN (subtitled) Chess ko, Sebulba… Coo wolpa tooney"
"rana. (Careful, Sebulba… This one’s very connected.)"
SEBULBA stops his assault on JAR JAR and turns to ANAKIN.
"SEBULBA (subtitled) Tooney rana nu pratta dunko,"
"shag. (Connected?? Whada you mean, slave?)"
ANAKIN (subtitled) Oh da Hutt… cha porko ootman geesa… me
teesa rodda co pana pee choppa chawa. (As in Hutt… big time
"outlander, this one… I’d hate to see you diced before we race again.)"
"SEBULBA (subtitled) Neek me chowa, wermo, mo killee ma"
"klounkee (Next time we race, wermo, it will be the end of you!) Una"
"noto wo shag, me wompity du pom pom. (If you weren’t a slave, I’d"
squash you right now.)
SEBULBA turns away.
"ANAKIN (subtitled) Eh, chee bana do mullee ra. (Yeah, it’d be a pity if"
you had to pay for me.)
"QUI-GON, PADME and ARTOO arrive."
ANAKIN (Cont’d) Hi! Your buddy here was about to be turned into
orange goo. He picked a fight with a Dug. An especially dangerous
Dug called Sebulba.
"JAR JAR Nosir, nosir. Mesa hate crunchen. Dat’s da last ting mesa"
wanten.
"QUI-GON Nevertheless, the boy is right… you were heading for"
"trouble. Thank you, my young friend."
PADME looks at ANAKIN and smiles; he smiles back. They start
walking down the crowded street.
JAR JAR Mesa doen nutten!
ANAKIN Fear attracts the fearful. He was trying to overcome his fear
by squashing you… be less afraid.
PADME And that works for you.
ANAKIN To a point. (he smiles)
EXT. TATOOINE – DESERT – SPACESHIP – DAY
OBI-WAN stands in front of the Naboo spacecraft as the wind picks
up and begins to whip at his robe. CAPTAIN PANAKA exits the ship
and joins him.
OBI-WAN This storm’s going to slow them down.
CAPT. PANAKA It looks pretty bad. We’d better seal the ship.
CAPTAIN PANAKA’S comlink sounds off.
CAPT. PANAKA (Cont’d) Yes?
CAPT. PANAKA We’ll be right there.
EXT. MOS ESPA – STREET – FRUIT STAND – DAY
"ANAKIN and the GROUP stop at a fruit stand run by a jolly, but very"
"poor, old lady named JIRA."
"ANAKIN How are you feeling today, Jira?"
"JIRA The heat’s never been kind to me, you know, Annie!"
ANAKIN Guess what? I’ve found that cooling unit I’ve been searching
"for. It’s pretty beat up, but I’ll have it fixed up for you in no time, I"
promise.
"JIRA You’re a fine boy, Annie."
ANAKIN I’ll take four pallies today. (to Padme) You’ll like these…
ANAKIN reaches in his pocket and comes up with three coins. He
"drops one. QUI-GON picks it up, revealing for a moment, his"
lightsaber.
"ANAKIN (Cont’d) Whoops, I thought I had more… Make that three,"
I’m not hungry.
The wind picks up. SHOP OWNERS are starting to close up their
shops as JIRA gives them their pallies.
"JIRA Gracious, my bones are aching… storm’s coming on, Annie."
You’d better get home quick.
ANAKIN (to QUI-GON) Do you have shelter?
QUI-GON We’ll head back to our ship.
ANAKIN Is it far?
PADME On the outskirts.
ANAKIN You’ll never reach the outskirts in time… sandstorms are
"very, very dangerous. Come with me. Hurry!"
The GROUP follows ANAKIN as he rushes down the windy street.
EXT. MOS ESPA – SLAVE QUARTERS – STREET – SANDSTORM
– DAY
"The wind is blowing hard as QUI-GON, JAR JAR, and PADME follow"
ANAKIN down the street and into a slave hovel.
INT. ANAKIN’S HOVEL – MAIN ROOM – DAY
"QUI-GON, JAR JAR, ARTOO, and PADME enter a small living"
space.
ANAKIN Mom! Mom! I’m home.
JAR JAR Dissen cozy.
"Anakin’s mother, SHMI SKYWALKER, a warm, friendly woman of"
"forty, enters from her work area and is startled to see the room full of"
people.
"SHMI Oh, my!! Annie, what’s this?"
"ANAKIN These are my friends, Mom. This is Padme, and… gee, I"
don’t know any of your names.
"QUI-GON I’m Qui-Gon Jinn, and this is Jar jar Binks. ARTOO lets out"
a little beep.
"PADME … and our droid, Artoo-Detoo."
ANAKIN I’m building a droid. You wanna see?
SHMI Anakin! Why are they here?
"ANAKIN A sandstorm, Mom. Listen."
The wind HOWLS outside.
QUI-GON Your son was kind enough to offer us shelter.
ANAKIN Come on! Let me show you Threepio!
"ANAKIN leads PADME into the other room. ARTOO follows, beeping"
all the way. QUI-GON takes five small capsules from his utility belt
and hands them to SHMI.
QUI-GON I have enough food for a meal.
"SHMI Oh, tank you. Thank you so much. I’m sorry if I was abrupt. I’ll"
never get used to Anakin’s surprises.
QUI-GON He’s a very special boy.
SHMI looks at him as if he’s discovered a secret.
"SHMI Yes, I know."
INT. ANAKIN’S HOVEL – BEDROOM – DAY
"ANAKIN shows off his ANDROID, which is lying on his workbench."
"There is one eye in the head; the body, arms, and legs have no outer"
coverings.
ANAKIN Isn’t he great?! He’s not finished yet.
PADME He’s wonderful!
ANAKIN You really like him? He’s a protocol droid… to help Mom.
Watch!
"ANAKIN pushes a switch, and the DROID sits up. Anakin rushes"
"around, grabs an eye and puts it in one of the sockets."
"THREEPIO How do you do, I am See-Threepio, Human Cyborg"
Relations. How might I serve you?
PADME He’s perfect.
"ANAKIN When the storm is over, you can see my racer. I’m building a"
Podracer!
PADME smiles at his enthusiasm. ARTOO lets out a flurry of beeps
and whistles.
THREEPIO I beg your pardon…what do you mean I’m naked?
ARTOO BEEPS
"THREEPIO (Cont’d) My parts are showing? Oh, my goodness. How"
embarrassing!
INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT – QUEENS CHAMBERS
"AMIDALA, EIRTAE, RABE, and OBI-WAN watch a very bad"
transmission of a SIO BIBBLE hologram.
BIBBLE … cut off all food supplies until you return… the death toll is
"catastrophic… we must bow to their wishes, Your Highness… Please"
"tell us what to do! If you can hear us, Your Highness, you must"
contact me…
AMIDALA looks upset… almost nervous.
OBI-WAN It’s a trick. Send no reply… Send no transmission of any
kind.
INT. ANAKIN’S HOVEL – MAIN ROOM – DAY
QUI-GON listens to his comlink. OBI-WAN is in the cockpit.
OBI-WAN … the Queen is upset… but absolutely no reply was sent.
QUI-GON It sounds like bait to establish a connection trace.
OBI-WAN What if it is true and the people are dying?
"QUI-GON Either way, we’re running out of time."
EXT. CORUSCANT – BALCONY OVERLOOKING CITY – NIGHT
DARTH SIDIOUS and DARTH MAUL look out over the vast city.
DARTH MAUL Tatooine is sparsely populated. If the trace was
"correct, I will find them quickly, Master."
DARTH SIDIOUS Move against the Jedi first… you will then have no
"difficulty taking the Queen back to Naboo, where she will sign the"
treaty.
DARTH MAUL At last we will reveal ourselves to the Jedi. At last we
will have revenge.
"DARTH SIDIOUS You have been well trained, my young apprentice,"
they will be no match for you. It is too late for them to stop us now.
Everything is going as planned. The Republic will soon be in my
command.
The hologram of DARTH MAUL fades off as DARTH SIDIOUS looks
out over the city.
EXT. MOS ESPA – SANDSTORM – DAY
"The giant sandstorm engulfs the town, including the Naboo spaceship"
"on the outskirts of the city center, where Watto’s ship is; and the"
"slave quarters, where drifts of sand begin building up against"
Anakin’s house.
INT. ANAKIN’S HOVEL – MAIN ROOM – DAY
"QUI-GON, ANAKIN, SHMI, JAR JAR, and PADME are seated around"
"a makeshift table, having dinner as the wind howls outside. JAR JAR"
slurps his soup rather loudly. Everyone looks at him. He turns a little
brighter red.
SHMI All slaves have transmitters placed inside their bodies
somewhere.
"ANAKIN I’ve been working on a scanner to try and locate them, but"
no luck.
SHMI Any attempt to escape…
ANAKIN … and they blow you up… poof!
PADME and JAR JAR are horrified.
JAR JAR How wude.
PADME I can’t believe there is still slavery in the galaxy. The
Republic’s anti-slavery laws…
SHMI The Republic doesn’t exist out here… we must survive on our
own.
An awkward silence. ANAKIN attempts to end the embarrassment.
ANAKIN Have you ever seen a Podrace?
PADME shakes her head no. She notices the concern of SHMI. JAR
JAR snatches some food from a bowl at the other end of the table
with his tongue. QUI-GON gives him a dirty look.
"QUI-GON They have Podracing on Malastare. Very fast, very"
dangerous.
ANAKIN I’m the only human who can do it.
SHMI looks askance at her son.
"ANAKIN (Cont’d) Mom, what? I’m not bragging. It’s true. Watto says"
he’s never heard of a human doing it.
QUI-GON You must have Jedi reflexes if you race Pods.
ANAKIN smiles. JAR JAR attempts to snare another bit of food from
"the bowl with his tongue, but QUI-GON, in a flash, grabs it between"
his thumb and forefinger. JAR JAR is startled.
QUI-GON (Cont’d) Don’t do that again.
JAR JAR tries to acknowledge with some silly mumbling. QUI-GON
"lets go of the tongue, and it snaps back into JAR JAR’s mouth."
ANAKIN I… I was wondering… something…
QUI-GON What?
"ANAKIN Well, ahhh… you’re a Jedi Knight, aren’t you?"
QUI-GON What makes you think that?
ANAKIN I saw your laser sword. Only Jedi carry that kind of weapon.
QUI-GON leans back and slowly smiles.
QUI-GON Perhaps I killed a Jedi and stole it from him.
ANAKIN I don’t think so… No one can kill a Jedi Knight.
QUI-GON I wish that were so…
ANAKIN I had a dream I was a Jedi. I came back here and freed all
the slaves… have you come to free us?
"QUI-GON No, I’m afraid not…"
ANAKIN I think you have… why else would you be here?
QUI-GON thinks for a moment.
QUI-GON I can see there’s no fooling you… (leans forward) You
"mustn’t let anyone know about us… we’re on our way to Coruscant,"
"the central system in the Republic, on a very important mission, and it"
must be kept secret.
ANAKIN Coruscant… wow… how did you end up here in the outer
rim?
"PADME Our ship was damaged, and we’re stranded here until we"
can repair it.
ANAKIN I can help! I can fix anything!
"QUI-GON I believe you can, but our first job is to acquire the parts we"
need…
JAR JAR Wit no-nutten mula to trade.
PADME These junk dealers must have a weakness of some kind.
SHMI Gambling. Everything here revolves around betting on those
awful races.
QUI-GON Podracing… Greed can be a powerful ally.. if it’s used
properly.
ANAKIN I’ve built a racer! It’s the fastest ever… There’s a big race
"tomorrow, on Boonta Eve. You could enter my pod. It’s all but"
finished…
"SHMI Anakin, settle down. Watto won’t let you…"
ANAKIN Watto doesn’t know I’ve built it. (to Qui-Gon) You could
"make him think it’s yours, and you could get him to let me pilot it for"
you.
QUI-GON looks to SHMI. She is upset.
"SHMI I don’t want you to race, Annie… It’s awful. I die every time"
Watto makes you do it.
"ANAKIN But Mom, I love it… and they need help… they’re in trouble."
The prize money would more than pay for the parts they need.
JAR JAR Wesa ina pitty bad goo.
GUI-GON Your mother’s right. Is there anyone friendly to the
Republic who might be able to help us?
SHMI shakes her head no.
"ANAKIN We have to help them, Mom… you said that the biggest"
problem in the universe is no one helps each other…
"SHMI Anakin, don’t…"
JAR JAR belches. There is silence for a moment as they eat.
PADME I’m sure Qui-Gon doesn’t want to put your son in danger. We
will find another way…
"SHMI No, Annie’s right, there is no other way… I may not like it, but"
he can help you… he was meant to help you.
ANAKIN Is that a yes? That is a yes!
The storm continues to rage outside the slave hovel.
EXT. MOS ESPA – JUNK DEALER PLAZA – DAY
The storm has passed. VENDORS and STREET PEOPLE clean up
the mess and rebuild their food stalls. JAR JAR sits on a box in front
"of Watto’s parts shop, watching all the activity with growing"
nervousness. ARTOO is standing next to him. PADME stops QUIGON
as he is about to enter the shop.
PADME Are you sure about this? Trusting our fate to a boy we hardly
know. The Queen will not approve.
QUI-GON The Queen does not need to know.
"PADME Well, I don’t approve."
QUI-GON turns and starts into the shop.
INT. WATTO’S JUNK SHOP – DAY
WATTO and ANAKIN are in the middle of an animated discussion in
Huttese.
WATTO Patta go bolla!
ANKAIN No batta!
WATTO Pedunky. Maa kee cheelya.
"ANAKIN Bayno, Bayno!"
"QUI-GON walks in, and WATTO and ANAKIN join him."
WATTO The boy tells me you wanta sponser hi insa race. You can’t
"afford parts. How can you do this? Not on Republic credits, I think."
(he laughs)
QUI-GON My ship will be the entry fee.
QUI-GON pulls a small object that looks like a watch out of his
"pocket, and a hologram of the Naboo spacecraft appears about a foot"
long in front of WATTO. He studies it.
WATTO Not bad… not bad… a Nubian.
"QUI-GON It’s in good order, except for the parts we need."
WATTO … but what would the boy ride? He smashed up my Pod in
the last race. It will take some time to fix it.
ANAKIN is embarrassed and steps forward.
ANAKIN Ahhhh… it wasn’t my fault really… Sebulba flashed me with
his vent ports. I actually saved the Pod… mostly.
"WATTO (laughing) That you did. The boy is good, no doubts there."
QUI-GON I have… acquired a Pod in a game of chance. “The fastest
ever built.”
"WATTO I hope you didn’t kill anyone I know for it. (laughs) So, you"
supply the Pod and the entry fee; I supply the boy. We split the
"winnings fifty-fifty, I think."
"QUI-GON Fifty-fifty!?! If it’s going to be fifty-fifty, I suggest you front"
"the cash for the entry. If we win, you keep all the winnings, minus the"
"cost of the parts I need… If we lose, you keep my ship."
WATTO thinks about this. ANAKIN tries not to be nervous.
"QUI-GON (Cont’d) Either way, you win."
"WATTO (subtitled) Deal! Yo bana pee ho-tah, meedee ya. (Your"
"friend is a foolish one, methinks.)"
EXT. NABOO SPACECRAFT – TATOOINE DESERT – DAY
"OBI-WAN stands outside the Naboo spacecraft, speaking into his"
comlink. QUI-GON is on the back porch of the hovel.
"OBI-WAN What if this plan fails, Master? We could be stuck here for"
a long time.
QUI-GON (V.O) A ship without a power supply will not get us
"anywhere, and there is something about this boy…"
EXT MOS ESPA – SLAVE QUARTERS – PORCH – DAY
QUI-GON puts the comlink away as SHMI comes onto the porch.
"PADME, ANAKIN, JAR JAR, and ARTOO work on the engines of the"
Podracer in the courtyard below.
QUI-GON You should be proud of your son. He gives without any
thought of reward.
SHMI He knows nothing of greed. He has…
QUI-GON He has special powers.
SHMI Yes…
QUI-GON He can see things before they happen. That’s why he
appears to have such quick reflexes. It is a Jedi trait.
SHMI He deserves better than a slave’s life.
"QUI-GON The Force is unusually strong with him, that much is clear."
Who was his father?
"SHMI There was no father, that I know of… I carried him, I gave him"
birth… I can’t explain what happened. Can you help him?
"QUI-GON I’m afraid not. Had he been born in the Republic, we would"
"have identified him early, and he would have become Jedi, no"
"doubt… he has the way. But it’s too late for him now, he’s too old."
EXT. MOS ESPA – SLAVE QUARTERS – BACK YARD – DAY
"KITSTER (a young boy about Anakin’s age), SEEK (a boy of ten),"
"AMEE (a girl of six), and WALD (a Greedo Type, six years old) join"
"ANAKIN, JAR JAR, ARTOO, and PADME securing some wiring."
"ANAKIN Padme and Jar Jar, this is my friend Kitster, and Seek,"
"Amee, and Wald."
"All whistle, hoot, and speak a greeting."
"KITSTER Wow, a real Astro Droid… how’d you get so lucky?"
ANAKIN This isn’t the half of it. I’m entered in the Boonta Race
tomorrow!
KITSTER What? With this??
"WALD (subtitled) Annie, Jesko na joka. (You are such a joke, Annie.)"
AMEE You’ve been working on that thing for years. It’s never going to
run.
"SEEK Come on, let’s go play ball. Keep it up, Annie, and you’re"
gonna be bug squash.
"SEEK, WALD, and AMEE take off, laughing. JAR JAR is fiddling with"
one of the energy binder plates.
ANAKIN Hey! Jar jar! Stay away from those energy binders…
"JAR JAR Who, mesa?"
"ANAKIN If your hand gets caught in that beam, it will go numb for"
hours.
"JAR JAR peeks at the energy plate; it makes a little electronic pop,"
zaps him in the mouth and jumps back. JAR JAR tries to say
"something, but his mouth is numb and his words are garbled."
JAR JAR Ouch-dats muy bigo Oucho. (Gibberish)
KITSTER But you don’t even know if this thing will run.
ANAKIN It will.
QUI-GON approaches the GROUP and gives ANAKIN a small
battery. JAR JAR gets his hand caught in the afterburner and tries to
"tell Anakin, but can’t get words out that make sense."
QUI-GON I think it’s time we found out. Use this power charge.
"ANAKIN Yes, sir!!"
ANAKIN jumps into the little capsule behind the two giant engines. He
puts the power pack back into the dashboard. EVERYONE backs
"away, except for JAR JAR who calls for help. Finally PADME frees"
him and the engines ignite with a ROAR. EVERYONE cheers.
EXT. MOS ESPA – SLAVE QUARTERS – PORCH – DAY
"SHMI, watching from the porch, smiles sadly."
EXT. SLAVE QUARTERS – BALCONY – NIGHT
ANAKIN sits on the balcony rail of his hovel as QUI-GON tends to a
cut. The BOY leans back to look at the vast blanket of stars in the
sky.
"QUI-GON Sit still, Annie. Let me clean this cut."
ANAKIN There are so many! Do they all have a system of planets?
QUI-GON Most of them.
ANAKIN Has anyone been to them all?
QUI-G0N (laughs) Not likely.
ANAKIN I want to be the first one to see them all… Ouch!
QUI-GON wipes a patch of blood off ANAKIN’S arm.
"QUI-GON There, good as new…"
SHMI yells from inside the hovel.
"SHMI (O.S.) Annie, bedtime!"
QUI-GON scrapes ANAKIN’s blood onto a comlink chip.
ANAKIN What are you doing?
QUI-GON Checking your blood for infections.
ANAKIN I’ve never seen…
SHMI (O.S.) Annie! I’m not going to tell you again!
"QUI-GON Go on, you have a big day tomorrow. (beat) Goodnight."
ANAKIN rolls his eyes and runs into the hovel. QUI-GON takes the
"blood stained chip and inserts it into the comlink, then calls OBIWAN."
QUI-GON (Cont’d) Obi-Wan…
"OBI-WAN Yes, Master."
QUI-GON Make an analysis of this blood sample I’m sending you.
OBI-WAN Wait a minute…
QUI-GON I need a midi-chlorian count.
OBI-WAN All right. I’ve got it.
QUI-GON What are your readings?
OBI-WAN Something must be wrong with the transmission.
QUI-GON Here’s a signal check.
"OBI-WAN Strange. The transmission seems to be in good order, but"
the reading’s off the chart… over twenty thousand.
QUI-GON (almost to himself) That’s it then.
OBI-WAN Even Master Yoda doesn’t have a midi-chlorian count that
high!
QUI-GON No Jedi has.
OBI-WAN What does it mean?
QUI-GON I’m not sure.
The JEDI KNIGHT looks up and sees SHMI in the doorway watching
"him. Embarrassed, she goes back into the kitchen while QUI-GON"
ponders the situation.
EXT. TATOOINE – DESERT MESA – NIGHT
The sinister looking Sith spacecraft lands on top of a desert mesa at
"dusk, scattering a herd of banthas. DARTH MAUL walks to the edge"
of the mesa and studies the landscape with a pair of
electrobinoculars. He picks out the lights of three different cities in the
"distance, then pushes buttons on his electronic armband. Six footballsized"
PROBE DROIDS float out of the ship and head off in three
different directions toward the cities. DARTH MAUL stands on the
mesa and watches them through his electrobinoculars.
EXT. MOS ESPA – SLAVE QUARTERS – PORCH – SUNRISE
Padme exits the hovel.
EXT. MOS ESPA – SLAVE QUARTERS – BACK YARD – SUNRISE
"As the twin suns rise, ARTOO is busy painting the racing Pod."
ANAKIN is asleep. PADME passes ARTOO.
PADME I hope you’re about finished.
ARTOO whistles a positive reply. PADME sees KITSTER riding
"toward them on an EOPIE, a strange camel-like creature. He is"
leading a second EOPIE behind him. PADME goes over to ANAKIN.
"He looks very vulnerable as he sleeps. She watches him, then"
"touches him on the cheek. ANAKIN wakes up, yawns, and looks at"
"her, a little puzzled."
ANAKIN: You were in my dream… you were leading a huge army into
battle.
PADME I hope not; I hate fighting. Your mother wants you to come in
and clean up. We have to leave soon.
ANAKIN stands up and stretches just as KITSTER arrives.
"ANAKIN Hook ‘em up, Kitster. (to Padme) I won’t be long. Where’s"
Qui-Gon?
PADME He and Jar jar left already. They’re with Watto at the arena.
EXT. MOS ESPA – ARENA – MAIN HANGER – DAY
RACE CREWS mill about outside the Main Hanger.
INT. MOS ESPA – ARENA – MAIN HANGER – DAY
The hanger is a large building with a dozen or so Podracers being
"readied for the race. ALIEN CREWS and PILOTS rush about, making"
"last minute fixes on their vehicles. WATTO, QUI-GON, and JAR JAR"
walk through the activity.
WATTO … I want to see your spaceship the moment the race is over.
"QUI-GON Patience, my blue friend. You’ll have your winnings before"
"the suns set, and we’ll be far away from here."
"WATTO Not if your ship belongs to me, I think… I warn you, no funny"
business.
QUI-GON You don’t think Anakin will win?
"WATTO stops before an orange racer. Sitting to one side, having his"
"shoulders and neck massaged by TWIN YOBANAS, is SEBULBA."
WATTO Don’t get me wrongo. I have great faith in the boy. He’s a
"credit to your race, but Sebulba there is going to win, I think."
QUI-GON Why?
WATTO He always wins. (laughs) I’m betting heavily on Sebulba.
QUI-GON I’ll take that bet.
WATTO (suddenly stops laughing) What??!! What do you mean?
QUI-GON I’ll wager my new racing pod against… say… the boy and
his mother.
"WATTO A Pod for slaves. I don’t think so… well, perhaps. Just one…"
"the mother, maybe… the boy isn’t for sale."
"QUI-GON The boy is small, he can’t be worth much."
WATTO shakes his head.
QUI-GON (Cont’d) For the fastest Pod ever built?!
WATTO shakes his head again.
"QUI-GON (Cont’d) Both, or no bet."
WATTO No Pod’s worth two slaves… not by a long shot… one slave
or nothing.
"QUI-GON The boy, then…"
WATTO pulls out a small cube from his pocket.
"WATTO We’ll let fate decide. Blue it’s the boy, red his mother…"
WATTO tosses the cube down. QUI-GON lifts his hand slightly; it
turns blue. QUI-GON smiles. WATTO is angry.
"WATTO (Cont’d) You won the small toss, outlander, bou you won’t"
"win the race, so… it makes little difference."
"ANAKIN and PADME enter the hanger on one of the EOPIES, pulling"
"an engine. KITSTER, on the other EOPIE, is pulling another engine."
"With THREEPIO walking alongside, ARTOO trundles behind, pulling"
the Pod with SHMI sitting on it. WATTO passes ANAKIN as he
leaves.
"WATTO (Cont’d) (subtitled) Bonapa keesa pateeso, o wanna meetee"
"chobodd. (Better stop your friends betting, or I’ll end up owning him,"
too.)
"WATTO walks off, laughing."
ANAKIN What did he mean by that?
QUI-GON I’ll tell you later.
ARTOO beeps at THREEPIO.
THREEPIO Oh my! Space travel sounds rather perilous.
ARTOO emits a series of beeps.
THREEPIO I can assure you they will never get me onto one of those
dreadful starships!
"KITSTER (to Anakin) This is so wizard! I’m sure you’ll do it this time,"
Annie.
PADME Do what?
"KITSTER Finish the race, of course!"
PADME You’ve never won a race?
ANAKIN Well… not exactly…
PADME Not even finished?!
ANAKN looks sheepish.
"ANAKIN … but Kitster’s right, I will this time."
QUI-GON Of course you will.
EXT. MOS ESPA – STREET – DAY
One of Darth Maul’s PROBE DROIDS slowly floats down the main
street of Tatooine. It looks in shops and studies PEOPLE as it
"searches for OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, or the QUEEN."
EXT. MOS ESPA – DESERT RACE ARENA – DAY
An EXTREME HIGH WIDE ANGLE reveals a vast arena in the
Tatooine desert. A large semi-circular amphitheatre that holds at least
a hundred thousand people dominates the landscape. Large viewing
platforms loom over the racetrack.
INT. MOS ESPA – ARENA ANNOUNCER’S BOX – DAY (FX)
A two-headed ANNOUNCER describes the scene.
FODE/BEED A: Toogi! Toogie! (Greetings) Toong mee cha kulkah du
Boonta magi! tah oos azalus ooval Poddraces. (We have perfect
weather today for the Boonta classic. The most hazardous of all
"Podraces.) B: That’s absolutly right. And a big turnout here, from all"
corners of the Outer Rim territories. I see the contestants are making
their way out onto the starting grid.
EXT. MOS ESPA – DESERT RACE ARENA – DAY
"On the left side of the tracks across from the grandstands, a line of"
"Podracers emerges from the large hanger, surrounded by several"
CREW MEMBERS. Pods are pulled by a wide variety of
CREATURES and are led by aliens carrying flags. The PILOTS stand
facing the royal box.
"FODE/BEED (O.S) A: La Yma beestoo (Yes, there they are!) B: I see"
Ben Quadinaros from the Tund system. A: … eh Gasgano doowa

flaggers are moving onto the track.
EXT. MOS ESPA – ARENA – GRANDSTAND – DAY
Colorful canopies shade some of the SPECTATORS. VENDORS sell
barbecued creature parts and colorful drinks.
EXT. MOS ESPA – ARENA – ROYAL BOX – DAY (FX)
All the PILOTS bow from the waist as JABBA THE HUTT enters the
box and waves to the crowd.
"FODE/BEED A: O grandio lust, Jabba Du Hutt, amu intoe tah"
"parena. (His honor, our glorious host, Jabba the Hutt has entered the"
arena.)
"The crowd ROARS. SEVERAL OTHER SLUG-LIKE HUTTS follow,"
along with humans and aliens. Several SLAVE GIRLS on a chain are
led alongside JABBA.
"JABBA (subtitled) Chowbaso! Tam ka chee Boonta rulee ya, kee"
madda hodrudda du wundee. (Welcome!) Sebulba tuta Pixelito…
EXT. MOS ESPA – ARENA – STARTING GRID – DAY
"SEBULBA, who is right next to ANAKIN, stands and waves to his"
fans. A small pep band plays as his fans wave and cheer. KITSTER
attaches the giant engins to Anakin’s Pod with a long cable. SHMI
gives ANAKIN a big hug and kiss. She looks him right in the eye.
SHMI Be safe.
"ANAKIN I will, Mom. I promise."
She leaves as ANAKIN checks the cable hitches.
"JABBA … Mawhonic tuta Hok, Teemto Pagalies tuta Moonus"
"Mandel, Anakin Skywalker tuta Tatooine…"
"The CROWD YELLS. ANAKIN waves to the crowd, as JABBA"
continues with his introductions. SEBULBA moves over to one of
"Anakin’s engines. KITSTER and JAR JAR unhitch the EOPIES, and"
KITSTER leads them away. ARTOO beeps that everything is OK.
JAR JAR pats ANAKIN on the back.
"JAR JAR Dis berry loony, Annie. May da guds be kind, mesa palo."
PADME comes up and gives ANAKIN a little kiss on the cheek.
SEBULBA bangs on a part protruding from Anakin’s engine. He looks
around to see if anyone has noticed.
PADME You carry all our hopes.
ANAKIN I won’t let you down.
PADME moves away as SEBULBA edges his way next to ANAKIN
and gives him a sinister grin.
"SEBULBA Bazda wahota, shag. Dobiella Nok. Yoka to Bantha"
"poodoo. (You won’t walk away from this one, slave scum! You’re"
Bantha poodoo.)
"ANAKIN (subtitled) Cha skrundee da pat, sleemo. (Don’t count on it,"
slime-ball.)
ANAKIN looks the evil SEBULBA in the eye with a cold stare. QUIGON
"approaches, and SEBULBA backs off toward his racer."
JABBA (sutitled) … Ka bazza kundee hodrudda! (… Let the challenge
begin!)
The CROWD lets out a LOUD CHEER. QUI-GON helps ANAKIN into
his Pod. The boy straps himself into the tiny racer.
"QUI-GON Are you all set, Annie? (Anakin nods) Remember,"
concentrate on the moment. Feel. Don’t think. Trust your instincts.
(he smiles) May the Force be with you.
QUI-GON steps away as ANAKIN puts on his goggles. The PILOTS
"flip switches, and powerful energy binders shoot between the"
"engines. ANAKIN flips a switch, and his engine starts. The incredible"
ROAR of high-powered engines igniting echoes throughout the
"arena. One driver, ODY MANDRELL, yells at a droid (DUM-4) to get"
away from the front of his engine. The crowd is tense.
EXT. MOS ESPA – ARENA – STARTING GRID – DAY
The giant power-house engines torque as the PILOTS gun them. The
"PILOTS flip switches, and powerful energy binders shoot between the"
engines. Aliens carrying large flags move off the track. JAR JAR
covers his eyes.
JAR JAR Mesa no watch. Dissen ganna be messy!
FODE/BEED A: Ya pawa culka doe rundee! (The power couplings
"are being activated) B: Hey, it looks like they’re clearing the grid."
EXT. MOS ESPA – ARENA – VIEWING PLATFORM – DAY
SHMI looks nervously to QUI-GON as he enters a viewing platform.
PADME and JAR JAR are already on board. The platform rises like
an elevator.
SHMI Is he nervous?
QUI-GON He’s fine.
PADME You Jedi are far too reckless. The Queen…
"QUI-GON The Queen trusts my judgement, young handmaiden. You"
should too.
PADME You assume too much.
EXT. MOS ESPA – ARENA ANNOUNCER’S BOX – DAY (FX)
FODE/BEED B: Start your engines.
The earth-pounding ROAR of the engines revving is deafening.
EXT. MOS ESPA – ARENA – ROYAL BOX – DAY (FX)
"Jabba bites off the head of a frog and spits it at a gong, signaling the"
start of the race.
EXT. MOS ESPA – ARENA – STARTING GRID – DAY
"On a bridge over the track, a great green light at the center flashes."
The Podracers shoot forward with a high-pitches scream. ANAKIN’S
engine floods and coughs – then dies. All the other Podracers except
one swerve around him and disappear down the track. The slave boy
struggles to get his racer started. The two-headed announcer reports.
FODE/BEED (O.S.) A: An dare ovv! (And they’re off!) B: Oh… wait.
Little Skywalker has stalled.
PADME and JAR JAR are very disappointed with ANAKIN. QUI-GON
"puts his arm around a very worried SHMI to comfort her. Finally,"
Anakin’s engines ignite. He zooms away after the receding pack of
"competitors, leaving one quadra-Pod racer still trying to get started."
The two-headed ANNOUNCER describes the race as it progresses.
FODE/BEED (O.S.) B: And there goes Skywalker… He’ll be hard
pressed to catch up with the leaders today.
EXT. MOS ESPA – RACETRACK – DAY (FX)
The Podracers fly across the desert. SEBULBA is running neck and
"neck with MAWHONIC. They round the first turn in the track, side by"
"side. SEBULBA drives his Pod into his rival, forcing him into the wall"
of a large rock formation. MAWHONIC crashes in a spectacular
display of fire and smoke. ANAKIN is much faster than the back-end
"stragglers and passes them easily. One of the drivers, GASGANO,"
won’t let ANAKIN by. ANAKIN tries to pass him on one side and is cut
off. He then tries to pass him on the other side and is cut off. As they
"come up on a cliff drop-off, ANAKIN backs off, then guns it as"
GASGANO goes over the cliff. ANAKIN accelerates so fast that he
sails right over the top of GASGANO and speeds away. Four
TUSKEN RAIDERS perched above the race course fire their rifles at
the Pods racing in the canyon below them. One shot ricochets off the
back of Anakin’s Pod.
FODE/BEED B: Looks like a few Tusken Raiders have camped out
on the canyon dune turn.
EXT. MOS ESPA – ARENA – VIEWING PLATFORM – DAY
JABBA THE HUTT and the crowd watch the progress of the race on
"small, hand-held view screens. JAR JAR is looking over the shoulder"
of a strange alien named FANTA.
JAR JAR Where’s Skywalker?
"FANTA moves the view screen out of Jar jar’s view. PADME, SHMI,"
"and QUI-GON watch another screen and look worried. ARTOO, down"
"in the pits with KITSTER, lets out a worried sigh. The driver of the"
quadra-Pod looks worried.
EXT. MOS ESPA – RACETRACK – DAY (FX)
"ANAKIN is powering around corners and over hills and cliffs, passing"
other racers right and left. SEBULBA is in the lead. He is being
"challenged by another racer, XELBREE. SEBULBA slows a little, and"
"as XELBREE pulls alongside, he opens a side vent on the racer’s"
engine and the exhaust starts to cut through the alien’s engine. The
blast cuts along the engine until finally it EXPLODES. SEBULBA
deftly veers away. ANAKIN works his way through a dense mass of
"racers as they zoom over a dune sea, kicking up dust. His Pod"
"shakes violently as he goes over a jump. One of the Podracers, ODY,"
"catches one of his engines in the sand, and the whole thing"
EXPLODES.
EXT. MOS ESPA – ARENA – VIEWING PLATFORM – DAY
"QUI-GON sits quietly, meditating. PADME and SHMI search the"
landscape for any sign of the racers. JAR JAR is still annoying
FANTA for information. The crowd SCREAMS. WATTO is laughing
"with his friends, confident in Anakin’s defeat. The quadra-Pod"
engines start just as the racers come around the corner. The
"DRIVER, BEN QUADINAROS, puts it in gear, and the four engines"
"go off in all directions, EXPLODING in a spectacular display. The Pod"
"drops to the ground as SEBULBA enters the arena, closely followed"
by all the OTHER RACERS. KITSTER strains to see as ARTOO
beeps excitedly. The announcer continues.
FODE/BEED (O.S) B: There goes Quadinaros’ power couplings. A:
Sebulba! Ka pa me cheespa wata! (Here comes Sebulba in record
time.)
"QUI-GON, PADME, SHMI, and JAR JAR yell for joy as ANAKIN"
passes. JAR JAR is very nervous and pounds on the back of his alien
"neighbor, FANTA."
JAR JAR What gooie-on?
FANTA Bug off.
Lap two. SEBULBA and the pack race past the main arena. The
crowd stands and YELLS as the Podracers scream off into the
distance. QUI-GON and PADME look worried.
JAR JAR He musta crash-ud.
PADME Here he comes!
EXT. MOS ESPA – ARENA – PIT AREA – DAY (FX)
"ARTOO lets out an excited whistle, as KITSTER yells."
THREEPIO He has to complete two more circuits? Oh dear!
EXT. MOS ESPA – RACETRACK – DAY (FX)
"Sure enough, coming around the bend is ANAKIN, quickly gaining on"
the pack. The two-headed announcer describes the action. The
crowd goes wild.
FODE/BEED (O.S.) B: It looks like Skywalker is moving up through
"the field. He’s in… A: Steeth pa nagoola! (Sixth place, not bad.)"
ANAKIN continues to gain on the pack. Tension for SHMI and
PADME is unbearable. ODY stops in the pits. Droids work on his
"engines. DUM-4 stands in front of the engine and is sucked in,"
"causing the engine to die. DUM-4 is spit out the back of the engine,"
"very bent up. The engine lets out one final wheeze, then EXPLODES"
in a puff of smoke.
FODE/BEED (O.S.) A: Ody Mandrell! Coona wa wunda dunko! (Ody
Mandrell into the pits for some attention.) ODY: Droids!
"TERTER is getting close to SEBULBA, who purposely breaks a small"
"part off his Pod, sending it into Terter’s engine, causing him to veer"
"into ANAKIN, and unhooks one of the main straps on Anakin’s"
engines that links the Pod to his engines. ANAKIN struggles to keep
control of the little Pod. It whips about wildly. As the Pod swings near
"the broken engine strap, ANAKIN grabs for it. Finally, he catches the"
strap and manages to unhook it to the Pod. SEBULBA cuts the
"engine of OBITOKI with his side exhaust, and the racer crashes with"
"a cloud of dust. A THIRD RACER, HABBA, flies into the cloud of dust"
and crashes into OBITOKI. ANAKIN rounds a corner and heads into
the cloud of smoke. He hits a part of one of the engines but regains
control.
"FODE/BEED (O.S.) B:At the start of the third and final lap, Sebulba is"
"in the lead, closely followed by Skywalker…"
"ANAKIN finally catches up with SEBULBA, and runs neck and neck"
"over the rough terrain. JAR JAR, QUI-GON, SHMI, and PADME all"
SCREAM s ANAKIN comes through the arena. The lights in the tower
indicate that this is the third and last lap. WATTO begins to worry.
SEBULBA uses his side exhaust port to try to cut through Anakin’s
engines. ANAKIN manages to avoid having his engine disabled but is
forced off course.
FODE/BEED (O.S.) B: Skywalker is forced onto the service ramp! A:
Oh noah!
"On a tight corner, ANAKIN dives to the inside and takes the lead."
FODE BEED (O.S.) B: Amazing… a controlled thrust and he’s back
on course! What a move!
"SEBULBA is furious. He stay’s right on Anakin’s tail, crowding him"
and pushing him through the turns. SEBULBA pushes ANAKIN
"harder, and the young boy has a difficult time keeping control. One of"
the parts on Anakin’s engines begins to shake loose. ANAKIN sees it
and switches over to an auxiliary system. While he is trying to
"accomplish this maneuver, SEBULBA races past him. ANAKIN tries"
"to get around SEBULBA, to no avail. Every move ANAKIN makes,"
"SEBULBA is able to block. Finally, ANAKIN fakes a move into the"
"inside as he usually does, then tries to go around SEBULBA on the"
outside. They race side by side down the final stretch of the track.
FODE/BEED (O.S.) B: He’s catching Sebulba. A:
Inkabunga. (Incredible!)
SEBULBA veers toward ANAKIN and bangs into his Pod. He crashes
into ANAKIN over and over. The young boy struggles to maintain
control as the steering rods on the two Pods become hooked
together. SEBULBA laughs at ANAKIN.
FODE/BEED (O.S.) B: That little human being is out of his mind. A:
Punda tah punda! (They’re neck and neck!) B: They’re side by
side! A: Bongo du bongu! (Shoulder to shoulder!)
"As they head for the final stretch, ANAKIN fights to unlock the"
steering rods by trying to pull away from SEBULBA. The strain on the
"steering rod is tremendous. Suddenly, ANAKIN’s steering arm"
"breaks, and his Pod starts spinning. The release of tension sends"
"SEBULBA into an ancient statue. One engine EXPLODES, then the"
"other. SEBULBA skids through the fire-balls, blackened, but unhurt."
"He slides to a smoking stop, gets out of his racer, and throws what’s"
left of a shifter arm on the ground. Suddenly he realizes his pants are
"on fire, and he struggles to put them out. ANAKIN flies through the"
"EXPLOSION as the crowd stands, CHERRING. PADME and JAR"
"JAR jump up and down with excitement, PADME screaming for joy."
ARTOO and KITSTER whistle hysterically. QUI-GON and SHMI
"smile. ANAKIN races over the finish line, the winner."
INT. MOS ESPA – ARENA ANNOUNCERS BOX – DAY (FX)
The two-headed announcer excitedly calls the finish.
FODE/BEED B: It’s Skywalker! The crowd are going nuts! Oh Ah Oh
Ah (rock head in tandem with partner)
EXT. MOS ESPA – ARENA – DAY
"As ANAKIN stops the Podracer, KISTER turns up, and they embrace."
Hundreds of SPECTATORS join them and put ANAKIN on their
"shoulders, marching off, CHEERING AND CHANTING. Darth Maul’s"
PROBE DROIDS move through the crowd.
INT. MOS ESPA – ARENA – PRIVATE BOX – DAY
"Several ALIENS leave Watto’s box, laughing and counting their"
money. WATTO sees QUI-GON standing in the doorway.
WATTO You! You swindled me! You knew the boy was going to win!
Somehow you knew it! I lost everything.
WATTO flies up to QUI-GON and puts his face right up against QUIGON’s.
QUI-GON simply smiles.
"QUI-GON Whenever you gamble, my friend, eventually you’ll lose."
Bring the parts to the main hanger. I’ll come by your shop later so you
can release the boy.
WATTO You can’t have him! It wasn’t a fair bet!
QUI-GON Would you like to discuss it with the Hutts… I’m sure they
can settle this.
"WATTO No, no! I want no more of your tricks! Take him!"
The SITH PROBE DROID watches with great interest.
EXT. MOS ESPA – ARENA – MAIN HANGER – DAY
The Main Hanger is almost deserted as RACERS depart.
INT. MOS ESPA – ARENA – MAIN HANGER – DAY
"JAR JAR gives ANAKIN a great hug, then PADME gives him a hug,"
then SHMI.
"ANAKIN Ah, gee… enough of this…"
"SHMI It’s so wonderful, Annie. You have brought hope to those who"
have none. I’m so very proud of you…
PADME We owe you everything.
ANAKIN Just feeling this good was worth it.
"In the background, QUI-GON has harnessed the EOPIES to"
containers full of parts.
"QUI-GON Padme. Jar jar, let’s go, we’ve got to get these parts back"
to the ship.
The GROUP walks over to QUI-GON and the EOPIES. PADME
climbs on behind QUI-GON. JAR JAR swings up onto the second
"EOPIE, only to slowly slide off the other side. ARTOO whistles."
ANAKIN and SHMI wave as they ride off.
QUI-GON (Cont’d) I’ll return the eopies by midday.
EXT. TATOOINE – DESERT – NABOO SPACECRAFT – DAY
"ARTOO cruises ahead of QUI-GON and PADME, who are riding one"
of the EOPIES; JAR JAR rides the other. They stop in front of the
sleek Naboo spacecraft. OBI-WAN comes out of the ship and joins
them.
QUI-GON Start getting this hyperdrive generator installed. I’m going
back… some unfinished business. I won’t be long.
OBI-WAN Why do I sense we’ve picked up another pathetic life
form… ?
QUI-GON It’s the boy who’s responsible for getting those parts.
"On a hill far overlooking the Naboo spacecraft, the SITH PROBE"
DROID turns and speeds away.
EXT. TATOOINE – STREET – SLAVE QUARTERS – DAY
"ANAKIN and A GREEDO are rolling around on the floor, fighting."
"About A DOZEN OR SO KIDS are standing around them, yelling."
"Suddenly, a long shadow is cast over the TWO BOYS; they stop"
fighting and look up. QUI-GON is towering above them. KITSTER is
with them.
QUI-GON What’s this?
ANAKIN He said I cheated.
QUI-GON Did you?
ANAKIN No!
QUI-GON Do you still think he cheated?
GREEDO Yes.
"QUI-GON Well, Annie. You know the truth… You will have to tolerate"
"his opinion, fighting won’t change it."
QUI-GON moves off down the street. Anakin follows. The GREEDO
wanders over to WALD who has been watching the goings-on.
"WALD Keep this up, Greedo, and you’re gonna come to a bad end."
Farther down the street QUI-GON and ANAKIN head toward Anakin’s
hovel. QUI-GON takes a handful of credits from beneath his poncho
and hands them to the boy.
QUI-GON These are yours. We sold the Pod.
ANAKIN (suddenly beaming) Yes!
INT. ANAKIN’S HOVEL – MAIN ROOM – DAY
"SHMI is cleaning up as ANAKIN bursts through the door, followed by"
QUI-GON.
"ANAKIN Mom, he sold the Pod. Look at all the money we have!"
ANAKIN pulls a bag of coins out of his pocket.
"SHMI Oh, my goodness, That’s wonderful."
QUI-GON And Anakin has been freed.
ANAKIN What?!?
QUI-GON You’re no longer a slave.
ANAKIN jumps for joy! SHMI is stunned.
"ANAKIN Did you hear that, Mom? (to Qui-Gon) Was that part of the"
"prize, or what?"
QUI-GON Let’s just say Watto has learned an important lesson about
gambling.
"SHMI Now you can make your dreams come true, Annie. You’re"
free! (turns to Qui-Gon) Will you take him with you? Is he to become
a Jedi?
QUI-GON Our meeting was not a coincidence. Nothing happens by
"accident. You are strong with the Force, but you may not be accepted"
by the Council.
"ANAKIN A Jedi! Mighty blasters, you mean I get to go with you in"
your starship and everything?!
QUI-GON kneels down to the boy.
"QUI-GON Anakin, training to be a Jedi will not be a easy challenge."
"And if you succeed, it will be a hard life."
ANAKIN But it’s what I want. What I’ve always dreamed about. Can I
"go, Mom?!"
"QUI-GON This path has been placed for you, Annie; the choice to"
take it is yours alone.
"ANAKIN thinks, looks to his mother, then to QUI-GON."
ANAKIN I want to go.
"QUI-GON Then, pack your things. We haven’t much time."
ANAKIN Yipee!!
"ANAKIN hugs his mom and starts for the other room, then stops."
SHMI and QUI-GON give each other a knowing look. ANAKIN has
realized something.
"ANAKIN (Cont’d) What about Mom? Is she free too? You’re coming,"
"aren’t you, Mom?"
"QUI-GON I tried to free your mother, Annie, but Watto wouldn’t have"
it.
ANAKIN But the money from selling…
QUI-GON It’s not nearly enough.
SHMI comes over to her son and sits next to him. Taking both of his
"hands in hers, she draws him close."
"SHMI Son, my place is here. My future is here. It is time for you to let"
go… to let go of me. I cannot go with you.
ANAKIN I want to stay with you. I don’t want things to change.
SHMI You can’t stop change any more than you can stop the suns
"from setting. Listen to your feelings; Annie, you know what’s right."
"ANAKIN takes a deep breath, drops his head. QUI-GON and SHMI"
"exchange a look of concern. When ANAKIN raises up, there are tears"
in his eyes.
"ANAKIN I’m going to miss you so much, Mom…"
"SHMI I love you, Annie… now hurry."
ANAKIN and SHMI hug. ANAKIN runs into the other room.
SHMI (Cont’d) Thank you.
QUI-GON I will watch after him. You have my word. Will you be all
right?
SHMI He was in my life for such a short time.
INT. ANAKIN’S HOVEL – SECOND ROOM – DAY
ANAKIN has thrown the last of his things in a small backpack. As he
"leaves, he stops and pushes the button that wakes his droid up."
THREEPIO stares at him blankly.
"ANAKIN Well, Threepio, I’m free… and I’m going away… in a"
starship…
"THREEPIO Master, Annie, you are my maker, and I wish you well."
Although I’d like it better if I were a little less naked.
"ANAKIN I’m sorry I wasn’t able to finish you, Threepio… give you"
coverings and all… I’m going to miss working on you. You’ve been a
great pal. I’ll make sure Mom doesn’t sell you or anything. Bye.
THREEPIO stares at ANAKIN as he rushes out of the room.
THREEPIO Sell me?!?
EXT. MOS ESPA – STREET – SLAVE QUARTERS – DAY
KITSTER runs up to ANAKIN as he and QUI-GON exit Anakin’s
hovel. SHMI stands in the doorway. ANAKIN pulls a handful of coins
out of his pocket and gives them to KITSTER.
"KITSTER There are so many of us who want you to stay, Annie…"
You’re a hero.
ANAKIN I… (looks to SHMI) I… have to go.
QUI-GON has moved a short way down the street.
KITSTER Well.
ANAKIN Well.
KITSTER Thanks for every moment you’ve been here. You’re my
best friend.
ANAKIN I won’t forget.
"ANAKIN hugs KITSTER and runs toward QUI-GON, then stops to"
look back at his mother standing in the doorway. He turns back to
"QUI-GON, then turns and runs back to his mother."
"ANAKIN (starting to cry) I can’t do it, Mom. I just can’t."
SHMI hugs ANAKIN. QUI-GON watches from the distance. She
kneels down and looks him in the face.
"SHMI Annie, remember when you climbed the great dune in order to"
chase the Banthas away so they wouldn’t be shot… Remember how
"you collapses several times, exhausted thinking you couldn’t do it?"
ANAKIN shakes his head.
SHMI (Cont’d) This is one of those times when you have to do
"something you don’t think you can do. I know how strong you are,"
Annie. I know you can do this…
ANAKIN Will I ever see you again?
SHMI What does your heart tell you?
ANAKIN I hope so… yes… I guess.
SHMI Then we will see each other again.
"ANAKIN I.. will become a Jedi and I will come back and free you,"
Mom… I promise.
"SHMI No matter where you are, my love will be with you. Now be"
"brave, and don’t look back… don’t look back."
ANAKIN I love you so much.
"SHMI hugs ANAKIN, then turns him around so he is facing QUI-GON,"
"and off he marches, like the brave little trooper that he is. He marches"
"right past QUI-GON, starring right ahead, tears in his eyes,"
determined not to look back.
EXT. TATOOINE – DESERT MESA – DAY
The PROBE DROID beeps and whistles to DARTH MAUL. The SITH
LORD gets on a speeder bike and follows the PROBE DROID into
Mos Espa.
EXT MOS ESPA – STREET – FRUIT STAND – DAY
ANAKIN and QUI-GON exit WATTO’S and stop before JIRA’S fruit
stand. ANAKIN hands JIRA some coins.
"ANAKIN I’ve been freed, and I’m going away. Buy yourself a cooling"
unit with this… Otherwise I’ll worry about you.
"JIRA is astonished. She stares, not knowing what to say."
JIRA Can I give you a hug
ANAKIN Sure.
She gives him a hug.
"JIRA I’ll miss you, Annie.. there isn’t a kinder boy in the galaxy. You"
be careful…
"ANAKIN runs to join QUI-GON, who has already started down the"
"street. As they walk along together, QUI-GON notices something out"
"of the corner of his eye. Suddenly, without breaking his stride, he"
"ignites his laser sword, swing around, and lunges forward and cuts a"
lurking PROBE DROID in half. QUI-GON inspects the sparking and
fizzing DROID.
ANAKIN What is it?
QUI-GON Probe droid. Very unusual… not like anything I’ve seen
before. Come on.
QUI-GON and ANAKIN start running.
EXT. TATOOINE – DESERT – NABOO SPACECRAFT – DAY
QUI-GON and ANAKIN run toward the Naboo spacecraft. ANAKIN is
having a hard time keeping up.
"ANAKIN Master Qui-Gon, sir, wait!"
QUI-GON turns to answer and sees a DARK-CLOAKED FIGURE
bearing down on a speeder bike.
"QUI-GON Anakin, drop!"
ANAKIN drops to the ground just as DARTH MAUL sweeps over him.
"DARTH MAUL jumps off his speeder bike, and before he has hit the"
"ground, the Sith Lord has swung a death blow with his laser sword"
that is barely blocked by QUI-GON. ANAKIN picks himself up. The
"two galactic warriors, Sith and Jedi, are bashing each other with"
"incredible blows. They move in a continual cloud of dust, smashing"
"everything around them. This is a fierce fight. ANAKIN gets up,"
bewildered by the confrontation.
"QUI-GON (Cont’d) Annie, get to the ship! Take off! Go! Go!"
QUI-GON struggles to fend off the relentless onslaught as ANAKIN
races to the ship.
INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT – HALLWAY
"ANAKIN runs into the main hallway of the spaceship, where PADME"
and CAPTAIN PANAKA are working.
ANAKIN Qui-Gon’s in trouble. He says to take off… now!!
CAPT. PANAKA Who are you?
PADME He’s a friend.
INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT – COCKPIT
"CAPTAIN PANAKA, ANAKIN, and PADME rush into the cockpit"
where OBI-WAN and RIC OLIE are checking the hyperdrive.
"CAPT. PANAKA Qui-Gon is in trouble, he says to take off!"
PILOT I don’t see anything.
OBI-WAN Over there! Fly low!
In the distance is a small cloud of dust.
EXT. TATOOINE – DESERT – NABOO SPACECRAFT – DAY
QUI-GON and DARTH MAUL continue their sword battle. Leaping
"over one another in an incredible display of acrobatics, the two"
warriors hear the ship fly over them a few feet off the ground. QUIGON
almost disappears for a moment. Before DARTH MAUL knows
"what’s happening, QUI-GON is on the spacecraft’s ramp."
EXT. TATOOINE – NABOO SPACECRAFT RAMP – DAY
"The SITH LORD immediately jumps onto the ramp after QUI-GON,"
but barely makes it. His heels hang over the edge of a forty-foot drop.
QUI-GON swings his laser sword with all his might and knocks
DARTH AMUL off the ramp and onto the desert floor. The ramp
"closes, and the Naboo craft rockets away, leaving the Sith Lord"
standing alone.
EXT. SPACE – NABOO SPACECRAFT (FX)
The sleek spacecraft rockets away from the planet Tatooine.
INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT – HALLWAY
ANAKIN and OBI-WAN rush into the hallway to find QUI-GON
collapsed on the floor opposite the entry. ARTOO is looking over him.
"The JEDI is breathing hard, wet with sweat and covered in dirt."
ANAKIN Are you all right?
QUI-GON I think so… that was a surprise I wont soon forget.
OBI-WAN What was it?
QUI-GON I don’t know… but he was well trained in the Jedi arts. My
guess is he was after the Queen…
ANAKIN Do you think he’ll follow us?
"QUI-GON We’ll be safe enough once we’re in hyperspace, but I have"
no doubt he knows our destination.
ANAKIN What are we going to do about it?
OBI-WAN gives ANAKIN a “who are you?” look. ANAKIN returns an
innocent stare.
"QUI-GON We will be patient. Anakin Skywalker, meet Obi-Wan"
Kenobi.
ANAKIN Pleased to meet you. Wow! You’re a Jedi too?
OBI-WAN gives the boy a skeptical look.
INT. COCKPIT – SPACE
"RIC OLIE pulls back on the hyperdrive. OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, and"
ANAKIN watch.
QUI-GON Let’s hope this hyperdrive works and Watto didn’t get the
last laugh.
The stars streak outside the cockpit window.
EXT. SPACE – NABOO SPACECRAFT (FX)

EXT. THEED – STREET – NIGHT (FX)
SEVERAL FEDERATION DROIDS patrol a deserted city street. The
Palace can be seen in the distance.
INT. NABOO PALACE – THRONE ROOM – THEED – NIGHT
"NUTE sits in a strange, mechanical walking chair, which approaches"
SIO BIBBLE and SEVERAL OTHER NABOO OFFICIALS. RUNE
follows a few paces behind. DROID GUARDS surround SIO BIBBLE
and THE OTHERS as FOUR COUNCIL MEMBERS watch.
NUTE When are you going to give up this pointless strike? Your
"Queen is lost, your people are starving, and you, Governor, are going"
"to die, much sooner than your people, I’m afraid. Take him away!"
BIBBLE This invasion will gain you nothing. We’re a democracy. The
people have decided… They will not live under your tyranny.
BIBBLE is taken away as OOM-9 approaches NUTE.
OOM-9 My troops are in position to begin searching the swamps for
these rumored underwater villages… they will not stay hidden for
long.
INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT – MAIN AREA
The ship is asleep. The lights are dim as PADME walks into the main
room. She goes to a monitor and watches the BIBBLE plea recording.
"JAR JAR is stretched out on the floor, snoring. ARTOO is to one side,"
cooing as he rests. PADME appears tired. She senses someone
watching her and turns around with a start. She sees ANAKIN sitting
"in the corner, shivering and looking very dejected. She goes over to"
him. He looks up at her with tears in his eyes. He is holding his arms
to keep himself warm.
PADME Are you all right?
ANAKIN It’s very cold.
PADME gives him her over-jacket.
"PADME You’re from a warm planet, Annie. Too warm for my taste."
Space is cold.
ANAKIN You seem sad.
PADME The Queen is… worried. Her people are suffering… dying.
"She must convince the Senate to intervene, or… I’m not sure what"
will happen.
ANAKIN I’m… I’m not sure what’s going to happen to me. I dunno if
I’ll ever see you again… (he pulls something from his pocket) I made
this for you. So you’d remember me. I carved it out of a japor
snippet… It will bring you good fortune.
"ANAKIN hands a wooden pendant to PADME. She inspects it, then"
puts it around her neck.
"PADME It’s beautiful, but I don’t need this to remember you. Many"
"things will change when we reach the capital, Annie. My caring for"
you will always remain.
ANAKIN I care for you too. Only I… miss…
ANAKIN is disturbed about something. Tears are in his eyes.
PADME … You miss your mother.
"ANAKIN looks at her, unable to speak. She hugs him."

"The spacecraft flies over the endless cityscape of Coruscant, the"
capital of the galaxy.
INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT – COCKPIT
ANAKIN looks out the cockpit window in awe.
RIC OLIE Coruscant… the capital of the Republic… the entire planet
is one big city.
ANAKIN Wow! It’s so huge!
INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT – DAY (FX)
The ship flies through the cityscape of Coruscant.
EXT. CORUSCANT – SENATE LANDING PLATFORM – DAY
"Supreme Chancellor VALORUM, SEVERAL GUARDS, and"
SENATOR PALPATINE stand on a landing platform. The sleek
Naboo spacecraft lands on the platform high above the street level of
"the galactic capital. The ramp lowers. OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, JAR JAR"
and ANAKIN descend the ramp first and bow before PALPATINE and
"VALORUM. CAPTAIN PANAKA, TWO GUARDS, QUEEN AMIDALA,"
"then PADME, RABE, EIRTAE, and MORE GUARDS descend the"
ramp. QUEEN AMIDALA stops before the group. ANAKIN and JAR
"JAR stand to one side, looking at the huge city. PADME smiles at"
ANAKIN. PALPATINE bows before the Queen.
"PALPATINE It is a great gift to see you alive, Your Majesty. May I"
present Supreme Chancellor Valorum.
"VALORUM Welcome, Your Highness. It is an honor to finally meet"
you in person. I must relay to you how distressed everyone is over
the currant situation. I’ve called for a special session of the Senate to
hear your position.
"AMIDALA I am grateful for your concern, Chancellor."
PALPATINE starts to lead QUEEN AMIDALA and her RETINUE off
the platform toward a waiting air taxi.
"PALPATINE There is a question of procedure, but I feel confident we"
can overcome it…
"JAR JAR and ANAKIN start to follow, then stop, noticing that OBIWAN"
and QUI-GON are staying with the SUPREME CHANCELLOR.
QUEEN AMIDALA waves to the duo to follow her. ANAKIN looks
"back to QUI-GON, and he nods to go ahead. ANAKIN and JAR JAR"
"join the QUEEN, PALPATINE, PADME, RABE and EIRTAE in the"
taxi. PALPATINE gives the Gungan and the boy in the back of the
taxi a skeptical look. JAR JAR leans over to ANAKIN.
"JAR JAR Da Queens- a bein grossly nice, mesa tinks. (he looks"
around) Pitty hot!
VALORUM and the JEDI watch the taxi move off into the city.
"QUI-GON I must speak with the Jedi Council immediately, Your"
Honor. The situation has become more complicated.
INT. PALPATINE’S QUARTERS – ANTEROOM – DAY
QUEEN AMIDALA is sitting listening to PALPATINE. EIRTAE and
RABE stand behind the QUEEN; PADME is nowhere to be seen.
ANAKIN and JAR JAR are waiting in an adjoining room. They can
see the Queen but cannot hear what is being said.
JAR JAR Dissen all pitty odd to my.
ANAKIN Don’t look at me. I don’t know what’s going on.
"CAPTAIN PANAKA enters, then goes into the room with QUEEN"
AMIDALA.
INT. PALPATINE’S QUARTERS – LIVING AREA – DAY
PALPATINE is pacing as CAPTAIN PANAKA enters. EIRTAE and
RABE stand to one side.
PALPATINE … the Republic is not what it once was. The Senate is
"full of greedy, squabbling delegates who are only looking out for"
themselves and their home systems. There is no interest in the
"common good… no civility, only politics… it’s disgusting. I must be"
"frank, Your Majesty, there is little chance the Senate will act on the"
invasion.
AMIDALA Chancellor Valorum seems to think there is hope.
"PALPATINE If I may say so, Your Majesty, the Chancellor has little"
real power… he is mired down by baseless accusations of corruption.
A manufactured scandal surrounds him. The bureaucrats are in
charge now.
AMIDALA What options do we have?
PALPATINE Our best choice would be to push for the election of a
stronger Supreme Chancellor. One who will take control of the
"bureaucrats, enforces the laws, and give us justice. You could call for"
a vote of no confidence in Chancellor Valorum.
AMIDALA He has been our strongest supporter. Is there any other
way?
PALPATINE Our only other choice would to be to submit a plea to the
courts…
AMIDALA There’s no time for that. The courts take even longer to
"decide things than the Senate. Our people are dying, Senator… more"
and more each day. We must do something quickly to stop the
Federation.
"PALPATINE To be realistic, Your Highness, I’d say we’re going to"
have to accept Federation control for the time being.
AMIDALA There is something I cannot do.
EXT. TEMPLE OF THE JEDI – DAY (FX)
A unique building with it tall spires stands out against the Coruscant
skyline. A small transport passes by the vast temple.
INT. TEMPLE OF THE JEDI – COUNCIL CHAMBERS – DAY
QUI-GON stands in a tall stately room. Twelve JEDI sit in a semicircle.
OBI-WAN stands behind QUI-GON in the center of the room.
The Senior Jedi is MACE WINDU. To his left is an alien Jedi named
"KI-ADI-MUNDI, and to his right, the Jedi Master, YODA."
QUI-GON … my only conclusion can be that it was a Sith Lord.
MACE WINDU A Sith Lord?!?
KI-ADI Impossible! The Sith have been extinct for a millennium.
"YODA The very Republic is threatened, if involved the Sith are."
MACE WINDU I do not believe they could have returned without us
knowing.
"YODA Hard to see, the dark side is. Discover who this assassin is,"
we must.
KI-ADI I sense he will reveal himself again.
"MACE WINDU This attack was with purpose, that is clear, and I"
agree the Queen is the target.
"YODA With this Naboo queen you must stay, Qui-Gon. Protect her."
MACE WINDU We will use all our resources here to unravel this
mystery and discover the identity of your attacker… May the Force be
with you.
YODA May the Force be with you.
"OBI-WAN turns to leave, but QUI-GON continues to face the Council."
YODA (Cont’d) Master Qui-Gon more to say have you?
"QUI-GON With your permission, my Master. I have encountered a"
vergence in the Force.
"YODA A vergence, you say?"
MACE WINDU Located around a person?
QUI-GON A boy… his cells have the highest concentration of midichlorians
I have seen in a life form. It is possible he was conceived by
the midi-chlorians.
MACE WINDU You’re referring to the prophesy of the one who will
bring balance to the Force… you believe it’s this boy??
QUI-GON I don’t presume…
YODA But you do! Revealed your opinion is.
QUI-GON I request the boy be tested.
The JEDI all look to one another. They nod and turn back to OBIWAN
and QUI-GON.
"YODA Trained as a Jedi, you request for him?"
QUI-GON Finding him was the will of the Force… I have no doubt of
that. There is too much happening here…
"MACE WINDU Bring him before us, then."
YODA Tested he will be.
INT. QUEENS QUARTERS – CORUSCANT – DAY
"Anakin, tentative, walks down one of the long hallways in Senator"
Palpatine’s quarters. He stops before a door that is flanked by TWO
GUARDS.
"GUARD May I help you, son?"
"ANAKIN I’m… I’m looking for the handmaiden, Padme."
The GUARD speaks into his comlink as ANAKIN looks around a bit
nervously.
GUARD The boy is here to see Padme.
RABE Send him in.
"The doors open, and ANAKIN enters the Queen’s quarters. RABE"
greets ANAKIN as TWO OTHER HANDMAIDENS come and go into
the next room.
"ANAKIN I’d like to speak with Padme, if I could."
"RABE I’m sorry, Annie. Padme is not here right now."
The Queen speaks out in the next room.
AMIDALA (O.S.) Who is it?
"RABE Anakin Skywalker, to see Padme, Your Highness."
The QUEEN moves into the doorway and studies ANAKIN. ANAKIN
"bows and looks down, then takes a peek at her."
AMIDALA I’ve sent Padme on an errand.
"ANAKIN I’m going to the Jedi temple to start my training, I hope."
The QUEEN just stares at him.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) I may not see her again… and… I just wanted to
say goodbye.
AMIDALA We will tell her for you. We’re sure her heart goes with you.
ANAKIN bows again.
"ANAKIN Thank you, Your Highness. I’m sorry to have disturbed you."
"The QUEEN disappears behind the doorway, and ANAKIN exits."
EXT. CORUSCANT – GALACTIC SENATE BUILDING – DAY (FX)
"A large, distinctive looking domed building stands out amid the"
cityscape of Coruscant.
INT. MAIN ROTUNDA – GALACTIC SENATE – DAY
The Senate chambers are huge. Thousands of SENATORS and their
AIDES sit in the circular assembly area. CHANCELLOR VALORUM
sits in an elevated area in the center. Hundreds of AIDES and
"DROIDS hurry about. SENATOR PALPATINE, QUEEN AMIDALA,"
"EIRTA, RABE, and CAPTAIN PANAKA sit in the Naboo"
"congressional box, which is actually a floating platform. PALPATINE"
leans over to the QUEEN.
PALPATINE If the Federation moves to defer the motion… Your
"Majesty, I beg of you to ask for a resolution to end this congressional"
session.
"AMIDALA I wish I had your confidence in this, Senator."
PALPATINE You must force a new election for Supreme
Chancellor… I promise you there are many who will support us… it is
"our best chance… Your Majesty, our only, chance."
AMIDALA You truly believe Chancellor Valorum will not bring our
motion to a vote?
PALAPATINE He is distracted… he is afraid. He will be of no help.
VALORUM The Chair recognizes the Senator from the sovereign
system of Naboo.
The Naboo congressional box floats into the center.
"PALPATINE Supreme Chancellor, delegates of the Senate. A tragedy"
has occurred on our peaceful system of Naboo. We have become
"caught in a dispute you’re all well aware of, which began right here"
"with the taxation of trade routes, and has now engulfed our entire"
planet in the oppression of the Trade Federation.
A second box rushes into the center of the Senate. It is filled with
"Federation trade barons led by LOTT DOD, the Senator for the"
Federation.
LOTT DOD This is outrageous! I object to the Senator’s statements!
VALORUM The Chair does not recognize the Senator from the Trade
Federation at this time. Please return to your station.
LOTT DOD reluctantly moves back to his place.
"PALPATINE To state our allegations, I present Queen Amidala, the"
"recently elected ruler of Naboo, to speak on our behalf."
QUEEN AMIDALA stands and addresses the assembly. There is
some applause.
"AMIDALA Honorable representatives of the Republic, distinguished"
"delegates, and Your Honor Supreme Chancellor Valorum, I come to"
you under the gravest of circumstances. The Naboo system has been
invaded by force. Invaded… against all the laws of the Republic by
the Droid Armies of the Trade…
LOTT DOD I object! There is no proof. This is incredible. We
recommend a commission be sent to Naboo to ascertain the truth.
VALORUM Overruled.
"LOTT DOD Your Honor, you cannot allow us to be condemned"
without reasonable observation. It’s against all the rules of procedure.
A third box representing Malastare moves into the center of the room.
"AKS MOE, the Ambassador, addresses the convention."
AKS MOE The Congress of Malastare concurs with the honorable
delegate from the Trade Federation. A commission must be
appointed… that is the law.
VALORUM The point…
VALORUM confers with several of his AIDES and VICE CHAIRMAN
MAS AMEDDA. PALPATINE whispers something to the QUEEN.
"PALPATINE Enter the bureaucrats, the true rulers of the Republic,"
"and on the payroll of the Trade Federation, I might add. This is where"
Chancellor Valorum’s strength will disappear.
VALORUM The point is conceded… Section 523A take precedence
"here. Queen Amidala of the Naboo, will you defer your motion to"
allow a commission to explore the validity of your accusations?
QUEEN AMIDALA is angry but remains composed.
AMIDALA (angrily) I will not defer… I have come before you to
resolve this attack on our sovereignty now. I was not elected to watch
my people suffer and die while you discuss this invasion in a
"committee. If this body is not capable of action, I suggest new"
leadership is needed. I move for a “vote of no confidence”… in
Chancellor Valorum’s leadership.
VALORUM What?… No!
This causes a great stir in the assembly. A loud murmur crescendos
into a roar of approval and jeers. CHANCELLOR VALORUM is
"stunned and stands speechless. His Vice Chair, MAS AMEDDA,"
takes over.
MAS AMEDDA Order! We shall have order…
Things settle down a little. The Federation box settles next to
AMIDALA. PRINCE BAIL ORGANA moves his box into the arena.
BAIL ORGANA Alderaan seconds the motion for a vote of no
confidence in Chancellor Valorum.
MAD AMEDDA The motion has been seconded by Bail Organa of
Alderaan.
"MAS AMEDDA turns to the confused VALORUM, and whispers"
something to him.
BAIL ORGANA There must be no delays. The motion is on the floor
and must be voted upon in this session.
LOTT DOD The Trade Federation moves the motion be sent to the
procedures committee for study.
The assembly begins to chant. VALORUM talks to MAS AMEDDA.
ASSEMBLY Vote now! Vote now! Vote now!
PALPATINE stands next to AMIDALA.
"PALPATINE You see, Your Majesty, the tide is with us… Valorum will"
"be voted out, I assure you, and they will elect in a new Chancellor, a"
"strong Chancellor, one who will not let our tragedy continue…"
MAS AMEDDA The Supreme Chancellor requests a recess.
Tomorrow we will begin the vote.
The Federation delegation is furious. VALORUM turns to
PALPATINE.
"VALORUM Palpatine, I thought you were my ally… my friend. You"
have betrayed me! How could you do this?
EXT. PALACE OF THE JEDI – BALCONY – SUNSET
OBI-WAN and QUI-GON stand outside the palace on a balcony.
"OBI-WAN The boy will not pass the Council’s tests, Master, and you"
know it. He is far too old.
QUI-GON Anakin will become A Jedi… I promise you.
"OBI-WAN Don’t defy the Council, Master… not again."
QUI-GON I will do what I must.
"OBI-WAN Master, you could be sitting on the Council by now if you"
would just follow the code. They will not go along with you this time.
"QUI-GON You still have much to learn, my young apprentice."
INT. PALACE OF THE JEDI – COUNCIL CHAMBERS – SUNSET
ANAKIN stands before the TWELVE JEDI. MACE WINDU holds a
"small hand-held viewing screen. In rapid succession, images flash"
across the screen.
ANAKIN A ship… a cup… a speeder.
MACE WINDU turns the viewing screen off and nods toward YODA.
"YODA Good, good, young one. How feel you?"
"ANAKIN Cold, sir."
YODA Afraid are you?
"ANAKIN No, sir."
MACE WINDU Afraid to give up your life?
ANAKIN I don’t think so.
ANAKIN hesitates for a moment.
"YODA See through you, we can."
MACE WINDU Be mindful of your feelings…
KI-ADI Your thoughts dwell on your mother.
ANAKIN I miss her.
YODA Afraid to lose her… I think.
ANAKIN (a little angry) What’s that got to do with anything?
YODA Everything. Fear is the path to the dark side… fear leads to
anger… anger leads to hate.. hate leads to suffering.
ANAKIN (angrily) I am not afraid!
"YODA A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious"
mind. I sense much fear in you.
ANAKIN (quietly) I am not afraid.
"YODA Then continue, we will."
INT. PALPATINES QUARTERS – SUNSET
"QUEEN AMIDALA is standing, staring out the window, with JAR JAR."
The lights of the city shimmer before them. EIRTAE and SABE stand
near the door. JAR JAR turns to face the QUEEN and sees her
sadness.
JAR JAR Mesa wonder why da guds invent pain?
"AMIDALA To motivate us, I imagine…"
JAR JAR Yousa tinken yousa people ganna die?
AMIDALA I don’t know.
"JAR JAR Gungans ganna get pasted too, eh?"
AMIDALA I hope not.
JAR JAR Gungans do die’n without a fight… wesa warriors. Wesa
"gotta grand army. Dat why you no liken us, metinks."
PALPATINE and CAPTAIN PANAKA rush into the room and bow
before the QUEEN.
"CAPT. PANAKA Your Highness, Senator Palpatine has been"
nominated to succeed Valorum as Supreme Chancellor.
"PALPATINE A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one. I promise,"
"Your Majesty, if I am elected, I will bring democracy back to the"
Republic. I will put an end to corruption. The Trade Federation will
"lose its influence over the bureaucrats, and our people will be freed."
AMIDALA Who else can be nominated?
CAPT. PANAKA Bail Antilles of Alderaan and Ainlee Teem of
Malastare.
PALPATINE I feel confident… our “situation” will create a strong
"sympathy vote for us… I will be Chancellor, I promise you."
"AMIDALA I fear by the time you have control of the bureaucrats,"
"Senator, there will be nothing left of our cities, our people, our way of"
life…
"PALPATINE I understand your concern, Your Majesty; unfortunately,"
the Federation has possession of our planet. The law is in their favor.
"AMIDALA With the Senate in transition, there is nothing more I can"
"do here… Senator, this is your arena. I feel I must return to mine. I"
have decided to go back to Naboo. My place is with my people.
"PALPATINE Go back!! But, Your Majesty, be realistic! You would be"
in danger. They will force you to sign the treaty.
"AMIDALA I will sign no treaty, Senator. My fate will be no different"
from that of our people. Captain!
"CAPT. PANAKA Yes, Your Highness?"
AMIDALA Ready my ship!
"CAPT. PANAKA Please, Your Majesty, stay here… where it’s safe."
"AMIDALA No place is safe, if the Senate doesn’t condemn this"
invasion. It is clear to me now that the Republic no longer functions
"as a democracy. If you win the election, Senator, I know you will do"
everything possible to stop the Federation. I pray you will bring sanity
and compassion back to the Senate.
AMIDALA and her RETINUE exit the room. PALPATINE has a selfsatisfied
smile on his face.
INT. TEMPLE OF THE JEDI – COUNCIL CHAMBERS – TWILIGHT
"ANAKIN, OBI-WAN, and QUI-GON stand before the TWELVE"
MEMBERS OF THE JEDI COUNCIL.
"YODA … Correct you were, Qui-Gon."
MACE WINDU His cells contain a high concentration of midichlorians.
KI-ADI The Force is strong with him.
"QUI-GON He’s to be trained, then."
The COUNCIL MEMBERS look to one another.
MACE WINDU No. He will not be trained.
ANAKIN is crestfallen; tears begin to form in his eyes.
QUI-GON No??!!
OBI-WAN smiles.
MACE WINDU He is too old. There is already too much anger in him.
QUI-GON He is the chosen one… you must see it.
"YODA Clouded, this boy’s future is. Masked by his youth."
"QUI-GON I will train him, then. I take Anakin as my Padawan learner."
OBI-WAN reacts with surprise. ANAKIN watches with interest.
"YODA An apprentice, you have, Qui-Gon. Impossible, to take on a"
second.
MACE WINDU We forbid it.
QUI-GON Obi-Wan is ready…
OBI-WAN I am ready to face the trials.
"YODA Ready so early, are you? What know you of ready?"
ANAKIN watches as QUI-GON and OBI-WAN exchange angry looks.
QUI-GON Headstrong… and he has much to learn about the living
"Force, but he is capable. There is little more he will learn from me."
"YODA Our own council we will keep on who is ready. More to learn,"
he has…
MACE WINDU Now is not the time for this… the Senate is voting for
"a new Supreme Chancellor. Queen Amidala is returning home, which"
"will put pressure on the Federation, and could widen the"
confrontation.
YODA And draw out the Queen’s attacker.
KI-ADI Events are moving fast… too fast.
MACE WINDU Go with the Queen to Naboo and discover the identity
of the dark warrior. That is the clue we need to unravel this mystery of
the Sith.
YODA Young Skywalker’s fate will be decided later.
QUI-GON I brought Anakin here; he must stay in my charge. He has
nowhere else to go.
"MACE WINDU He is your ward, Qui-Gon… we will not dispute that."
"YODA Train him not. Take him with you, but train him not!"
"MACE WINDU Protect the Queen, but do not intercede if it comes to"
war until we have the Senate’s approval.
YODA May the Force be with you.
"OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, and ANAKIN leave."
EXT. CORUSCANT – SENATE LANDING PLATFORM – NIGHT
"QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, and ANAKIN stand on the landing platform"
outside the ship. ARTOO whistles a happy tune as he leans over the
"edge of the platform, watching the traffic. Suddenly, he leans over too"
"far and falls overboard. After a moment, he reappears, using his onboard"
jets to propel himself back onto the landing platform. The wind
whips at ANAKIN as he listens to the JEDI.
"OBI-WAN It is not disrespect, Master, it is the truth."
QUI-GON From your point of view…
OBI-WAN The boy is dangerous… they all sense it. Why can’t you?
"QUI-GON His fate is uncertain, not dangerous. The Council will"
decide Anakin’s future… that should be enough for you. Now get on
board!
OBI-WAN reluctantly boards the Naboo spacecraft followed by
ARTOO. QUI-GON goes over to ANAKIN.
"ANAKIN Master Qui-Gon, sir, I do not wish to be a problem."
"QUI-GON You won’t be, Annie… I’m not allowed to train you, so I"
"want you to watch me and be mindful… always remember, your focus"
determines your reality. Stay close to me and you will be safe.
"ANAKIN Master, sir… I’ve been wondering… what are midichlorians?"
QUI-GON Midi-chlorians are a microscopic lifeform that reside within
all living cells and communicates with the Force.
ANAKIN They live inside of me?
QUI-GON In your cells. We are symbionts with the midi-chlorians.
ANAKIN Symbionts?
QUI-GON Life forms living together for mutual advantage. Without the
"midi-chlorians, life could not exist, and we would have no knowledge"
"of the Force. They continually speak to you, telling you the will of the"
Force.
ANAKIN They do??
"QUI-GON When you learn to quiet your mind, you will hear them"
speaking to you.
ANAKIN I don’t understand.
"QUI-GON With time and training, Annie… you will."
"Two taxis pull up, and CAPTAIN PANAKA, SENATOR PALPATINE,"
"TWENTY OR SO TROOPS, GUARDS, and OFFICERS walk briskly"
"toward the ship, followed by QUEEN AMIDALA, PADME, EIRTAE,"
"and finally, JAR JAR. AMIDALA and her HANDMAIDENS stop before"
the JEDI.
"QUI-GON (Cont’d) Your Highness, it is our pleasure to continue to"
serve and protect you.
AMIDALA I welcome your help. Senator Palpatine fears the
Federation means to destroy me.
"QUI-GON I promise you, I will not let that happen."
"AMIDALA enters the ship, followed by her HANDMAIDENS. JAR JAR"
hugs QUI-GON and ANAKIN.
JAR JAR Wesa goen home!
They ALL move onto the ship. The ship takes off.
INT. NABOO PALACE – THRONE ROOM – THEED – NIGHT
NUTE and RUNE stand before a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS.
DARTH SIDIOUS The Queen is on her way to you. I regret she is of
"no further use to us. When she gets there, destroy her."
"NUTE Yes, my Lord."
"DARTH SIDIOUS Viceroy, is the planet secure?"
"NUTE Yes, my Lord, we have taken over the last pockets of primitive"
life forms. We are in complete control of the planet now.
"DARTH SIDIOUS Good. I will see to it that in the Senate, things stay"
as they are. I am sending Darth Maul to join you. He will deal with the
Jedi.
"NUTE Yes, my Lord."
DARTH SIDIOUS fades off.
RUNE A Sith lord here with us?!!
INT. SPACE – NABOO SPACECRAFT COCKPIT
"ANAKIN stands next to the PILOT, RIC OLIE, pointing to various"
buttons and gauges.
ANAKIN … and that one?
RIC OLIE The forward stabalizer.
ANAKIN And those control the pitch?
RIC OLIE You catch on pretty quick.
INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT – QUEEN’S CHAMBERS
SABE and EIRTAE stand behind QUEEN AMIDALA as she talks with
QUI-GON and CAPTAIN PANAKA. OBI-WAN and JAR JAR watch.
"CAPT. PANAKA The moment we land the Federation will arrest you,"
and force you to sign the treaty.
QUI-GON I agree… I’m not sure what you hope to accomplish by
this.
AMIDALA I’m going to take back what’s ours.
"CAPT. PANAKA There are only twelve of us, Your Highness… we"
have no army.
"QUI-GON I cannot fight a war for you, Your Highness, only protect"
you.
AMIDALA Jar Jar Binks!
"JAR JAR looks around, puzzled."
"JAR JAR Mesa, Your Highness?"
AMIDALA Yes. I need your help.
INT. NABOO CRUISER COCKPIT – DAY
The Naboo Cruiser heads toward the lush green planet. There is only
one Federation battle cruiser orbiting. OBI-WAN and CAPTAIN
PANAKA spot it on the view screen.
PANAKA The blockade’s gone.
OBI-WAN The war’s over… No need for it now.
RIC OLIE I have one battleship on my scope.
OBI-WAN A droid control ship.
PANAKA They’ve probably spotted us.
OBI-WAN We haven’t much time.
INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT – MAIN HOLD
"The QUEEN, CAPTAIN PANAKA, TROOPS, and HANDMAIDENS"
get ready to disembark as the ship lands. The elevator door slides
"open, and ANAKIN emerges into the hold area. He see PADME and"
run up to her.
ANAKIN Hi! Where have you been?
PADME Annie! What are you doing here?
ANAKIN I’m with Qui-Gon… but… they’re not going to let me be a
Jedi. I’m too old.
"PADME This is going to be dangerous, Annie."
ANAKIN Is it? I can help… Where are we going?
"PADME To war, I’m afraid. The Queen has had to make the most"
"difficult decision of her life. She doesn’t believe in fighting, Annie. We"
are a peaceful people…
ANAKIN I want to help… I’m glad you’re back.
ANAKIN smiles. PADME smiles back.
EXT. NABOO SWAMP – DAY
The Naboo spacecraft has landed in the Gungan swamp. TROOPS
unload the ships in the background as OBI-WAN approaches QUIGON.
"OBI-WAN Jar Jar is on his way to the Gungan city, Master."
QUI-GON’s thoughts are elsewhere.
QUI-GON Good.
OBI-WAN and QUI-GON stand silently for a moment.
OBI-WAN Do you think the Queen’s idea will work?
"QUI-GON The Gungans will not easily be swayed, and we cannot"
use our power to help her.
"OBI-WAN I’m… I’m sorry for my behavior, Master. It is not my place"
to disagree with you about the boy. I am grateful you think I am ready
for the trials.
QUI-GON looks at him for a long moment.
QUI-GON You have been a good apprentice. You are much wiser
"than I am, Obi-Wan. I foresee you will become a great Jedi Knight."
EXT. NABOO SWAMP – UNDERWATER – DAY (FX)
JAR JAR swims down into Bubble City.
INT. OTOH GUNGA – CITY SQUARE
"JAR JAR enters the main square of the bubble city. He stands,"
"stunned, in amazement and fear. He is nervous and shaking."
JAR JAR Ello! Where das everybody?
The plaza is empty. He notices that many of the buildings are shot up
as if there had been a battle of some kind.
EXT. NABOO SWAMP LAKE – DAY
"JAR JAR exits the swamp lake and walks over to QUEEN AMIDALA,"
"CAPTAIN PANAKA, OBI-WAN, and QUI-GON. PADME, EIRTAE,"
"RABE, ANAKIN, and ARTOO, FOUR PILOTS, and EIGHT GUARDS"
stand in the background near the starship.
"JAR JAR Dare-sa nobody dare. All gone. Some kinda fight, I tink."
"Sorry, no Gungas… no Gungas."
CAPT. PANAKA Do you think they have been taken to camps?
OBI-WAN More likely they were wiped out.
"JAR JAR No… mesa no tink so. Gungan hiden. When in trouble, go"
to sacred place. Mackineeks no find them dare.
QUI-GON Do you know where they are?
EXT. NABOO SWAMP – DAY
The GROUP follows JAR JAR as he moves through the swamp. JAR
JAR stops and sniffs the air. The GROUP stop behind him.
JAR JAR Dissen it.
"JAR JAR makes a strange chattering noise. Suddenly, out of"
"nowhere, CAPTAIN TARPALS and SIX OTHER GUNGAN TROOPS"
riding on KAADUS emerge from the brush.
"JAR JAR (Cont’d) Heyo-dalee, Captain Tarpals."
CAPT. TARPALS Binks!! Noah gain!
JAR JAR We comen to see da boss.
CAPTIAN TARPALS rolls his eyes.
"CAPT. TARPALS Ouch time, Binks… Ouch time for all-n youse."
EXT. NABOO SACRED TEMPLE RUINS – DAY
"JAR JAR, QUEEN AMIDALA, ANAKIN, ARTOO, QUI-GON, OBIWAN,"
"PADME, RABE, EIRTAE, and the rest of her group are led"
through a clearing full of GUNGAN refugees. At the far end are the
ruins of a grand temple with massive carved heads. BOSS NASS and
several other COUNCIL MEMBERS walk out on the top of a threequarter-
submerged head.
"BOSS NASS Jar Jar, yousa payen dis time. Who’s da uss-en"
others??
QUEEN AMIDALA steps forward. CAPTAIN PANAKA and the JEDI
stand behind her.
AMIDALA I am Queen Amidala of the Naboo… I come before you in
peace.
BOSS NASS Naboo biggen. Yousa bringen da Mackineeks… Dya
"busten uss-en omm. Yousa all bombad. Yousa all die’n, mesa tink."
CAPTAIN PANAKA and HALF A DOZEN GUARDS and PILOTS look
"around nervously, and the GUNGAN TROOPS lower their long power"
poles. The JEDI stay relaxed. ANAKIN watches everything with great
interest.
AMIDALA We wish to form an alliance…
"Suddenly, PADME steps forward."
PADME Your Honor…
ARTOO whistles a quiet “uh oh.”
BOSS NASS Whosa dis?
PADME I am Queen Amidala. (points to Queen) This is my decoy…
my protection… my loyal bodyguard.
ANAKIN is stunned. OBI-WAN and QUI-GON give each other a
knowing look.
"PADME (Cont’d) … I am sorry for my deception, but under the"
circumstances it has become necessary to protect myself. Although
"we do not always agree, Your Honor, our two great societies have"
always lived in peace… until now. The Trade Federation has
"destroyed all that we have worked so hard to build. You are in hiding,"
"my people are in camps. If we do not act quickly, all will be lost"
"forever… I ask you to help us… no, I beg you to help us."
PADME drops to her knees and prostrates herself before BOSS
"NASS. There is a gasp from CAPTAIN PANAKA, HIS TROOPS, and"
the HANDMAIDENS.
PADME (Cont’d) We are your humble servants… our fate is in your
hands.
"Slowly, CAPTAIN PANAKA and his TROOPS bow down before the"
"GUNGAN COUNCIL. Then the HANDMAIDENS, ANAKIN, and finally"
the JEDI. The GUNGANS are puzzled by this. BOSS NASS begins to
laugh.
BOSS NASS Yousa no tinken yousa greater den da Gungans.. Mesa
like dis. Maybe wesa bein friends.
INT. NABOO PALACE – THRONE ROOM – DAY
"NUTE, RUNE, and DARTH MAUL walk with a hologram of DARTH"
SIDIOUS.
NUTE … we’ve sent out patrols. We’ve already located their starship
"in the swamp… It won’t be long, My Lord."
DARTH SIDIOUS This is an unexpected move for her. It’s too
"aggressive.. Lord Maul, be mindful."
"DARTH MAUL Yes, my Master."
DARTH SIDIOUS Be patient… Let them make the first move.
EXT. NABOO EDGE OF SWAMP/ GRASS PLAINS – DAY
"A GUNGAN SENTRY sits on top of the ancient temple head,"
searching the landscape with a pair of electrobinoculars. He sees
something and yells down to ANAKIN at the foot of the statue.
GUNGAN LOOKOUT Daza comen!
ANAKIN All right. They’re here!
"ANAKIN yells and runs over to PADME and the JEDI, who are"
discussing a battle plan with FIVE GUNGAN GENERALS. SABE and
EIRTAE stand nearby. BOSS NASS puts his arm around JAR JAR.
BOSS NASS Yousa doen grand. Jar Jar bringen da Naboo together.
"JAR JAR Oh, no, no, no…"
"BOSS NASS So, wesa maken yousa Bombad General."
"JAR JAR General??! Oh, no.."
"JAR JAR’s eyes roll back, his tongue flops out and he faints. FOUR"
SPEEDERS pull up to the GROUP. CAPTAIN PANAKA and a
DOZEN OR SO GUARDS and PILOT pile out and join the group.
PADME What is the situation?
CAPT. PANAKA Almost everyone’s in camps. A few hundred police
and guards have formed an underground movement. I brought as
many of the leaders as I could. The Federation Army’s also much
"larger than we thought, and much stronger. Your Highness, this is a"
battle I do not think we can win.
PADME The battle is a diversion. The Gungans must draw the Droid
Army away from the cities. We can enter the city using the secret
"passages on the waterfall side. Once we get to the main entrance,"
"Captain Panaka will create a diversion, so that we can enter the"
"palace and capture the Viceroy. Without the Viceroy, they will be lost"
and confused.
QUI-GON and OBI-WAN look on with interest.
"PADME (Cont’d) What do you think, Master Jedi?"
QUI-GON The Viceroy will be well guarded.
CAPT. PANAKA The difficulty’s getting into the throne room. Once
"we’re inside, we shouldn’t have a problem."
QUI-GON There is a possibility with this diversion many Gungans will
be killed.
BOSS NASS Wesa ready to do are-sa part.
JAR JAR smiles a very worried and sheepish grin. ANAKIN watches
"with interest, as does ARTOO."
PADME We have a plan which should immobilize the Droid Army. We
will send what pilots we have to knock out the Droid control ship
"which is orbiting the planet. If we can get past their rayshields, we"
can sever communication and their droids will be helpless.
"QUI-GON A well-conceived plan. However, there’s great risk. The"
weapons on your fighters may not penetrate the shields on the
control ship.
"OBI-WAN And there’s an even bigger danger. If the Viceroy escapes,"
"Your Highness, he will return with another droid army."
PADME That is why we must not fail to get to the Viceroy. Everything
depends on it.
INT. THEED – PALACE – THRONE ROOM – DAY
"NUTE, RUNE, DARTH MAUL, OOM-9, and a hologram of DARTH"
SIDIOUS walk through the throne room.
DARTH SIDIOUS … she is more foolish than I thought.
NUTE We are sending all available troops to meet this army of hers
assembling near the swamp. It appears to be made up of primitives.
We do not expect much resistance.
OOM-9 I am increasing security at all Naboo detention camps.
"DARTH MAUL I feel there is more to this, My Master. The two Jedi"
may be using the Queen for their own purposes.
DARTH SIDIOUS The Jedi cannot become involved. They can only
protect the Queen. Even Qui-Gon Jinn will not break that covenant…
This will work to our advantage…
"NUTE I have your approval to proceed then, My Lord."
DARTH SIDIOUS Proceed. Wipe them put… all of them.
INT. NABOO SWAMP LAKE – DAY (FX)
All is peaceful. SMALL CRITTERS drink out of a large swamp lake.
Suddenly there is a disturbance in the middle of the lake. A rush of
"bubbles, then a GUNGAN SOLDIER riding a KAADU emerges from"
"the water, followed by SEVERAL OTHERS. FROGS and OTHER"
LITTLE ANIMALS flee in all directions as the GUNGAN ARMY
marches through the swamp. The KAADU shake themselves off as
"they exit the lake. When JAR JAR’s KAADU shakes off, JAR JAR"
"falls off. SOLDIERS on huge, lizard-like FAMBAAS with large shield"
generators mounted on their backs follow the marching WARRIORS.
The GUNGAN ARMY heads out of the swamp and onto the rolling
grassy hills. HUNDREDS OF GUNGAN WARRIORS march in long
lines toward the horizon. Federation tanks move up to a ridge and
stop. In the distance they see the GUNGAN ARMY marching toward
them. The GUNGAN GENERAL CEEL sees the tanks on the ridge
and orders a halt. The GUNGANS are spread out in a large line. JAR
JAR is nervous. GENERAL CEEL signals to the shield operators.
GENERAL CEEL Energize the shields.
A red ray shoots out of the generator and blasts into a large dish on
the back of a second FAAMBA and spreads like an umbrella over the
assembled WARRIORS.
EXT. THEED – CENTRAL PLAZA – DAY
"PADME, followed by EIRTAE, OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, ANAKIN, and"
"ARTOO, stealthily makes her way toward the entrance to the main"
"hanger. They are followed by about TWENTY NABOO GUARDS,"
"PILOTS, and TROOPS. They stop, and PADME uses a small red"
"laser light to signal across the plaza to CAPTAIN PANAKA, RABE"
and TWENTY OTHER ASSORTED NABOO TROOPS. They signal
back. QUI-GON leans over to ANAKIN.
"QUI-GON Once we get inside, Annie, you find a safe place to hide"
and stay there.
ANAKIN Sure.
QUI-GON And stay there!
DROID TROOPS mill about the tank-filled plaza. At the far end of the
"plaza, SEVERAL DROIDS begin to run and fire. NABOO SOLDIERS"
begin to fire back at the BATTLE DROIDS. As the ruckus erupts at
"one end of the plaza, PADME and her TROOPS rush into the main"
hanger. CAPTAIN PANAKA and HIS SOLDIERS continue to engage
the DROIDS outside.
INT. THEED – CENTRAL HANGER – DAY
"ALARMS ARE SOUNDING a PADME, the JEDI, ANAKIN, EIRTAE,"
and PADME’s TROOPS rush into the hanger. BATTLE DROIDS
begin firing at them as they run for cover. ANAKIN runs under a
Naboo fighter. The JEDI deflect bolts aimed at PADME back onto the

EXT. NABOO GRASS PLAINS – DAY (FX)
"The Federation tanks begin to fire on the GUNGANS, but they are"
"protected by their energy shield. The tanks stop firing, and the"
"GUNGANS CHEER, until they see the doors to the massive"
"transports open, and racks of BATTLE DROIDS are pulled out and"
lined up by a squad of STAPS. The BATTLE DROIDS reconfigure
into their standing position. The GUNGANS get ready for an attack.
"OOM-9 gives the command to move forward, and THOUSANDS OF"
DROIDS march toward the GUNGANS. The GUNGANS power up
their weapons. The DROIDS slowly march through the protective
shield and start firing. The GUNGANS throw their power poles and
fling small balls of energy with slingshots. The WARRIORS dump
large balls of energy into mortars that heat up and fire the energy goo
"onto the BATTLE DROIDS, causing them to short out. The battle"
rages and the GUNGANS defend their shield generators against the
ARMY OF DROIDS. OOM-9 watches from a tank on a hill
overlooking the battle.
INT. THEED – CENTRAL HANGER – DAY
"ANAKIN hides behind one of the Naboo fighters, ducking as large"
bolts whiz past and EXPLODE near him. PADME and the TWO JEDI
destroy BATTLE DROIDS right and left. The QUEEN’S TROOPS and
EIRTAE also blast away at the DROIDS. PADME signals to her
pilots.
PADME Get to your ships!
The PILOTS and ARTOO UNITS run for the Naboo fighter craft
stacked in the hanger bay. ONE OF THE PILOTS jumps into a fighter
right above where ANAKIN is hiding.
"FIGHTER PILOT Better find a new hiding place, kid. I’m taking this"
ship.
The ship begins to levitate out of the hanger. BATTLE DROIDS fire at
it as it falls in behind five other fighters. ARTOO whistles to ANAKIN
from a second fighter not far away. ANAKIN runs and jumps into the
second fighter to hide.
EXT. THEED – CENTRAL PLAZA – DAY (FX)

EXPLODE.
INT. THEED – CENTRAL HANGER – DAY
"CAPTAIN PANAKA, SABE and NABOO TROOPS rush into the"
hanger and overwhelm the few remaining BATTLE DROIDS.
"PADME, OBI-WAN, and QUI-GON join forces with CAPTAIN"
PANAKA.
PADME My guess is the Viceroy is in the throne room.
She looks to QUI-GON.
QUI-GON I agree.
"They start to head for the exit, on the way passing the fighter where"
ANAKIN is hiding. ARTOO whistles a greeting as ANAKIN peeps out
of the cockpit.
ANAKIN Hey! Wait for me.
"QUI-GON No, Annie, you stay there. Stay right where you are."
"ANAKIN But, I…"
QUI-GON Stay in that cockpit.
"They head for the exit. As they are about to go through the door,"
"suddenly everyone scatters, revealing DARTH MAUL standing in the"
"doorway. CAPTAIN PANAKA, PADME, and HER TROOPS back"
away. QUI-GON and OBI-WAN step forward.
QUI-GON (Cont’d) We’ll’ handle this…
The TWO JEDI take off their capes and ignite their laser swords.
"DARTH MAUL takes off his cape, and ignites his laser sword. Both"
"ends of the sword light up. At the far end of the hanger, SIX WHEEL"
DROIDS roll in and transform into their battle position. ARTOO calls
ANAKIN’s attention to the DROIDS. The JEDI begin to fight the Sith
Lord.
"ANAKIN Oh, no…"
The DROIDS begin to advance and start firing on PADME and HER
TROOPS.
"ANAKIN (Cont’d) We gotta do something, Artoo."
"ARTOO whistles a reply. Suddenly, the ship’s systems go on, and the"
ship begins to levitate.
"ANAKIN (Cont’d) All right, thanks Artoo! Great idea! I’ll take over."
Let’s see…
"ANAKIN steers the ship toward the DROIDS. He pushes a button,"
and the ship begins to shake.
"ANAKIN (Cont’d) Where’s the trigger? Oops, wrong one.. Maybe this"
one…
"ANAKIN pushes a second button, and the lasers begin to fire, wiping"
out several DESTROYER DROIDS. ARTOO whistles a cheer.
"ANAKIN (Cont’d) Yeah, all right. “Droid blaster.” Yeah!"
The JEDI are engaged in a fierce sword fight with DARTH MAUL.
They have moved into the center of the hanger. While the WHEEL
"DROIDS are momentarily distracted by ANAKIN, CAPTAIN PANAKA,"
"PADME, and HER TROOPS exit into a palace hallway. The WHEEL"
DROIDS start firing at ANAKIN. There are EXPLOSIONS all around
him.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) Oops… shield up! Always on the right… shields
always on the right.
"ANAKIN flips several switches, and the after-burner ignites."
ANAKIN (Cont’d) I know we’re moving. I’ll shut the energy drive
down.
The fighter rockets out of the hanger. ARTOO and ANAKIN hold on
for dear life.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) Oops!! Wrong one.
ARTOO beeps.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) I’m not doing anything!
ARTOO beeps.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) I know… I didn’t push anything.
The SITH LORD’s moves are incredible. He is fighting the TWO JEDI
"at once, flipping into the air, outmaneuvering them at every turn."

The fleet approaches the space station. Many Federation fighters exit
the hangers and attack.
RIC OLIE Enemy fighters straight ahead!
EXT. NABOO GRASS PALINS – DAY
JAR JAR’s clumsiness works for him in the battle. He gets caught up
"in the wiring of a blasted DROID, dragging the torso around with him,"
"the DROID’s gun firing randomly, accidentally blasting SEVERAL"
DROIDS in one process. OOM-9 decides to send in the WHEEL
DROIDS and gives the signal. HUNDREDS OF WHEEL DROIDS roll
out of the transports and head down toward the battle. They slowly
"roll through the deflector shields, then transform themselves once"
they get on the other side. The GUNGANS blast the WHEEL
DROIDS with energy balls. The DESTROYER DROIDS blast many
GUNGANS.
INT. NABOO STARFIGHTER – COCKPIT – SPACE
A giant dogfight ensues. ANAKIN’s fighter flies into space above
Naboo. ARTOO beeps a worried concern.
ANAKIN The Autopilot is searching for what other ships?
ARTOO beeps and whistles.
"ANAKIN (Cont’d) There is no manual override, Artoo. You’ll have to"
rewire it or something.
ARTOO chirps that he’s trying.
ANAKIN (cont’d) Look! There they are! That’s where the autopilot is
taking us.
ANAKIN’s fighter flies toward the Federation Battleship.

EXT. THEED – PALACE – OVER WATERFALL – DAY
"PADME, CAPTAIN PANAKA, and about TEN OTHER NABOO"
SOLDIERS are lined up along the edge. They have pulled small

JAR JAR tries to run from the BATTLE DROIDS.
GENERAL CEEL Retreat! Retreat!
"The GUNGANS begin to turn and run, on foot, on their kaadu, and in"
wagons. JAR JAR attempts to escape on a wagon of energy balls but
"only manages to unhitch the back gate, causing all of the energy balls"
to roll out of the wagon and down the hill. JAR JAR scrambles to
avoid being hit by one of the balls. FOUR DESTROYER DROIDS
aren’t so lucky. They get blasted by the energy balls. The GUNGANS
renew their attack on the DROID ARMY. JAR JAR’s bumbling
destroys several more DESTROYER DROIDS.
INT. NABOO STARFIGHTER – COCKPIT -SPACE
ANAKIN finds himself in the middle of the space battle. A ship
explodes behind him (over his left shoulder).
"ANAKIN Whoo, boy! This is tense!"
He looks forward to see enemy ships approaching head on.
"ANAKN (Cont’d) Oops! Artoo, get us off Autopilot!"
ARTOO screams a reply.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) I’ve got control?
ANAKIN flips switches.
"ANAKIN (Cont’d) Okay, let’s go left!"
"He moves the controls left and the ship responds, turning left."
"ANAKIN (Cont’d) Yes… I’ve got control. You did it, Artoo!"
ARTOO beeps
ANAKIN (Cont’d) Go back!?! Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit
and that’s what I’m gonna do. Now c’mon!
An enemy fighter comes into his sights. ANAKIN pushes the controls
"and instead of firing, his fighter accelerates past the enemy ship."
ANAKIN (Cont’d) Oops! Whoa!
Now the enemy ship is on his tail. He tries evasive maneuvers.
"ANAKIN (Cont’d) I’ll try spinning, that’s a good trick."
ANAKIN rolls the ship as ARTOO screams desperately.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) I know we’re in trouble! Hang on! The way out of
this mess is the way we got into it.
ARTOO beeps a reply.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) Which one? This one?
ANAKIN yanks on the reverse thrusters and the ship slows instantlythe

station.
INT. NABOO STARFIGHTER – COCKPIT – SPACE
The SQUADRON attacks the space station.

"BRAVO TWO Roger, Bravo Leader."
The attack is fruitless.

it.
"Meanwhile, ANAKIN is being chased by another fighter. ARTOO"
shrieks.
"ANAKIN I know, Artoo! This isn’t Podracing!"
"The enemy ship fires and hits ANAKIN’s fighter, sending it into a spin."
ARTOO screams.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) We’re hit!
ANAKIN regains control as his ship enters the space station hanger.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) Great gobs of bantha poo-doo!
ANAKIN’s ship dodges parked transport ships and other obstacles. A
huge bulkhead blocks his way. ARTOO beeps.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) I’m trying to stop! I’m trying to stop! Whoa!
ANAKIN hits the reverse thrusters and the ship skids to a stop on the
hanger deck. ARTOO gives out a worried whistle.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) All right! All right! Get the system started!
ANAKIN ducks down to adjust a control panel.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) Everything’s overheated. All the lights are red.
"ARTOO sees DROIDS approaching, and beeps frantically."
INT. THEED – POWER GENERATOR PIT – DAY
The laser sword battle continues on the small catwalk around the vast
power pit. DARTH MAUL kicks OBI-WAN off one of the ramps and he
falls several levels. QUI-GON knocks the DARK LORD off another
"ramp, and he lands hard on a ramp two levels below. QUI-GON"
jumps down after him. The DARK LORD backs away along the
catwalk into a small door. QUI-GON follows as OBI-WAN runs to
catch up.
INT. THEED – POWER GENERATOR ELECRIC BEAM –
HALLWAY
"The SITH LORD, followed by QUI-GON, enters a long hallway filled"
with a series of deadly rays that go on and off in a pulsing pattern that
shoots down the corridor every minute or so. DARTH MAUL makes it
down several walls of deadly rays before they close. QUI-GON is one
wall away from the DARK LORD. OBI-WAN is just starting into it and
is five walls way from DARTH MAUL. The JEDI must wait until the
next pulse to advance down the corridor. OBI-WAN is impatient and
"paces, waiting for the wall of rays to open. QUI-GON sits and"
meditates. The SITH LORD tries to patch up his wounds.
INT. THEED – PALACE – HALLWAY TO THRONE ROOM
"A window in the hallway blasts apart. PADME, CAPTAIN PANAKA,"
and HER SOLDIERS climb into the hallway. They head for the door
"to the throne room. Suddenly, two DESTROYER DROIDS skitter in"
front of the door. PADME turns around and sees TWO MORE appear
"at the far end of the hallway, trapping them in the middle. PADME"
throws down her pistol and turns to CAPTAIN PANAKA.
PADME Throw down your weapons. They win this round.
CAPT. PANAKA But we can’t…
"PADME Captain, I said throw down your weapons."
CAPTAIN PANAKA and HIS MEN throw down their weapons.
EXT. NABOO GRASS PLAINS – DAY

it to EXPLODE. The protective shield begins to weaken and fall apart.
OOM-9 sees the shield weaken and orders his tanks forward. The
GUNGAN GENERAL signals a retreat as the tanks enter the battle.
The GUNGANS flee as fast as they can. JAR JAR is blown off his
KAADU and lands on one of the tank guns. A GUNGAN WARRIOR
signals JAR JAR to jump off. JAR JAR is afraid. The gun swings
around trying to knock JAR JAR off. JAR JAR hangs from the tank
"barrel as it moves along. Finally, he jumps onto a KAADU behind a"
GUNGAN WARRIOR. EXPLOSIONS from the tank fire are
everywhere. It is chaos.
INT. THEED – POWER GENERATOR ELECTRIC BEAM –
HALLWAY
The electric rays cycle as QUI-GON sits meditating. The wall of the
"deadly rays turn away, and OBI-WAN starts running toward QUIGON"
and the DARK LORD. When the wall between QUI-GON and
"DARTH MAUL opens, QUI-GON is in a split second fighting the"
DARK LORD with a ferocity not seen before. They move into the area
"at the end of the corridor called the melting pit, a small area that is"
mostly made up of a deep hole. The electron ray gates begin to
close. OBI-WAN tries to make it to the melting pit but is caught one
gate short. He slides to a stop just before he hits the deadly electron
field. QUI-GON and DARTH MAUL battle around the melting pit as a
frustrated OBI-WAN watches. DARTH MAUL catches QUI-GON off
"guard. The SITH makes a quick move, bashes his lightsaber handle"
"into QUI-GON’s chin, and runs him through. QUI-GON slumps to the"
floor in a heap.
EXT. NABOO GRASS PLAINS – DAY
"The GUNGANS have been overrun. Some flee into the hills, chased"
by BATTLE DROIDS on STAPS. Many OTHERS are herded into

brought by TEN BATTLE DROIDS before NUTE and RUNE and
FOUR NEIMOIDIAN COUNCIL MEMBERS.
"NUTE Your little insurrection is at an end, Your Highness. Time for"
you to sign the treaty… and end this pointless debate in the Senate.
SADBE dressed like the Queen appears in the doorway with
SEVERAL TROOPS. Several destroyed battle droids can be seen in
the distance.
"SABE I will not be signing any treaty, Viceroy, because you’ve lost!"
NUTE and THE OTHERS are stunned to see a SECOND QUEEN.
NUTE yells at the TEN GUARDS in the room.
NUTE After her! This one is a decoy!
SIX OF THE DROIDS rush out of the throne room after SABE. NUTE
turns to PADME.
NUTE (Cont’d) Your Queen will not get away with this.
PADME slumps down on her throne and immediately hits a security
button that opens a panel in her desk opposite CAPTAIN PANAKA.
"PADME grabs two pistols, tosses one of the to CAPTAIN PANAKA"
and one to an OFFICER. She takes a third pistol and BLASTS the
last of the BATTLE DROIDS. The OFFICERS rush to the door control
panel as PADME hits the switch to close the door. The OFFICER at
the door jams the controls. CAPTAIN PANAKA throws more pistols to
the OTHER GUARDS. The NEIMODIANS are confused and afraid.
"PADME Now, Viceroy, this is the end of your occupation here."
NUTE Don’t be absurd. There are too few of you. It won’t be long
before hundreds of destroyer droids break in to rescue us.
INT. THEED – POWER GENERATOR – MELTING PIT
"OBI-WAN screams as the pulsing electron gate opens, and the SITH"
LORD attacks him. The DARK LORD is relentless in his assault on
the young JEDI. OBI-WAN and DARTH MAUL use the Force to fling
objects at each other as they fight. DARTH MAUL seems to have the
upper hand as OBI-WAN grows weary. DARTH MAUL catches OBIWAN
"off guard, and the JEDI slips into a melting pit. He is barely able"
to hold onto a nozzle on the side of the pit. DARTH MAUL grin evilly
at OBI-WAN as he kicks OBI-WAN’s lightsaber down the endless
shaft. The SITH LORD smiles as he goes in for the kill. At the last
"moment, OBI-WAN jumps up out of the pit, calls QUI-GON’s"
"lightsaber to hi, throwing DARTH MAUL off. The young JEDI swings"
"with a vengeance, cutting the SITH down. DARTH MAUL falls into the"
"melting pit to his death. OBI-WAN rushes over to QUI-GON, who is"
dying.
OBI-WAN Master! Master!
QUI-GON It is too late… It’s…
OBI-WAN No!
QUI-GON Obi-Wan promise… promise me you’ll train the boy…
"OBI-WAN Yes, Master…"

ANAKIN Uh oh. This is not good.
He looks at the dashboard to see red lights.
"ANAKIN (Cont’d) The systems are still overheated, Artoo."
The BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN walks up to the ship and sees
ARTOO.
BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN Where’s your pilot?
ARTOO beeps a reply.
BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN (Cont’d) You’re the pilot?
ARTOO whistles.
BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN (Cont’d) Let me see your identification!
ANAKIN sees the dashboard lights go from red to green.
ANAKIN Yes… we have ignition.
He flips the switch and the engine starts.
BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN (seeing Anakin) You! Come out of there
or we’ll blast you!
ANAKIN Not if I can help it! Shields up!
"ANAKIN flips a switch and the ship levitates, knocking over the"
"BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN. The OTHER DROIDS shoot, but the"
lasers are deflected by ANAKIN’s shields. ARTOO beeps.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) This should stop them.
ANAKIN fires lasers as the ship begins to rotate.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) … and take this!
He presses a button and launches two torpedoes which miss the
DROIDS.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) Darn… I missed!
The two torpedoes fly down a hallway and explode inside the reactor
room.
ANAKIN (Cont’d) Let’s get out of here!

"agree on you taking this boy as your Padawan learner, I do not."
OBI-WAN Qui-Gon believed in him. I believe in Qui-Gon.

I fear in his training.
"OBI-WAN Master Yoda, I gave Qui-Gon my word. I will train Anakin."

"reaches the foot of the ramp, when suddenly there is a blinding"
FLASH and a huge EXPLOSION. The DIGNITARIES and PILOTS
are hurled to the ground as the starship is destroyed.

Order! We shall have order! The motion for the republic to
"commission an army takes precedent, and that is what we will vote"
on at this time.
"Everything quiets down. The AIDE disperses, and SUPREME"
CHANCELLOR PALPATINE steps to the podium.
PALPATINE
"… My esteemed colleagues, excuse me… I have just received some"
tragic and disturbing news. Senator Amidala of the Naboo system…
has been assassinated!
5 CONTINUED:
There is a shock silence in the vast arena.
PALPATINE
(continuing)
This grevious blow is especially personal to me. Before I became
"Chancellor, I served Amidala when she was Queen. She was a great"
"leader who fought for justice, not only in this honorable assembly, but"
also on her home planet. She was so loved she could have been
"elected queen for life. She believed in public service, and she"
fervently believed in democracy. Her death is a great loss to us all.
We will all mourn her as a relentless champion of freedom… and as a
dear friend.
"There is a moment of silence. ASK AAK, the SENATOR of"
"MALASTARE, moves his pod into the center of the arena."
ASK AAK
How many More Senators will die before this civil strife ends! We
"must confront these rebels now, and we need an army to do it."
"A second pad moves into the center of the area with DARSANA, the"
AMBASSADOR OF GLEE ANSELM.
DARSANA
Why weren’t the Jedi able to stop this assassination? We are no
longer safe under their protection.
SENATOR ORN FREE TAA swings forward in his pod.
ORN FREE TAA
The Republic needs more security now! Before it comes to war.
PALPATINE
Must I remind the Senator from Malastare that negotiations are
continuing with the separatists. Peace is our objective here… not war.
The SENATORS yell pro and con. MAS AMEDDA tries to calm things
"down. SENATOR PADMÉ AMIDALA with CAPTAIN TYPHO, JAR"
"JAR and DORMÉ, maneuvers her pod into the center of the vast"
arena.
PADMÉ
"My noble colleagues, I concur with the Supreme Chancellor. At all"
"costs, we do not want war!"
"The Senate goes quiet, then there is an outburst of cheering and"
applause.
5 CONTINUED: (2) 5
PALPATINE
It is with with great surprise and joy the chair recognizes the Senator
"from Naboo, Padmé Amidala."
PADMÉ
"Less than an hour ago, an assassination attempt was made against"
my life. One of my bodyguards and six others were ruthlessly and
"senselessly murdered. I was the target but, more importantly, I"
"believe this security measure before you, was the target. I have led"
the opposition to build an army… but there is someone in this body
who will stop at nothing to assure its passage…
Many of the SENATORS boo and yell at SENATOR AMIDALA.
PADMÉ
(continuing)
"I warn you, if you vote to create this army, war will follow. I have"
experienced the misery of war first-hand; I do not wish to do it again.
There is sporadic yelling for and against her statements.
PADMÉ
(continuing)
"Wake up, Senators… you must wake up! If we offer the separatists"
"violence, they can only show us violence in return! Many will lose"
their lives. All will lose their freedom. This decision could very well
destroy the very foundation of our great Republic. I pray you do not
let fear push you into a disastrous decision. Vote down this security
"measure, which is nothing less than a declaration of war! Does"
anyone here want that? I cannotbelieve they do.
There is an undercurrent of booing… and groaning. SENATOR ORN
FREE TAA moves his pod next to AMIDWA.
ORN MEE TAA
My motion to defer the vote must be dealt with first. That is the rule of
law.
AMIDALA looks angry and frustrated. PALPATINE gives her a
sympathetic look.
5 CONTINUED: (3) 5
PALPATINE
"Due to the lateness of the hour and the seriousness of this motion,"
"we will take up these matters tomorrow. Until then, the Senate stands"
adjourned.
6 EXT. EXECUTIVE QUARTERS BUILDING – DAY 6
The giant towers of the Republic Executive Building seem to reach
the heavens. Traffic clogs the smoggy sky.
7 INT. CHANCELLOR’S OFFICE – DAY 7
CHANCELLOR PALPATINE sits behind his desk with TWO REDCLAD
"ROYAL GUARDS on either side of the door. YODA, PLO KIADI"
"MUNDI,"
and MACE WINDU sit across from him.
PALPATINE
"I don’t know how much longer I can hold off the vote, my friends."
More and more star systems are joining the separatists.
MACE WINDU
If they do break away -
PALPATINE
No! I will not let that happen!
MACE WINDU
"But if they do, you must realize there aren’t enough Jedi to protect the"
"Republic. We are keepers of the peace, not soldiers."
PALPATINE
"Master Yoda, do you think it will really come to war?"
YODA closes his eyes.
YODA
"Worse than war, I fear… Much worse."
PALPATINE
What?
MACE WINDU
"What do you sense, Master?"
YODA
Impossible to see… The Dark Side clouds everything. But this I am
sure of -
(opens his eyes)
Do their duty the Jedi will.
"A muted BUZZER SOUNDS. A hologram of an AIDE, DAR WAC,"
appears
on the Chancellor’s desk.
7 CONTINUED: 7
DAR WAC
"The loyalist committee has arrived, my Lord."
PALPATINE
Send them in.
"They all stand as SENATOR AMIDALA, CAPTAIN TYPHO, JAR JAR,"
"MAS AMEDDA, DORMÉ, and THREE SENATORS (BAIL ORGANA,"
"LUMINARA UNDULI, and HOROX RYYDER) enter the office. As"
"YODA and MACE WINDU move to greet the SENATOR, YODA taps"
AMIDALA with his cane.
YODA
"With you, the Force is strong… young Senator. To see you alive"
brings warm feelings to my heart.
PADMÉ
"Thank you, Master Yoda. Do you have any idea who was behind this"
attack?
MACE WINDU
"Our intelligence points to disgruntled spice miners, on the moons of"
Naboo.
PADMÉ
I don’t wish to disagree but I think that Count Dooku was behind it.
There is a stir of surprise. They look at one another.
MACE WINDU
"You know, M’Lady, Count Dooku was once a Jedi. He wouldn’t"
"assassinate anyone, it’s not in his character."
KI-ADI-MUNDI
"He is a political idealist, not a murderer."
PALPATINE
Count Dooku has always avoided any kind of conflict. It appears he
has no desire to start a war. Why would he kill you? To what end?
PADMÉ
"I don’t know, but everything in my being tells me he was behind it…"
YODA
"In dark times nothing is what it appears to be, but the fact remains"
"Senator, in grave danger you are."
"PALPATINE gets up, walks to the window, and looks out at the vast"
city.
7 CONTINUED: (2) 7
PALPATINE
"Master Jedi, may I suggest that the Senator be placed under the"
protection of your graces.
BAIL ORGANA
Do you think that is a wise use of manpower during these stressful
times?
PADMÉ
"Chancellor, if I may comment, I do not believe the…"
PALPATINE
"…”situation is that serious.” No, but I do, Senator."
PADMÉ
"Chancellor, please! I don’t want any more guards!"
PALPATINE
I realize all too well that additional security might be disruptive for
"you, but perhaps someone you are familiar with…an old friend like…"
Master Kenobi…
"PALPATINE nods to MACE WINDU, who nods back."
MACE WINDU
That’s possible. He has just returned from a border dispute on
Ansion.
PALPATINE
"You must remember him, M’Lady… hewatched over you during the"
blockade conflict.
PADMÉ
"This is not necessary, Chancellor."
PALPATINE
"Do it for me, M’Lady, please. I will rest easier. We had a big scare"
today. The thought of losing you is unbearable.
AMIDALA sighs as the JEDI get up to leave.
MACE WINDU
"I will have Obi-Wan report to you immediately, M’Lady."
YODA leans into her ear.
YODA
"Too little about yourself you worry, Senator, and too much about"
"politics. Be mindful of your danger, Padmé. Accept our help."
7 CONTINUED: (3) 7
"As the JEDI leave the office, PALPATINE continues to pace behind"
his desk.
PALPATINE
"I will not let this Republic, that has stood for over a thousand years,"
be split in two.
8 EXT. SENATE APARTMENTS – TWILIGHT 8
A graceful skyskraper twinkles in the evening light of Coruscant.
"9 INT. SENATE BUILDING, APARTMENT CORRIDOR –"
EVENING 9
The door to the apartment slides open. JAR JAR walks into the
"corridor, where TWO JEDI are exiting the elevator. He recognizes"
"OBI-WAN and becomes extremely excited, jumping around, shaking"
his hand.
JAR JAR
Obi! Obi! Obi! Mesa soo smilen to see’en yousa. Wahooooo!
OBI-WAN smiles.
OBI-WAN
"It’s good to see you, too, Jar Jar."
JAR JAR
"Oops! Weresa mesa manners? Excuse me, Master Obi-Wan. I"
completely forgot myself for a moment there. I have had to learn
"Diplodialect… speak it like a native now. Don’t really see the point,"
"actually, but members of the Senate seem to prefer it…"
JAR JAR notices OBI-WAN’S APPRENTICE.
JAR JAR
(continuing)
"…and this, I take it, is your apprentice… Noooooooo! Annie?"
Noooooooo! Little Bitty Annie?
(Looks at Anakin)
Noooooooo! Yousa so biggen! Yiyiyiyyi! Annie!! Mesa no believen!
ANAKIN
"Hi, Jar Jar."
JAR JAR grabs hold of ANAKIN and envelops him in a big hug.
JAR JAR
Annie! Annie! Yiyiyiyiyiyiiii!
"10 INT. SENATE BUILDING, APARTMENT – EVENING 10"
PADMÉ is in a conference with CAPTAIN TYPHO and DORMÉ. JAR
"JAR enters the room, followed by the TWO JEDI."
JAR JAR
"Lookie… lookie… Oops! Oh, dear, I’m afraid I’ve forgotten myself"
again.
PADMÉ and TYPHO rise as OBI-WAN and ANAKIN stop before the
SENATOR. OBI-WAN steps forward. ANAKIN stares at PADMÉ. She
glances at him.
OBI-WAN
"It’s a pleasure to see you again, M’Lady."
PADMÉ walks over to OBI-WAN and takes his hand in hers.
PADMÉ
"It has been far too long, Master Kenobi. I’m so glad our paths have"
crossed again… but I must warn you that I think your presence here
is unnecessary.
OBI-WAN
I’m sure the Jedi Council has their reasons.
She moves in front of ANAKIN.
PADMÉ
Annie??
(stares)
"My goodness, you’ve grown."
They look at each other for a long moment.
ANAKIN
(trying to be smooth)
"So have you… grown more beautiful, I mean… and much shorter…"
"for a Senator, I mean."
OBI-WAN looks disapprovingly at his apprentice. PADMÉ laughs and
shakes her head.
PADMÉ
"Oh, Annie, you’ll always be that little boy I knew on Tatooine."
"This embarrasses ANAKIN, and he looks down. OBI-WAN and"
CAPTAIN TYPHO smile.
OBI-WAN
"Our presence will be invisible, M’Lady."
TYPHO
"I’m very grateful you here, Master Kenobi. The situation is more"
dangerous than the Senator will admit.
10 CONTINUED 10
PADMÉ
"I don’t need more security, I need answers. I want to know who is"
trying to kill me.
OBI-WAN
(frowning)
"We’re here to protect you, Senator, not to start an investigation."
ANAKIN
"We will find out who’s trying to kill you, Padmé, I promise you!"
He’s done it again. he bites his lip in frustration and shame. OBI-WAN
gives ANAKIN a dirty look.
OBI-WAN
"We are not going to exceed our mandate, my young Padawan"
learner!
ANAKIN
"I meant in the interest of protecting her, Master, of course!"
OBI-WAN
"We are not going through this exercise again, Anakin. You will pay"
attention to my lead.
ANAKIN
Why?
OBI-WAN
What??!!
ANAKIN
"Why else do you think we were assigned to her, if not to find the"
"killer? Protection is a job for local security… not Jedi. It’s overkill,"
Master. Investigation is implied in our mandate.
OBI-WAN
"We will do as the Council has instructed, and you will learn your"
"place, young one."
PADMÉ
Perhaps with merely your presence the mysteries surrounding this
"threat will be revealed. Now, if you will excuse me, I will retire."
Everyone gives AMIDALA a slight bow as she and DORMÉ leave the
room.
TYPHO
"Well, I know I feel a lot better having you here."
(more)
10 CONTINUED: (2) 10
TYPHO
(cont’d)
I’ll have an officer on every floor and I’ll be at the command center
downstairs.
JAR JAR
"Mesa busten wit happiness seein yousa again, Annie. Deesa bad"
"times, bombad times."
CAPTAIN TYPHO leaves.
ANAKIN
"She didn’t even recognize me, Jar Jar. I’ve thought about her every"
day since we parted… and she’s forgotten me completely.
JAR JAR
Shesa happy. Happer den mesa see-en her in longo time.
OBI-WAN
"Anakin, you’re focusing on the negative again. Be mindful of your"
thoughts. She was glad to see us. Now let’s check the security here.
ANAKIN
"Yes, my Master."
11 EXT. JEDI TEMPLE – EVENING 11
"The vast Jedi Temple sits on an endless flat plain, silhouetted against"
the traffic-filled sky.
"12 INT. JEDI TEMPLE, CORRIDOR – EVENING 12"
"MACE WINDU and YODA walk down the long hallway, silhouetted by"
a lit room at the end.
MACE WINDU
Why couldn’t we see this attack on the Senator?
YODA
"Masking the future, is this disturbance in the Force."
MACE WINDU
"The prophecy is coming true, the Dark Side is growing."
YODA
And only those who have turned to the Dark Side can sense the
possibilites of the future. Only going through the Dark Side can we
see.
*GREEN REVISIONS 7/5/00
12 CONTINUED: 12
MACE WINDU
"It’s been then years, and the Sith still have not shown themselves. Do"
you think they are behind this?
YODA
"… Out there, they are. A certainty, that is."
MACE WINDU
Do you think Obi-Wan’s apprentice will be able to bring balance to the
Force?
YODA
Only if he chooses to follow his destiny.
There is a long silence as they walk away. Only footsteps are
heard.
"13 INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA’S APARTMENT, BEDROOM"
– NIGHT 13
"PADMÉ is asleep in her bed, lit only by the light of the city outside her"
window coming through the blinds. ARTOO stands in the corner of
the bedroom. His power is off.
"14 INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA’S APARTMENT, MAIN"
ROOM – NIGHT 14
ANAKIN is standing in the living room. He is in a meditative state. It is
quiet. We hear DISTANT FOOTSTEPS in the corridor outside the
apartment. Suddenly ANAKIN’S eyes pop open. His eyes dart around
"the room. He reaches for his lightsaber, then smiles and puts it back"
on his belt.
"The door to the apartment slides open, and OBI-WAN enters."
OBI-WAN
Captain Typho has more than enough men downstairs. No assassin
will try that way. Any activity up here?
ANAKIN
Quiet as a tomb. I don’t like just waiting here for something to happen
to her.
OBI-WAN checks a palm-sized view scanner he has pulled out of his
"utility belt. It shows a shot of ARTOO by the door, but no sign of"
PADMÉ on the bed.
OBI-WAN
What’s going on?
ANAKIN shrugs.
ANAKIN
She covered the camera. I don’t think she liked me watching her.
*GREEN REVISIONS 7/5/00
14 CONTINUED: 14
OBI-WAN
What is she thinking?
ANAKIN
She programmed Artoo to warn us if there’s an intruder.
OBI-WAN
It’s not an intruder I’m worried about. There are many other ways to
kill a Senator.
ANAKIN
"I know, but we also want to catch this assassin. Don’t we, Master?"
OBI-WAN
You’re using her as bait??
ANAKIN
It was her idea… No harm will come to her. I can sense everything
going on in that room. Trust me.
OBI-WAN
"It’s too risky… and your senses aren’t that attuned, young apprentice."
ANAKIN
And yours are?
OBI-WAN
Possibly.
"15 INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA’S APARTMENT, BEDROOM"
– NIGHT 15
"As PADMÉ sleeps, a PROBE DROID approaches outside her"
"window. It sends out several small arms that attach to the window,"
creating a small hole in the glass. A FAINT SOUND is heard as the
small section of glass is removed from the window.
"ARTOO wakes up, and his lights go on. The PROBE DROID freezes."
"ARTOO looks around, makes a PLAINTIVE LITTLE SOUND, then"
shuts down again. The PROBE DROID attaches a little tube to the
window. TWO DEADLY LOOKING CENTIPEDE-LIKE KOUHUNS
"exit the tube, crawl through the blinds and head toward the sleeping"
PADMÉ.
"16 INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA’S APARTMENT, MAIN"
ROOM – NIGHT 16
ANAKIN and OBI-WAN continue their conversation in the main room
of the apartment.
OBI-WAN
You look tired.
*GREEN REVISIONS 7/5/00
16 CONTINUED: 16
ANAKIN
"I don’t sleep well, anymore."
OBI-WAN
Because of your mother?
ANAKIN
I don’t know why I keep dreaming about her now. I haven’t seen her
since I was little.
OBI-WAN
Dreams pass in time.
ANAKIN
I’d rather dream of Padmé. Just being around her again is…
intoxicating.
OBI-WAN
"Mind your thoughts, Anakin, they betray you. You’ve made a"
commitment to the Jedi Order… a commitment not easily broken…
and don’t forget she’s a politician. They’re not to be trusted.
ANAKIN
"She’s not like the others in the Senate, Master."
OBI-WAN
It’s been my experience that Senators are only focused on pleasing
those who fund their campaigns… and they are more than willing to
forget the niceties of democracy to get those funds.
ANAKIN
"Not another lecture, Master. Not on the economics of politics… and"
"besides, you’re generalizing. The Chancellor doesn’t appear to be"
corrupt.
OBI-WAN
"Palpatine’s a politician, I’ve observed that he is very clever at"
following the passions and prejudices of the Senators.
ANAKIN
I think he is a good man. My instincts are very positive about…
ANAKIN looks stunned. He looks sharply at OBI-WAN.
16 CONTINUED: (2) 16
OBI-WAN
I sense it too.
"17 INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA’S APARTMENT, BEDROOM"
– NIGHT 17
ARTOO sounds an alarm and shines a light on the bed. THE
"KOUHUNS are inches from PADMÉ’S face. Their mouths are open,"
and wicked stinger tongues flick out.
OBI-WAN and ANAKIN burst into the room. The KOUHUNS stand on
their hind legs and hiss as PADMÉ wakes up. ANAKIN throws himself
"in front of her, whacking in half the deadly creatures with his"
lightsaber.
OBI-WAN sees the DROID outside the window and races straight at
"it, crashing through the blinds as he goes through the window,"
"18 EXT. WINDOW LEDGE, APARTMENT BUILDING – NIGHT 18"
OBI-WAN flies through the glass window and flings himself at the
"PROBE DROID, grabbing onto the deadly machine before it can flee."
The PROBE DROID sinks under the weight of OBI-WAN but
"manages to stay afloat and fly away, with the Jedi hanging on for"
"dear life, a hundred stories above the city."
"19 INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA’S APARTMENT – NIGHT 19"
ANAKIN and PADMÉ stare at the sight of OBI-WAN being carried off
by the DROID. ANAKIN turns to her. She pulls her nightdress around
her shoulders.
ANAKIN
Stay here!
"CAPTAIN TYPHO, with TWO GUARDS and DORMÉ, enter the room"
as ANAKIN dashes out.
"20 EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT – NIGHT 20"
The PROBE DROID sends several protective electrical shocks
"across its surface, causing OBI-WAN to almost lose his grip. As they"
"dart in and out of the speeder traffic, OBI-WAN disconnects a wire on"
the back of the DROID. Its power shuts off! OBI-WAN and the DROID
drop like rocks. OBI-WAN realizes the error of his ways and quickly
"puts the wire back. The DROIDI’S systems light up again, and it takes"
off.
21 EXT. SENATE APARTMENTS – ENTRANCE – NIGHT 21
ANAKIN charges out of the building and runs to a line of parked
"speeders. He vaults into a open one and takes off, gunning it fast"
toward the lines of speeder traffic high above.
"22 EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT – NIGHT 22"
"The DROID bumps against a wall, hoping to knock the Jedi loose. It"
moves behind a speeder afterburner to scorch him. It takes the JEDI
wildly between buildings and finally skims across a rooftop
*PINK REVISIONS 6/29/00
22 CONTINUED: 22
"as OBI-WAN is forced to lift his legs, then run across the roof,"
"tenaciously hanging onto the DROID. The DROID heads for a dirty,"
beat-up speeder hidden in an alcove of a building about twenty
"stories up. When the pilot of the speeder, a scruffy Bounty Hunter"
"called ZAM WESELL, sees the DROID approach with OBI-WAN"
"hanging on, she pulls a long rifle out of the speeder and starts to fire"
"at the JEDI, EXPLOSIONS burst all around OBI-VAN."
OBI-WAN
I have a bad feeling about this.
FINALLY the DROID suffers a direct hit and blows up. OBI-WAN falls
"fifty stories, until a speeder drops down next to him, and he manages"
to grab onto the back end of the speeder and haul himself toward the
cockpit. The JEDI struggles to climb into the passenger seat of the
"open speeder and sit down next to the driver, ANAKIN."
ANAKIN
That was wacky! I almost lost you in the traffic.
OBI-WAN
What took you so long?
ANAKIN
"Oh, you know, Master, I couldn’t find a speeder I really liked, with an"
open cockpit… and with the right speed capabilities… and then you
know I had to get a really gonzo color…
They zoom upward in hot pursuit of ZAM as she fires out the open
window at them with her laser pistol.
OBI-WAN
If you’d spend as much time working on your saber skills as you do
"on your wit, young Padawan, you would rival Master Yoda as a"
swordsman.
ANAKIN
I thought I already did.
OBI-WAN
"Only in your mind, my very young apprentice. Careful!! Hey, easy!"
"As this conversation is going on, ANAKIN deftly moves in and out of"
"the oncoming traffic, across lanes, between buildings, and"
miraculously through a construction site. ZAN WESELL continues
firing at them.
ANAKIN
"Sorry, I forgot you don’t like flying, Master."
OBI-WAN
I don’t mind flying… but what you’re doing is suicide.
They barely miss a commuter train.
22 CONTINUED: (2) 22
ANAKIN
"Master, you know I’ve been flying since before I could walk, I’m very"
good at this.
OBI-WAN
Just slow down!
ZAM WESELL and the JEDI race through a line of cross-traffic made
up of giant trucks. The speeders bank sideways as they slide around
right-angle turns between buildings. ZAM races into a tram tunnel.
OBI-WAN
(continuing)
Wait! Don’t go in there!
ANAKIN zooms into the tunnel after ZAM. They see a tram coming at
"them. They brake, turn around, and race out, barely ahead of the"
charging commuter transport.
OBI-WAN
(continuing)
You know I don’t like it when you do that!
ANAKIN
"Sorry, Master. Don’t worry, this guy’s gonna kill himself any minute"
now!
"ZAN WESELL turns into oncoming traffic, deliberately trying to throw"
"the JEDI off. Oncoming speeders swerve, trying to avoid ZAM and"
"the JEDI. ZAM does a quick, tight loop-over and ends up behind the"
JEDI. She is now in a much better position to fire at them with her
"laser pistol. To avoid being hit by the laser bolts, ANAKIN slams on"
the brakes and moves alongside ZAM. She now fires point-blank at
OBI-WAN.
OBI-WAN
What are you doing? He’s gonna blast me.
ANAKIN
Right – this isn’t working.
ANAKIN slides underneath Zam’s speeder. They race along in
"traffic, one speeder right on top of the other. The BOUNTY HUNTER"
"skims over the rooftops, causing ANAKIN to drop behind. ANAKIN"
"goes through his gears, zooming around traffic. They race at high"
"speed across a wide, flat surface of the city planet. A large spacecraft"
almost collides with them as it attempts to land. They round a corner
"and clip a flag, which gets caught on one of the front air scoops."
OBI-WAN
That was too close!
ANAKIN
Clear that!
OBI-WAN
What??
22 CONTINUED: (3) 22
ANAKIN
Clear the flag! We’re losing power! Hurry!
"OBI-WAN leans out of the speeder, then crawls out on the front"
engine and pulls the flag free of the scoop. The speeder lurches
forward with a surge of power.
OBZ-WAN
Whooooaaa! Don’t do that! I don’t like it when you do that!
ANAKIN
"So sorry, Master."
They chase the BOUNTY HUNTER through a power refinery.
OBI-WAN
It’s dangerous near those power couplings! Slow down! Don’t go
through there!
Huge electrical bolts shoot between the buildings as the speeders
pass.
OBI-WAN
(continuing)
"Yiiii, what are you doing?"
ANAKIN
"Sorry, Master!"
OBI-WAN
(sarcastically)
"Oh, that was good…"
ANAKIN
That was crazy!!!
"ZAM slides around a corner sideways, blocking an alley, firing pointblank"
as ANAKIN approaches.
ANAKIN
(continuing)
"Ahh, damn."
OBI-WAN
Stop!!
ANAKIN
"No, we can make it."
ANAKIN barely misses the BOUNTY HUNTER’S speeder as he dives
under it and through a small gap in the building hitting severa1 pipes
and going wildly out of control. ANAKIN struggles to regain
"control of the speeder, narrowly missing a crane, barely clipping"
"a pair of giant struts. A giant gasball shoots up, causing ANAKIN"
"to spin and bump a building, stalling the speeder."
OBI-WAN
I’m crazy… 1I’m crazy… I’m crazy.
22 CONTINUED: (4) 22
ANAKIN
But it worked… we made it.
OBI-WAN
(angrily)
It didn’t work… we’ve stalled! And you almost got us killed!
ANAKIN
I think we’re still alive.
ANAKIN works to get the speeder started. It races to life.
OBI-WAN
(very angrily)
It was stupid!
ANAKIN.
(sheepishly)
I could have made it…
OBI-WAN
(furious)
But you didn’t!!! And now we’ve lost him.
"Suddenly, there is an ambush. Laser bolts are everywhere."
EXPLOSIONS surround them. They look up and see ZAM WESELL
take off.
ANAKIN
No we didn’t…
Out of a cloud of smoke and ball of flames the JEDI tear after ZAM.
They are smoking. OBI-WAN slaps out a small fire on the dashboard.
"ZAM goes up and down, through cross-traffic. There is a near miss"
as a speeder almost hits them. ZAM turns down and left between two
buildings. ANAKIN pulls up and to the right.
OBI-VAN
"Where are you going?! … He went down there, the other way."
ANAKIN
This is a shortcut… I think.
OBI-WAN
"What do you mean, “You think?” What kind of shortcut?! He went"
completely the other way! You’ve lost him!
ANAKIN
"Master, if we keep this chase going, that creep’s gonna end up deep"
"fried. Personally, I’d very much like to find out who in the hell he is"
and who he’s working for…
OBI-WAN
(sarcastic)
"Oh, so that’s why we’re going in the wrong direction."
*PINK REVISIONS 6/29/00
22 CONTINUED: (5) 22
"ANAKIN turns up a side street, zooms up several small"
"passageways, then stops, hovering about fifty stories up."
OBI-WAN
(continuing)
"Well, you lost him."
ANAKIN
"I’m deeply sorry, Master."
ANAKIN looks around front and back. He spots something. He seems
to start counting to himself as he watches something below approach.
ANAKIN
(continuing)
Excuse me for a moment.
ANAKIN jumps out of the speeder. OBI-WAN looks down and sees
Zam’s speeder about five stories below then cruising past. ANAKIN
miraculously lands on top of the Bounty Hunter’s speeder. The
speeder wobbles under the impact. ZAM looks up and realizes what
has happened.
"ZAM takes off, and ANAKIN slides to the back strut and almost slips"
"off, but manages to hang on. ANAKIN works his way back to the"
"speeder’s cockpit, just as ZAM stops suddenly, and ANAKIN flies"
forward to the left front fork. ZAM shoots at him with a laser pistol.
"There is a BLAST near ANAKIN’s hand, which breaks off a piece of"
"the speeder. ANAKIN slides to the right fork of the speeder, where"
"ZAM can’t reach him, then he scrambles to the top, holding onto an"
air scoop.
OBI-WAN has jumped into the driver’s seat of his speeder and is
deftly gaining on the rogue speeder. The two speeders dive through
"oncoming traffic and then through cross traffic. Finally, ANAKIN is"
able to get hold of his lightsaber and starts to cut his way through the
roof of the speeder. ZAM takes out her laser pistol and starts firing at
"the helpless JEDI, knocking the sword out of his hand. OBI-WAN"
races under the speeder and catches the Jedi weapon in the
passenger’s seat.
"ANAKIN sticks his hand into the cockpit and, using the Force, pulls"
"the gun out of ZAM’s hand. She grabs the Jedi’s hand, and they"
"struggle for the weapon. It goes off, blowing a hole in the floor of the"
speeder. The speeder careens wildly out of control. ZAM struggles to
pull the speeder out of its nose dive. OBI-WAN gets slowed down by
traffic and loses sight of the Bounty Hunter’s speeder.
"Just as the speeder is about to nose dive into the ground, ZAM pulls"
"it out, and it slides hard on the pavement in a shower of sparks."
ANAKIN goes flying into the street.
23 EXT. ENTERTAINMENT STREET – NIGHT 23
ZAM exits the crashed speeder and runs. ANAKIN picks himself up of
the pavement and runs after her down the very crowded street.
"It’s the seedy underbelly of the city. Broken sidewalks, garish lights"
reflected in filthy puddles. It’s pretty crowded with various ALIEN
"LOW-LIFES, PANHANDLING DROIDS, and the occasional group of"
UPPERCLASS SLUMMERS.
*PINK REVISIONS 6/29/00
23 CONTINUED: 23
ANAKIN barges into several of them as he chases after the fleeing
"ZAM. He loses the Bounty Hunter in the crowd, then sees him again."
The young Jedi is having a very difficult time getting through the
crowd.
"Ahead, ZAM turns in through a door and disappears."
A nightclub sign is flashing over the door. ANAKIN is just about to
follow ZAM when there is a sudden swirl of litter from downthrusters.
"PEOPLE start moving out of the way, and the open speeder lands in"
"the street beside him. OBI-WAN gets out and walks over, holding out"
ANAKIN’S lightsaber.
OBI-WAN
Anakin!
ANAKIN
"She went into that club, Master."
OBI-WAN
Patience.
OBI-WAN hands ANAKIN the lightsaber.
OBI-WAN
(continuing)
Here. Next time try not to lose it.
ANAKIN
"Sorry, Master."
"ANAKIN reaches for the lightsaber, but OBI-WAN holds it back."
OBI-WAN
A Jedi’s saber is his most precious possession…
ANAKIN
Yes Master.
He reaches for the lightsaber. OBI-WAN pulls it back.
OBI-WAN
He must keep it with him at all times
ANAKIN
"I know, Master."
OBI-WAN
This weapon is your life.
ANAKIN
I’ve heard this lesson before…
OBI-WAN finally holds out the lightsaber and ANAKIN grabs it.
OBI-WAN
"But, you haven’t learned anything, Anakin."
ANAKIN
I try Master.
*PINK REVISIONS 6/29/00
24 INT. NIGHTCLUB – NIGHT 24
"OBI-WAN and ANAKIN enter the nightclub bar, and everyone stares"
at them.
OBI-WAN
Why do I think you are going to be the death of me?!
ANAKIN
Don’t say that Master… You’re the closest thing I have to a father… I
love you. I don’t want to cause you pain.
OBI-WAN
Then why don’t you listen to me?!
ANAKIN
"I will. I’ll do better, I promise."
OBI-WAN
Do you see him?
ANAKIN
I think he’s a she…
OBI-WAN
Then be extra careful…
(nods to the room)
Check it out.
OBT-WAN goes away.
ANAKIN
"Where are you going, Master?"
OBI-WAN
To get a drink.
"OBI-WAN heads for the bar. ANAKIN blinks in surprise, then moves"
"into the room, where ALIEN FACES look back at him with hostility,"
"suspicion, and invitation as he moves among the tables. OBI-WAN"
arrives at the bar. He signals the BARMAN.
CLOSE – Somewhere in the room a HAND moves to a pistol in its
"holster and unsnaps the safety catch. At the bar, a glass is placed in"
front of OBI-WAN. A drink is poured. He lifts the glass.
ELIAN SLEAZEBAGGANO
Wanna buy some death sticks?
OBI-WAN looks at him. He moves his fingers slightly.
OBI-WAN
You don’t want to sell me deathsticks.
ELIAN SLEAZEBAGGANO
I don’t want to sell you deathsticks.
OBI-WAN moves his fingers.
*PINK REVISIONS 6/29/06
24 CONTINUED: 24
OBI-WAN
You want to go home and re-think your life.
ELIAN SLEAZEBAGGANO
I want to go home and re-think my life.
He leaves. OBI-WAN lifts the drink and tosses it back.
CLOSE – The gun is drawn from its holster and held down out of
sight. The BOUNTY HUNTER starts to move toward the bar.
ANAKIN checks out ALIEN FACES. OBI-WAN signals for another
drink. The gun moves toward his unsuspecting back.
The drink is poured. OBI-WAN reaches for it. The gun is raised to aim
"directly at his back, and suddenly OBI-WAN turns fast. His lightsaber"
flashes. There is a shrill SCREAM and ZAM’S ARM hits the floor. The
gun drops from its twitching fingers. Blood spreads.
"The room is silent. ALIEWS rise menacingly from their seats, and"
"ANAKIN is suddenly at OBI-WAN’s side, his lightsaber glowing."
ANAKIN
Easy… official business. Go back to your drinks.
"Slowly, the ALIENS sit. Conversation resumes. Onstage, THE"
PEFORMERS pick up their routine. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN lift ZAM
and carry her out.
25 EXT. ALLEY OUTSIDE NIGHTCLUB – NIGHT 25
OBI-WAN and ANAKIN carry ZAN into the alley and lower her to the
ground. OBI-WAN attends to her wounded shoulder. She stares up
"hatefully at ANAKIN. She winces in pain, then nods."
OBI-WAN
Do you know who it was you were trying to kill?
ZAM WESELL
The Senator from Naboo.
OBI-WAN
Who hired you?
ZAM glares at OBI-WAN.
ZAM WESELL
It was just a job.
ANAKIN
Tell us!
ZAM WSELL
"That Senator’s gonna die soon anyway, and the next one won’t make"
the same mistake I did…
25 CONTINUED: 25
OBI-WAN
This wound’s going to need treatment.
ANAKIN
Who hired you? Tell us… tell us now!
ZAM glares hatefully.
ZAM WESELL
It was a bounty hunter called…
There is a sudden FTZZZ sound. ZAM twitches. She blinks in
surprise and dies.
There is a WHOOSH from above. OBI-1WAN and ANAKIN look up to
see an ARMORED ROCKET-MAN taking off from a roof high above.
He shoots up fast into the sky and disappears. OBI-WAN looks down
"at ZAM. He touches her neck and pulls out a small, wicked-looking"
dart.
OBI-WAN
Toxic dart…
"26 INT. SENATE, BUILDING, AMIDALA’S APARTMENT – DAY 26"
ANAKIN and JAR JAR stand near the door of the anteroom to
PADMÉ’s bedroom. PADMÉ and DORMÉ move about packing
luggage.
PADMÉ
"Representative Binks, I know I can count on you."
JAR JAR
Yousa betchen mesa bottums.
PADMÉ
What??!!
JAR JAR
"(coughs, recovers)"
"Oh, pardone-ay, Senator. I mean, I am honored to accept this heavy"
burden. I take on this responsibility with deep humility tinged with an
overwhelming pride.
(pompously)
It is not every day that I am called upon to…
PADMÉ kisses him on the cheek and gives him a hug. JAR JAR turns
red.
PADMÉ
"You are a good friend, Jar Jar. I don’t wish to hold you up. I’m sure"
you have a great deal to do.
JAR JAR
"Of course, M’Lady."
*BLUE REVISIONS 7/3/00
26 CONTINUED: 26
"JAR JAR bows and goes out. As he passes ANAKIN, he flashes a"
dazzling smile… PADMÉ is in a very bad mood.
PADMÉ
I do not like this idea of hiding.
ANAKIN
"Don’t worry, now that the council has ordered an investigation, it"
won’t take Master Obi-Wan long to find that bounty hunter.
PADMÉ
(frustrated)
I haven’t worked for a year to defeat the “military creation act” not to
be here when its fate is decided!
ANAKIN
Sometimes we have to let go of our pride and do what is requested of
us.
PADMÉ
"Pride?!? Annie, you’re young, and you don’t have a very firm grip on"
politics. I suggest you reserve your opinions for some other time.
ANAKIN
"Sorry, M’Lady. I was only trying to…"
FADMÉ
Annie! No!
ANAKIN
Please don’t call me that.
PADMÉ
What?
ANAKIN
Annie…
PADMÉ
"I’ve always called you that… it is your name, isn’t it?"
ANAKIN
It’s Anakin. When you say Annie it’s like I’m still a little boy… and I’m
not.
PADMÉ
"I’m sorry, Anakin. It’s impossible to deny you’ve…"
(looks him over)
…that you’ve grown up.
PADMÉ smiles at ANAKIN. He becomes a little shy.
26 CONTINUED: (2) 26
ANAKIN
Master Obi-Wan manages not to see it…
PADMÉ
Mentors have a way of seeing more of our faults than we would like.
It’s the only way we grow.
ANAKIN
"Don’t get me wrong… Obi-Wan is a great mentor, as wise as Master"
Yoda and as powerful as Master Windu. I am truly thankful to be his
"apprentice. Only… although I’m a Padawan learner, in some ways…"
a lot of ways… I’m ahead of him. I’m ready for the trials. I know I am!
He knows it too. He feels I’m too unpredictable… other Jedi my age
have gone through the trials and made it… I know I started my
training late… but he won’t let me move on.
PADMÉ
That must be frustrating.
ANAKIN
It’s worse… he’s overly critical! He never listens! He just doesn’t
understand. It’s not fair!
PADMÉ cannot suppress a laugh. She shakes her head.
PADMÉ
"I’m sorry… You sounded exactly like that little boy I once knew, when"
be didn’t get his way.
ANAKIN
I’m not whining! I’m not.
PADMÉ just smiles at him. DORMÉ laughs in the background.
PADMÉ
I didn’t say it to hurt you.
ANAKIN
I know…
"There is a brief silence, then PADMÉ comes over to ANAKIN."
PADMÉ
Anakin…
They look into each other’s eyes for the first time.
PADMÉ
(continuing)
Don’t try to grow up too fast.
26 CONTINUED: (3) 26
ANAKIN
I am grown up. You said it yourself.
ANAKIN looks deep into PADME’s eyes.
PADMÉ
Please don’t look at me like that.
ANAKIN
Why not?
PADMÉ
Because I can see what you’re thinking.
ANAKIN
(laughing)
"Ahh… So, you have Jedi powers too?"
DORMÉ is watching with concern.
PADMÉ
It makes me feel uncomfortable.
ANAKIN
"Sorry, M’Lady."
ANAKIN backs away as PADMÉ turns and goes back to her packing.
"27 EXT. CORUSCANT, SPACEPORT FREIGHTER DOCKS,"
TRANSPORT BUS – DAY 27
A small bus speeds toward the massive freighter docks of
Coruscant’s industrial area. The spaceport is bustling with activity.
Transports of various sizes move supplies and passengers as giant
floating cranes lift cargo out of the starships. The bus stops before a
"huge, intergalactic freighter starship. It parks in the shadows of an"
overhang.
"27 EXT. CORUSCANT, SPACEPORT FREIGHTER DOCKS,"
TRANSPORT BUS – DAY 28
"ANAKIN and PADMÉ, dressed in Outland peasant outfits, get up and"
"head for the door where CAPTAIN TYPHO, DORMÉ, and OBI-WAN"
are waiting to hand them their luggage. DORMÉ is dressed to look
like Senator Amidala.
CAPTAIN TYPHO
"Be safe, M’Lady."
PADMÉ
"Thank you, Captain. Take good care of Dormé… The threat’s on you"
two now.
DORMÉ
He’ll be safe with me.
"They laugh, and PADMÉ embraces her faithful handmaiden. DORMÉ"
starts to weep.
28 CONTINUED: 28
PADMÉ
You’ll be fine.
DORMÉ
"It’s not me, M’Lady. I worry about you. What if they realize I’m not"
you?
PADMÉ
(looks to Anakin)
Then my Jedi protector will have to prove bow grown up he is.
DORMÉ and PADMÉ smile. ANAKIN frowns as OBI-WAN pulls him
aside.
OBI-WAN
"Anakin, you stay put on Naboo. Don’t attract attention. Do absolutely"
nothing without checking in with me or the Council.
ANAKIN
"Yes, Master."
OBI-WAN
(to Padmé)
"I will get to the bottom of this plot quickly, M’Lady. You’ll be back here"
in no time.
PADMÉ
"I will be most grateful for your speed, Master Jedi."
ANAKIN
Time to go.
PADMÉ
I know.
"PADMÉ gives DORMÉ a last hug, ANAKIN picks up the luggage, and"
"the TWO PEASANTS exit the speeder bus, where ART00 is waiting"
for them.
OBI-WAN
May The Force Be With You.
ANAKIN
"May The Force Be With You, Master."
They head off toward the giant Starfreighter.
PADMÉ
"Suddenly, I’m afraid…"
ANAKIN
"This is my first assignment on my own, I’m kinda scared too."
PADMÉ
There’s nothing to worry about we have Artoo with us.
They 1augh.
28 CONTINUED: (2) 28
OBI-WAN and CAPTAIN TYPHO watch ANAKIN and PADMÉ
disappear into the vastness of the spaceport with ARTOO trundling
along behind them.
OBI-WAN
I hope he doesn’t try anything foolish.
CAPTAIN TYPHO
"I’d be more concerned about her doing something, than him."
29 EXT. FREIGHTER DOCKS – CORUSCANT – DAY 29
The freighter slowly takes off from the huge docks area of Coruscant.
It soon moves into the crowded skies.
"30 EXT. JEDI TEMPLE, MAIN HALLWAY – LATE DAY 30"
"From high above, light streams down from the lofty ceilings. OBIWAN"
"crosses the floor of the great hallway, heading for the Analysis"
Rooms.
"31 INT. JEDI TEMPLE, ANALYSIS CUBICLES – LATE DAY 31"
OBI-WAN walks past several glass cubicles where work is going on.
He comes to an empty one and sits down in front of a console. A PK-
4 ANALYSIS DROID comes to life. A tray slides out of the console.
PK-4
"Place the subject for analysis on the sensor tray, please."
"091-WAS puts the dart onto the tray, which retracts into the console."
"The DROID activates the system, and a screen lights up in front of"
OBI-WAN.
OBI-WAN
"It’s a toxic dart, I need to know where it came from and who made it"
PK-4
"One moment, please."
"Diagrams and data appear on the screen, scrolling past at great"
speed. OBI-WAN watches as the screen goes blank. The tray slides
out.
PK-4
(continuing)
"As you can see on your screen, subject weapon does not exist in any"
known culture. Markings cannot be identified. Probably self-made by
a warrior not associated with any known society.
OBI-WAN
Excuse me? Could you try again please?
31 CONTINUED: 31
PK-4
"Master Jedi, our records are very thorough. They cover eighty"
"percent of the galaxy. If I can’t tell you where it came from, nobody"
can.
"OBI-WAN picks up the dart and looks at it, then looks to the DROID."
OBI-WAN
"Thanks for your assistance! You may not be able to figure this out,"
but I think I know someone who might.
"32 EXT. SPACE, STARSHIP FREIGHTER 32"
"The massive, slow-moving Freighter suddenly zooms away into"
lightspeed.
"33 INT. STARFREIGHTER, STEERAGE HOLD – DAY 33"
"A great, gloomy hold is crowded with EMIGRANTS and their"
"belongings. To one side ARTOO is coming to the head of a food line,"
where SERVERS are ladling out bowls of mush. ARTOO holds two
bowls.
SERVER
Keep moving! Keep moving!
ARTOO slips a tube into a tub of mush and sucks up a large quantity.
"With one of his little claw-arms, he grabs several chunks of"
something that looks like bread. A SERVER sees him.
SERVER
(continuing)
Hey! No Droids!
ARTOO takes one last big suck and heads away from the food line.
The SERVER shouts after him angrily. The little droid moves past
groups of eating or sleeping EMIGRANTS and comes to where
ANAKIN is sound asleep. The young Jedi seems to be having a
"nightmare. He is very restless,"
ANAKIN
"No, no, Mom, no…"
He is sweating. PADMÉ leans over to wipe some of the sweat from
"his forehead. He wakes with a start, then realizes where he is."
"PADMÉ simply looks at him. He stares back, somewhat confused."
ARTOO fills up two bowls with mush.
ANAKIN
(continuing)
What?
PADMÉ
You seemed to be having a nightmare.
"ANAKIN looks at PADMÉ a little more closely, trying to see if he"
revealed any of his secrets. She hands him a bowl of mush and
bread.
33 CONTINUED: 33
PADMÉ
(continuing)
Are you hungry?
ANAKIN
Thanks.
PADMÉ
We went into lightspeed a while ago.
ANAKIN looks into PADMÉ’s eyes.
ANAKIN
I look forward to seeing Naboo again. I’ve thought about it every day
since I left. It’s by far the most beautiful place I’ve ever seen…
PADMÉ is a little unnerved by his intense stare.
PADMÉ
You were just a little boy then. It may not be as you remember it; time
changes your perception.
ANAKIN
I think time has given me much more mature feelings to enhance my
perception.
PADMÉ
It must be difficult having sworn your life to the Jedi… not being able
to visit the places you like… or do the things you like…
ANAKIN
Or be with the people I love.
PADMÉ
Are you allowed to love? I thought it was forbidden for a Jedi.
ANAKIN
"Attachment is forbidden. Possession is forbidden. Compassion, which"
"I would define as unconditional love, is central to a Jedi’s life, so you"
might say we’re encouraged to love.
PADMÉ
You have changed so much.
33 CONTINUED: (2) 33
ANAKIN
You haven’t changed a bit. You’re exactly the way I remember you in
my dreams. I doubt if Naboo has changed much either.
PADMÉ
It hasn’t…
ANAKIN
I can’t wait to breathe that sweet breeze that comes off the rolling
"hills. Whenever I try to visualize the Force, those hills are what I see."
ANAKIN looks at PADMÉ when he says this.
ANAKIN
(continuing)
I love Naboo…
There is an awkward moment.
PADMÉ
(changing the subject)
"You were dreaming about your mother earlier, weren’t you?"
ANAKIN
"Yes… I left Tatooine so long ago, my memory of her is fading. I don’t"
want to lose it. Recently I’ve been seeing her in my dreams… vivid
dreams… scary dreams. I worry about her.
PADMÉ gives ANAKIN a sympathetic look.
"34 EXT. CORDSCANT, DOWNTOWN, BACK STREET – MORNING"

OBI-WAN walks down the street. It is a pretty tough part of town. Old
"buildings, warehouses, beat up speeders and transporter rigs"
"thundering past. Above, the old elevated monospeed with occasional"
“shiny freighters” hissing through.
OBI-WAN comes to a kind of alien diner. On the steamed-up
"windows it says “DEX’S DINER,” in alien lettering. He goes inside."
"35 INT. CORUSCANT, DEX’S DINER – MORNING 35"
"A young waitress, HERMIONE BAGWA, is wiping off a booth"
tabletop. There is a counter with stools and a line of booths along the
wall by the window. A number of CUSTOMERS are eating – TOUGHLOOKING
"WORKES, FREIGHTER DRIVERS ETC. HERNIONE"
looks up as OBI-WAN comes in.
HERMIONE BAGWA
Can I help ya?
OBI-WAN
I’m looking for Dexter.
35 CONTINUED: 35
HERMIONE’s eyes narrow.
HERMIONE BAGWA
Waddya want him for?
OBI-WAN
He’s not in trouble. It’s personal.
"HERMIONE stares at OBI-WAN. There is a brief pause, then she"
goes to the open serving hatch behind the counter.
HERMIONE BAGWA
"Someone to see ya, honey."
(lowering her voice)
"A Jedi, by the looks of him."
Steam billows out from the kitchen hatch behind the counter as a
huge head pokes through.
DEXTER JETTSTER
Obi-Wan!
OBI-WAN
"Hey, Dex."
DEXTER JETTSTER
Take a seat! Be right with ya!
OBI-WAN sits in a booth.
HERMIONE BAGWA
You want a cup of ardees?
OBI-WAN
Thank you.
HERMIONE moves off as the door to the counter opens and
"DEXTER JETTSTER a1ppears. He is big – bald and sweaty, old and"
"alien. Not someone to tangle with. He arrives, beaming hugely."
DEXTER JETTSTER
"Hey, ol’ buddy!"
OBI-WAN
"Hey, Dex."
DEXTER eases himself into the seat opposite OBI-WAN. He can just
make it. HERMIONE sets two mugs of steaming ardees in front of
them.
DEXTER JETTSTER
"So, my friend, what can I do for ya?"
OBI-WAN
You can tell me what this is.
OBI-WAN places the dart on the table between them. DEX’s eyes
widen. He puts down his mug.
DEXTER JETTSTER
(softly)
"Well, waddya know…"
35 CONTINUED: (2) 35
DEXTER picks up the dart delicately between his puffy fingers and
peers at it.
DEXTER JETTSTER
(continuing)
I ain’t seen one of these since I was prospecting on Subterrel beyond
the outer rim!
OBI-WAN
Do you know where it came from?
DEXTER grins. He puts the dart down between them.
DEXTER JETTSTER
"This baby belongs to them cloners. What you got here, is a Kamino"
Kyberdart.
OBI-WAN
Kamino Kyberdart?.. I wonder why it didn’t show up in our analysis
archive.
DEXTER JETTSTER
It’s these funny little cuts on the side that give it away… Those
"analysis droids you’ve got over there only focus on symbols, you"
know. I should think you Jedi would have more respect for the
difference between know1edge and wisdom.
OBI-WAN
"Well, Dex, if droids could think, we wouldn’t be here, would we?"
(laughing)
Kamino… doesn’t sound familiar. Is it part of the Republic?
DEXTER JETTSTER
"No, it’s beyond the outer rim. I’d say about twelve parsecs outside the"
"Rishi Maze, toward the south. It should be easy to find, even for"
those droids in your archive to find. These Kaminoians keep to
"themselves. They’re cloners. Damned good ones, too."
"OBI-WAN picks up the dart, holding it midway between them."
OBI-WAN
Cloners? Are they friendly?
DEXTER JETTSTER
It depends.
OBI-WAN
"On what, Dex?"
DEXTER grins.
35 CONTINUED: (3) 35
DEXTER JETTSTER
On how good your manners are… and how big your pocketbook is…
36 EXT. NABOO SPACEPORT – DAY 36
The Starfreighter lands in the giant port city of Theed.
"PADMÉ, ANAKIN, and ARTOO are among the EMIGRANTS"
streaming from the Starfreighter into the vast docking area. They exit
onto the main plaza.
"37 EXT. NABOO PALACE, GRAND COURTYARD -AFTERNOON 37"
"The speeder bus pulls up and stops. PADMÉ, ANAKIN, and ARTOO"
"get out. The great courtyard stretches before them, and they see the"
rose-colored domes of the palace on the far side. ARTOO
WHISTLES. They pick up their gear and start to cross the courtyard.
ARTOO trundles behind them.
ANAKIN
"If I grew up here, I don’t think I’d ever leave."
PADMÉ
(laughing)
I doubt that.
ANAKIN
"No, really. When I started my training, I was very homesick and very"
lonely. This city and my Mom were the only pleasant things I had to
"think about… the problem was, the more I thought about my Mom,"
the worse it felt. But I would feel better if I thought about the palace –
the way it shimmers in the sunlight – the way the air always smells of
flowers…
PADMÉ
…and the soft sound of the distant waterfalls. The first time I saw I
"the Capital, I was very young… I’d never seen a waterfall before. I"
thought they were so beautiful… I never dreamed one day I’d live in
the palace.
ANAKIN
"Well, tell me, did you dream of power and politics when you were a"
little girl?
PADMÉ
(laughing)
No. That was the last thing I thought of.
(more)
37 CONTINUED: 37
PADMÉ(cont’d)
My dream was to help in the “Refugee Relief Movement.” I never
"thought of running for elected office. But the more history I studied,"
the more I realized how much good politicians could do. So when I
"was eight, I joined the “Apprentice Legislators,” then later on became"
"a Senatorial advisor, with such a passion that, before I knew it, I was"
elected Queen. Partly because I scored so high on my education
"certificate, but for the most part it was my conviction that reform was"
"possible. I wasn’t the youngest Queen ever elected, but now that I"
"think back on it, I’m not sure I was old enough. I’m not sure I was"
ready.
ANAKIN
The people you served thought you did a good job. I heard they tried
to amend the Constitution so you could stay in office.
PADMÉ
"Popular rule is not democracy, Annie. It gives the people what they"
"want, not what they need. And, truthfully, I was relieved when my two"
terms were up. So were my parents. They worried about me during
"the blockade and couldn’t wait for it all to be over. Actually, I was"
"hoping to have a family by now… My sisters have the most amazing,"
"wonderful kids… but when the Queen asked me to serve as Senator,"
I couldn’t refuse her.
ANAKIN
I agree! I think the Republic needs you… I’m glad you chose to serve.
I feel things are going to happen in our generation that will change
the galaxy in profound ways.
PADMÉ
I think so too.
ANAKIN and PADMÉ walk toward the palace. ARTOO continues to
follow.
"38 INT. NABOO PALACE, THRONE ROOM – AFTERNOON 38"
"QUEEN JAMILLIA is seated on the throne, flanked by SIO BIBBLE"
and a COUPLE 0F ADVISORS. FOUR HANDMAIDENS stand close
"by, and GUARDS are at the doors."
38 CONTINUED: 38
QUEEN JAMILLIA
We’ve been worried about you.
(takes her hand)
"I’m so glad you’re safe, Padmé."
PADMÉ
"Thank you, Your Highness. I only wish I could have served you better"
by staying on Coruscant for the vote.
SIO BIBBLE
"Given the circumstances, Senator, you know it was the only decision"
Her Highness could have made.
QUEEN JAMILLIA
How many systems have joined Count Dooku and the separatists?
PADMÉ
About two hundred. And more are leaving the Republic every day. If
"the Senate votes to create an army, I’m sure it’s going to push us into"
a civil war.
SIO BIBBLE
It’s unthinkable. There hasn’t been a full-scale war since the
formation of the Republic.
QUEEN JAMILLIA
"Do you see any way, through negotiations, to bring the separatists"
back into the Republic?
PADMÉ
"Not if they feel threatened. The separatists don’t have an army, but if"
"they are provoked, they will move to defend themselves, I’m sure of"
"that. And with no time or money to build an army, my guess is they"
will turn to the Commerce Guilds or the Trade Federations for help.
QUEEN JAMILLIA
The armies of commerce! Why has nothing been done in the Senate
to restrain them?
PADMÉ
"I’m afraid that, despite the Chancellor’s best efforts, there are still"
"many bureaucrats, judges, and even Senators on the payrolls of the"
Guilds.
38 CONTINUED: (2) 38
SIO BIBBLE
"It’s outrageous that, after all of those hearings, and four trials in the"
"Supreme Court, Nute Gunray is still the Viceroy of the Trade"
Federation. Do those money mongers control everything?
QUEEN JAMILLIA
"Remember, Counselor, the courts were able to reduce the"
Federation’s armies. That’s a move in the right direction.
PADMÉ
"There are rumors, Your Highness, that the Federation Army was not"
reduced as they were ordered.
ANAKIN
The Jedi have not been allowed to investigate. It would be too
"dangerous for the economy, we were told."
QUEEN JAMILLIA
We must keep our faith in the Republic. The day we stop believing
democracy can work is the day we lose it.
PADMÉ
Let’s pray that day never comes.
QUEEN JAMILLIA
In the meantime.. we must consider your own safety.
SIO BIBBLE signals. All the OTHER ADVISORS and ATTENDANTS
bow and leave the room.
SIO BIBBLE
(to Anakin)
"What is your suggestion, Master Jedi?"
PADMÉ
"Anakin’s not a Jedi yet, Counselor. He’s still a Padawan learner. I"
was thinking…
ANAKIN
(nettled)
"Hey, hold on a minute."
PADMÉ
Excuse me! I was thinking I would stay in the Lake Country. There
are some places up there that are very isolated.
ANAKIN
"Excuse me! I am in charge of security here, M’Lady."
38 CONTINUED: (3) 38
SIO BIBBLE and QUEEN JAMILLIA exchange a look. Something is
going on here.
PADMÉ
"Annie, my life is at risk, and this is my home. I know it very well… that"
is why we’re here. I think it would be wise for you to take advantage
of my knowledge in this instance.
ANAKIN
(takes a deep breath)
"Sorry, M’Lady."
SIO BIBBLE
"(to Anakin, amused)"
She is right. The lake country is the most remote part of Naboo. Not
many people and a clear view of the surrounding terrain.
QUEEN JAMILLIA
Perfect. It’s settled then.
"ANAKIN glares at PADMÉ. Then QUEEN JAMILLIA gets up, and"
they all start to leave.
QUEEN JAMILLIA
(continuing)
"Padmé, I had an audience with your father yesterday. I told him what"
was happening. He hopes you will visit your mother before you
leave… your family’s very worried about you.
PADMÉ looks worried. They ALL exit down the main staircase.
39 EXT. JEDI TEMPLE – DAY 39
The main entrance at the base of the huge temple is bustling with
activity. All sorts of JEDI are coming and going.
"40 INT. JEDI TEMPLE, ARCHIVE LIBRARY – DAY 40"
"A bronze bust of Count Dooku, stands among a line of other busts of"
"Jedi in the Archive Room. OBI-WAN stands in front of it, studying the"
striking features of the chiseled face.
"On the walls, lighted computer panels seem to stretch to infinity."
"Farther along the room in the background, FIVE JEDI are seated at"
"tables, studying archive material."
"After OBI-WAN studies the bust for a few moments, MADAME"
"JOCASTA NU, the Jedi Archivist, is standing next to him. She is an"
"elderly, frail-looking human Jedi. Tough as old boots and smart as a"
whip.
JOCASTA NU
Did you call for assistance?
40 CONTINUED: 40
OBI-WAN
(distracted in thought)
"Yes… yes, I did…"
JOCASTA NU
"He has a powerful face, doesn’t he? He was one of the most brilliant"
Jedi I have had the privilege of knowing.
OBI-WAN
I never understood why he quit. Only twenty Jedi have ever left the
Order.
JOCASTA NU
(sighs)
The Lost Twenty… And Count Dooku was the most recent and the
most painful. No one likes to talk about it. His leaving was a great
loss to the Order.
OBI-MAN
What happened?
JOCASTA NU
"Well, one might say, he was always a bit out of step with the"
"decisions of the Council… much like your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn."
OBI-WAN
(surprised)
Really?
JOCASTA NU
"Oh, yes. They were alike in many ways. Very individual thinkers…"
idealists…
JOCASTA NU gazes at the bust.
JOCASTA NU
(continuing)
He was always striving to become a more powerful Jedi. He wanted
"to be the best. With a lightsaber, in the old style of fencing, he had no"
"match. His knowledge of the Force was… unique. In the end, I think"
he left because he lost faith in the Republic. He believed that politics
"were corrupt, and he felt the Jedi betrayed themselves by serving the"
politicians. He always had very high expectations of government. He
"disappeared for nine or ten years, then just showed up recently as"
the head of the separatist movement.
40 CONTINUED: (2) 40
OBI-WAN
Interesting… I’m still not sure I understand.
JOCASTA NU
"Well, I’m sure you didn’t call me over here for a history lesson. Are"
"you having a problem, Master Kenobi?"
OBI-WAN
"Yes, I’m trying to find a planet system called Kamino. It doesn’t seem"
to show up on any of the archive charts.
JOCASTA NU
Kamino? It’s not a system I’m familiar with… let me see…
"JOCASTA NU leans over OBI-WAN’s shoulder, looking at the screen."
JOCASTA NU
(continuing)
Are you sure you have the right coordinates?
OBI-WAN
(nodding)
"According to my information, it should be in this quadrant"
somewhere… just south of the Rishi Maze.
JOCASTA NU taps the keyboard and frowns.
JOCASTA NU
No coordinates? It sounds like the sort of directions you’d get from a
street tout… some old miner or Furbog trader.
OBI-WAN
"All three, actually."
JOCASTA NU
Are you sure it exists?
OBI-QAN
Absolutely.
JOCASTA NU
Let me do a gravitational scan.
OBI-WAN and JOCASTA NU study the star map hologram.
JOCASTA NU
(continuing)
There are some inconsistencies here. Maybe the planet you’re
seeking was destroyed.
OBI-WAN
Wouldn’t that be on record?
40 CONTINUED: (3) 40
JOCASTA NU
"It ought to be, unless it was very recent."
(shakes her head)
"I hate to say it, but it looks like the system you’re searching for"
doesn’t exist.
OBI-WAN
That’s impossible… perhaps the archives are incomplete.
JOCASTA NU
"The archives are comprehensive and totally secure, my young Jedi."
One thing you may be absolutely sure of – if an item does not appear
"in our records, it does not exist!"
"OBI-WAN stares at her, then looks back to the map."
"41 EXT. THEED, RESIDENTIAL AREA, SIDE STREET –"
AFTERNOON 41
PEOPLE are passing through the little street. OLD MEN are sunning
"themselves. WOMEN are gossipping, KIDS are playing. ANAKIN,"
"PADMÉ, and ART00 turn onto a side street. ANAKIN is back in his"
"Jedi robes. PADMÉ wears a beautiful simple dress. She stops,"
beaming.
PADMÉ
There’s my house!
PADMÉ starts forward; ANAKIN hangs back.
PADMÉ
(continuing)
What? Don’t say you’re shy!
ANAKIN
(untruthfully)
"No, but I…"
"Suddenly there are shouts from two little girls, RYOO (age 6) and"
POOJA (age 4). They come running toward PADMÉ.
RYOO & POOJA
Aunt Padmé!! Aunt Padmé!!
PADMÉ
Ryoo!! Pooja!!
PADMÉ scoops up RYOO and POOJA and hugs them.
PADMÉ
(continuing)
"I’m so happy to see you! This is Anakin. Anakin, this is Ryoo, and this"
is Pooja.
ANAKIN and the GIRLS say hello shyly. Then:
41 CONTINUED: 41
RYOO & POOJA
Artoo!!!
"As they see the droid, they hug him. ARTOO WHISTLES and"
BEEPS. PADMÉ laughs. ANAKIN and PADMÉ go on toward the
house. The GIRLS stay and play with ARTOO.
"42 INT. PADMÉ’S PAENTS’ HOUSE, MAIN ROOM –"
AFTERNOON 42
"SOLA, PADMÉ’S beautiful older sister, comes in from the kitchen"
carrying a big bowl of food.
SOLA
(over her shoulder)
"They’re eating over at iev Narran’s later, Mom. The just had a snack."
They’ll be Fine.
"SOLA puts the bowl down on the table, where ANAKIN, PADMÉ, and"
RUWEE NABERRIE (Padmé’s father) are coming-intar the room.
PADMÉ
"Anakin, this is my sister, So1a."
SOLA
"Hello, Anakin."
ANAKIN
Hello.
"SOLA sits, as JOBAL NABERRIE (Padmé’s mother) comes in with a"
heaped bowl of steaming good.
JOBAL
"You’re just in time for dinner. I hope you’re hungry, Anakin."
ANAKIN
A little.
PADMÉ
"He’s being polite, Mom. We’re starving."
RUWEE
(grinning)
"You came to the right place at the right time. Sit down, son."
EVERYONE sits and starts passing food.
JOBAL
(to Padmé)
"Honey, it’s so good to see you safe. We were so worried."
PADMÉ gives JOBAL a dirty look. RUWEE smiles as he watches.
RUWEE
Dear…
42 CONTINUED: 42
JOBAL
"I know, I know but I bad to say it. Now it’s done."
SOLA
"Well, this is exciting! Do you know, Anakin, you’re the first boyfriend"
my sister’s ever brought home?
PADMÉ
(rolls her eyes)
Sola!! He isn’t my boyfriend! He’s a Jedi assigned by the Senate to
protect me.
JOBAL
"A bodyguard?! 0h, Padmé! The didn’t tell us it was that serious!"
PADMÉ
"It’s not, Mom, I promise."
(glances at Jobal)
"Anyway, Anakin’s a friend. I’ve known him for years. Remember that"
little boy who was with the Jedi during the blockade crisis?
They nod.
PADMÉ
(continuing)
He grew up.
JOBAL
"Honey, when are you going to settle down? Haven’t you had enough"
of that life? I certainly have.
PADMÉ
"Mom, I’m not in any danger."
RUWEE
(to Anakin)
Is she?
ANAKIN
…Yes… I’m afraid she is.
PADMÉ
(quickly)
But not much.
43 EXT. PADMÉ’S PARENTS’ GADEN – AFTERNOON 43
ANAKIN and RUWEE are walking.
RUWEE
"Sometimes I wish I’d traveled more… but I must say, I’m happy here."
43 CONTINUED: 43
ANAKIN
Padmé tells me you teach at the university?
RUWEE
(nodding)
"Yes, and before that, I was a builder. I also worked for the Refugee"
"Relief Movement, when I was very young."
"44 INT. PADMÉ’S PARENTS’ HOUSE, MAIN ROOM –"
AFTERNOON 44
"PADMÉ, SOLA and JOBAL are clearing the table."
SOLA
Why haven’t you told us about him?
PADMÉ
What’s there to talk about? He’s just a boy.
SOLA
A boy? Have you seen the way he looks at you?
PADMÉ
Sola – stop it!
SOLA
"It’s obvious he has feelings for you. Are you saying, little baby sister,"
that you haven’t noticed?
PADMÉ
"I’m not your baby sister, Sola, Anakin and I are friends… our"
relationship is strictly professional.
(to Jobal)
"Mom, would you tell her to stop it?"
SOLA
(laughing)
"Well, maybe you haven’t noticed the way he looks at you. I think"
you’re afraid to.
PADMÉ
Cut it out.
JOBAL
Sola’s just concerned… we all are.
PADMÉ
"Oh, Mom, you’re impossible. What I’m doing is important."
JOBAL
"You’ve done your service, Padmé. It’s time you had a life of your"
own. You’re missing so much.
45 EXT. PADME’S PARENTS’ GARDEN – AFTERNOON 45
ANAKIN and RUWEE are walking in the garden. RUWEE stops and
faces ANAKIN directly.
RUWEE
"Now tell me, son. How serious in this thing? How much danger is my"
daughter really in?
ANAKIN
There have been two attempts on her life. Chances are there’ll be
more. My Master is tracking down the assassins. I’m sure he’ll find
out who they are. This situation won’t last long.
RUWEE
I don’t want anything to happen to her.
ANAKIN
I don’t either.
"46 INT. PADMÉ’S PARENTS’ HOUSE, PADMÉS ROOM –"
AFTERNOON 46
PADMÉ throws some things into a bag.
PADMÉ
"Don’t worry, this won’t take long."
ANAKIN
I just want to get there before dark.
PADMÉ goes on packing. ANAKIN looks around the rocm.
ANAKIN
(continuing)
You still live at home.
PADMÉ
"I move around so much, I’ve never had a place of my own. Official"
residences have no warmth. I feel good here. I feel at home.
ANAKIN
I never had a real home. Home was always where my Mon was.
ANAKIN picks up a framed hologram.
ANAKIN
(continuing)
Is this you?
The hologram shows PADMÉ at age seven or eight surrounded by
forty or fifty little green creatures. She is holding one in her arms.
They are all smiling hugely.
46 CONTINUED: 46
PADMÉ
That was when I went with the Relief Group to Shadda-Bi-Boran.
"Their sun was imploding, and the planet was dying. I was helping to"
relocate the children. See that little one I’m holding? His name was
"N’a-kee-tula, which means sweetheart. He was so full of life. All those"
"kids were. I did everything I could to save him, but he died… they all"
did. They were never able to adapt… to live off their native planet.
ANAKIN picks up another hologram. It shows PADMÉ at age ten or
eleven. She is wearing official robes and standing between two robed
legislators. Her expression is severe.
PADMÉ
(continuing)
My first day as an Apprentice Legislator. Notice the difference?
PADMÉ pulls a face. ANAKIN grins. She continues packing. ANAKIN
"sets the two holograms down side by side – the beaming little girl,"
"and the stern, unsmiling adolescent."
"47 INT. JEDI TEMPLE, MAIN HALLWAY – DAY 47"
OBI-WAN walks through the main hallway to the training area.
"48 INT. JEDI TEMPLE, TRAINING VERANDA – DAY 48"
"OBI-WAN comes out onto the veranda and stops, watching TWENTY"
"or so FOUR-YEAR-0LDS doing training exercises, supervised by"
YODA. They wear helmets over their eyes and try to strike little
TRAINING DROIDS with their miniature lightsabers. The DROIDS
dance in front of them.
YODA
"Don’t think… feel… be as one with the Force. Help you, it will."
(he sees Obi-Wan)
Younglings – enough! A visitor we have. Welcome him.
The CHILDREN take off their helmets and turn off their lightsabers.
YODA
(continuing)
"Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, meet the mighty Bear Clan."
CHILDREN
"Welcome, Master Obi-Wan!"
OBI-WAN
"I am sorry to disturb you, Master."
"YODA,"
"What help to you, can I be?"
48 CONTINUED: 48
OBI-WAN
I’m looking for a planet described to me by an old friend. I trust him.
But the system doesn’t show up on the archive maps.
YODA
"An interesting puzzle. Gather round the map reader, Younglings."
"Master Obi-Wan has lost a planet. Find it, we will try…"
The reader is a small shaft with a hollow at the top. The CHILDREN
gather around it. OBI-WAN takes out a little glass ball and places it
"into the bowl. The window shades-close, the reader lights up and"
projects the star map hologram into the room. The CHILDREN laugh.
Some of them reach up to try and touch the nebulae and stars. OBIWAN
walks into the display.
OBI-WAN
This is where it ought to be… but it isn’t. Gravity is pulling all the stars
in this area inward to this spot. There should be a star here… but
there isn’t.
YODA
"Most interesting. Gravity’s silhouette remains, but the star and all of"
its planets have disappeared. How can this be?
There is a brief pause. Then a CHILD puts its hand up. YODA nods.
JEDI CHILD JACK
Because someone erased it from the archive memory.
CHILDREN
That’s right! Yes! That’s what happened! Someone erased it!
JEDI CHILD MAY
"If the planet blew up, the gravity would go away."
OBI-WAN stares; YODA chuckles.
YODA
"Truly wonderful, the mind of a child is. Uncluttered. To the center of"
"the pull of gravity go, and find your planet you will."
OBI-WAN
"But Master Yoda, who could have erased information from the"
"archives? That’s impossible, isn’t it?"
YODA
(frowning)
"Much harder to answer, that question is."
"49 EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, WATER SPEEDER, LANDING"
PLATFORM – LATE AFTERNOON
"A water speeder driven by PADDU ACCU, the retreat caretaker,"
skims across the lake away from the landing platform where a
chrome Naboo Starship rests. ANAKIN and PADMÉ are sitting in the
speeder as it skims away to where a lodge rises on a beautiful
island in tbe middle of the lake.
"50 EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, GARDEN TERRACE –"
LATEAFTERNOON
ANAKIN and PADMÉ walk up the stairs from where the water
speeder is parked onto a terrace overlooking a lovely garden. Behind
"them, PADDY ACCU supervises two serving girls, NANDI and"
"TECKLA, as they carry the bags inside."
ANAKIN and PADMÉ stop at the balustrade. PADMÉ looks out
across the garden to the shimmering lake and the mountains rising
beyond. ANAKIN looks at her.
PADMÉ
"When I was in Level Three, we used to come here for school retreat."
See that island? We used to swim there every day. I love the water.
ANAKIN
I do too. I guess it comes from growing up on a desert planet.
PADMÉ becomes aware that ANAKIN is looking at her.
PADMÉ
…We used to lie on the sand and let the sun dry as and try to guess
the names of the birds singing.
ANAKIN
"I don’t like sand. It’s coarse and rough and irritating, and it gets"
everywhere. Not like here. Here everything’s soft… and smooth…
He touches her arm. PADMÉ has become receptive to the way he
looks at her but is nervous.
PADMÉ
There was a very old man who lived on the island. He used to make
glass out of sand – and vases and necklaces out of the glass. They
were magical.
ANAKIN
(looks in her eyes)
Everything here is magical.
PADMÉ
You could look into the glass and see the water. The way it ripples
and moves. It looked so real… but it wasn’t.
50 CONTINUED: 50
ANAKIN
"Sometimes, when you believe something to be real, it becomes real."
"Real enough, anyway…"
They look into each other’s eyes. He touches her chin.
PADMÉ
"I used to think if you looked too deeply into the glass, you would lose"
yourself.
ANAKIN
I think it’s true…
ANAKIN kisses PADMÉ. She doesn’t resist. She comes to her
senses and pulls away.
PADMÉ
I shouldn’t have done that.
ANAKIN
"I’m sorry. When I’m around you, my mind is no longer my own."
PADMÉ
It’s the situation… the stress…
He looks at her.
ANAKIN
…the view.
"51 EXT. CORUSCANT, LANDING PLATFORM – LATE"
AFTERNOON 51
Obi-Wan’s Starfighter is ready for takeoff. OBI-WAN and MACE
WINDU stand beside it.
MACE WINDU
"Be wary, this disturbance in the Force is growing stronger."
OBI-WAN
I’m concerned for my Padawan. He is not ready to be on his own.
MACE WINDU
"He has exceptional skills. The Council is confident in its decision,"
"Obi-Wan. If the prophecy is true, he will be the one to bring balance"
to the Force.
OBI-WAN
But he still has much to learn. His skills have made him… well…
arrogant. I realize now what you and Master Yoda knew from the
"beginning… the boy was too old to start the training, and…"
OBI-WAN hesitates.
51 CONTINUED: 51
MACE WINDU
There’s something else?
OBI-WAN
"Master, we should not have been given this assignment. I’m afraid"
Anakin won’t be able to protect the Senator.
MACE WINDU
Why?
OBI-WAN
He has a… an emotional connection with her. It’s been there since he
was a boy. Now he’s confused… distracted.
MACE WINDU
"Obi-Wan, you must have faith that he will take the right path."
OBI-WAN climbs into the cockpit of the Starfighter.
OBI-WAN
Has Master Yoda gained any insight into whether or not this war will
come about?
MACE WINDU
Probing the Dark Side is a dangerous process. He could be in
seclusion for days… May The Force Be With You.
The canopy closes. MACE WINDU watches as the Starfighter takes
off.
"52 INT. JEDI TEMPLE, YODA’S QUARTERS – LATE"
AFTERNOON 52
"YODA sits with his eyes closed, meditating. Silence."
"53 EXT. NAB00 LAKE RETREAT, LODGE – LATE AFTERNOON 53"
The setting sun touches the mountain peaks. The lake glows in the
rose-tinted light. Floating lamps gleam softly like jewels at the lodge.
"54 INT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, DINING ROOM – LATE"
AFTERNOON 54
NANDI places dessert in front of PADMÉ. TECKLA does the same for
ANAKIN. The dessert is some kind of fruit. PADMÉ picks up her fork
"and goes to spear a piece, but it moves! She frowns and tries again –"
the fruit moves. She looks up at ANAKIN. His eyes are on his plate.
PADMÉ
You did that?
ANAKIN looks up – wide-eyed innocence.
54 CONTINUED: 54
ANAKIN
What?
PADMÉ scowls at him. PADMÉ jabs at the fruit – Anakin subtly
moves his hand and it lifts up from the plate and hovers in front of
her!
PADMÉ
That! Now stop it!
PADMÉ laughs. ANAKIN laughs. She reaches out for the fruit – it
loops.
PADMÉ
(continuing)
Anakin!!
ANAKIN moves his fingers. The fruit flies into his hand.
ANAKIN
"I’m not really-supposed to do that… for fun, I mean. If Master Obi-"
"Wan were here, he’d be very grumpy."
ANAKIN is pleased. He cuts the fruit into several pieces and sends
one back to PADMÉ. She bites it out of the air and laughs.
"55 INT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, FIREPLACE ALCOVE –"
TWILIGHT 55
"A fire blazes in the open hearth. PADMÉ is sitting in front of it, gazing"
into the flames.
She looks up as ANAKIN arrives. She makes room for him. Brief
pause.
ANAKIN
May I tell you something?
PADMÉ
I don’t know.
ANAKIN
Then how can I tell you?
PADMÉ
Maybe you should use your Jedi intuition.
ANAKIN
It doesn’t work around you. My mind is always a muddle… I can only
think of you.
PADMÉ
"Anakin, don’t…"
ANAKIN
"From the moment I met you, all those years ago, a day hasn’t gone"
by when I haven’t thought of you.
(more)
55 CONTINUED: 55
ANAKIN(cont’d)
"And now that I’m with you again, I’m in agony. The closer I get to you,"
the worse it gets. The thought of not being with you makes my
stomach turn over – my mouth go dry. I feel dizzy. I can’t breathe. I’m
haunted by the kiss you should never have given me. My heart is
"beating, hoping that kiss will not become a scar. You are in my very"
"soul, tormenting me. What can I do? I will do anything you ask…"
Silence. The logs flame in the hearth.
ANAKIN
(continuing)
"If you are suffering as much as I am, tell me."
PADMÉ
…I can’t. We can’t. It’s just not possible.
ANAKIN
"Anything’s possible. Padmé, please listen…"
PADMÉ
You listen. We live in a real world. Come back to it. You’re studying to
become a Jedi Knight. I’m a Senator. If you follow your thoughts
"through to conclusion, they will take us to a place we cannot go…"
regardless of the way we feel about each other.
ANAKIN
Then you do feel something! There’s an extraordinary connection
between us. You’can’t deny that.
PADMÉ
"Annie, it doesn’t make any difference. Jedi aren’t allowed to marry."
"You swore an oath, remember? You’d be expelled from the Order. I"
"will not let you give up your responsibilities… your future, for me."
ANAKIN
I was destined to be a Jedi. I don’t think I could be anything else. But
"you are asking me to be rational, that is something I know I cannot"
do. I wish I could wish my feelings away… but I can’t.
55 CONTINUED: (2) 55
PADMÉ
I am not going to give in to this. I’m not going to throw my life away. I
have more imortant things to do than fall in love.
There is silence as they stare at the fire. ANAKIN is thinking.
ANAKIN
It wouldn’t have to be that way… we could keep it a secret.
PADMÉ
Then we’d be living a lie – one we couldn’t keep up even if we wanted
"to. My sister saw it. So did my mother. I couldn’t do that, could you,"
Anakin? Could you live like that?
Silence for a moment.
ANAKIN
"…No, you’re right. It would destroy us."
56 EXT. SPACE 56
"It’s just like the star map hologram, plus the storm-shrouded planet of"
"Kamino, which is exactly where it ought to be. Obi-Wan’s starship"
flies OVER CAMERA and heads down toward the planet.
"57 EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM"
(RAINSTORM) – DAY 57
Heavy rains and hard-driving winds lash the platform as Obi-Wan’s
"Starship approaches. The huge, ultra-modern city of Tipoca rests on"
great stilts that keep it above the pounding and ever-present waves
that cover the surface of this watery world.
The Starfighter lands. OBI-WAN gets out and makes his way through
the howling wind toward a tower on the far side of the platform. A
door slides open. A shaft of brilliant light pierces the swirling rain.
OBI-WAN passes through it and goes inside.
"58 INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR ENTRANCE – DAY 58"
Brilliant white light. OBI-WAN pushes the soaking hood from his face.
TAUN WE
"Welcome to Tipoca City, Master Jedi."
"OBI-WAN wipes the rain from his face and blinks in surprise at a tall,"
"pasty-white alien named TAUN WE. He has large, almond-shaped"
eyes.
TAUN WE
(continuing)
Everything is ready. The Prime Minister expects you.
58 CONTINUED 58
OBI-WAN
(warily)
I’m expected?
TAUN WE
"Of course! He is anxious to see you. After all these years, we were"
"beginning to think you weren’t coming. Now please, this way!"
OBI-WAN masks his surprise as they move away along the corridor.
"59 INT. TIPOCA CITY, PRIME MINISTER OFFICE – DAY"
The door slides open. OBI-WAN and TAUN WE enter and cross to
"where LAMA SU rises, smiling, from behind his desk, which, like all"
"the furniture on Kamino, seems made out of pure light."
TAUN WE
"May I present Lama Su, Prime Minister of Kamino… and this is"
Master Jedi…
OBI-WAN
Obi-Wan Kenobi.
LAMA SU
Please…
LAMA SU indicates a chair. OBI-WAN sits. TAUN WE hovers. The
room is bathed in brilliant white light. The whole place is ultra-hightech.
LAMA SU
I trust you are going to enjoy your stay. We are most happy you have
arrived at the best part of the season.
OBI-WAN
You make me feel most welcome.
LAMA SU
And now to business. You will be delighted to hear we are on
"schedule. Two hundred thousand units are ready, with another million"
well on the way.
OBI-WAN
(improvising)
That is… good news.
LAMA SU
Please tell your Master Sido-Dyas that we have every confidence his
"order will be met on time and in full. He is well, I hope?"
OBI-WAN
I’m sorry Master – ?
LAMA SU
Jedi Master Sido-Dyas. He’s still a leading member of the Jedi
"Council, is he not?"
OBI-WAN
"Oh, yes. Sido-Dyas."
LAMA SU
(rising)
You must be anxious to inspect the units for yourself.
OBI-WAN
(rising)
That’s why I’m here.
"60 EXT. NABOO, MOUNTAIN MEADOW – LATER AFTERNOON 60"
"PADMÉ and ANAKIN are in the middle of an idyllic hilly meadow, its"
"lush grasses sprinkled with flowers. At a distance, a herd of SHAAKS"
grazes contentedly.
Beyond is the shimmering expanse of the lake. Several other lakes
stretch to the horizon. The warm air is full of little floating puffballs.
"They sit on the grass, in a playful, coy mood, talking. PADMÉ is"
picking flowers.
PADMÉ
I don’t know…
ANAKIN
Sure you do… you just don’t want to tell me.
PADMÉ
Are you going to use one of your Jedi mind tricks on me?
ANAKIN
They only work on the weak-minded. You are anything but weakminded.
PADMÉ
All right… his name was Palo. I was twelve. We were both in the
Legislative Youth Program. He was a few years older then I… very
cute… dark curly hair… dreamy eyes.
ANAKIN
"All right, I get the picture… whatever happened to him?"
PADMÉ
I went on to become a Queen. He went on to become an artist.
ANAKIN
Maybe he was the smart one.
60 CONTINUED: 60
PADMÉ
"You really don’t like politicians, do you?"
ANAKIN
"I like two or three, but I’m not really sure about one of them."
(smiling)
I don’t think the system works.
PADMÉ
How would you have it work?
ANAKIN
We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the
"problems, agree what’s in the best interests of all the people, and"
then do it.
PADMÉ
That is exactly what we do. The trouble is that people don’t always
"agree. In fact, they hardly ever do."
ANAKIN
Then they should be made to.
PADMÉ
By whom? Who’s going to make them?
ANAKIN
I don’t know. Someone.
PADMÉ
You?
ANAKIN
Of course not me.
PADMÉ
But someone.
ANAKIN
Someone wise.
PADMÉ
That sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me.
A mischievious little grin creeps across his face.
ANAKIN
"Well, if it works…"
"PADMÉ stares at ANAKIN. He looks back at her, straight-faced, but"
can’t hold a smile.
PADMÉ
You’re making fun of me!
60 CONTINUED: (2) 60
ANAKIN
(sarcastic)
"On no, I’d be much too frightened to tease a Senator."
PADMÉ
You’re so bad!
PADMÉ picks up a piece of fruit and throws it at him. He catches it.
"PADMÉ throws two more pieces of fruit, and ANAKIN catches them."
ANAKIN
You’re always so serious. Always carrying the weight of the universe
on your shoulders.
ANAKIN then starts to juggle the fruit. PADMÉ laughs and throws
more fruit at him. He manages to juggle them too until there are too
"many, and he loses control and ducks, letting food fall on his head."
They both laugh.
"ANAKIN stands in front of a SHAAK, yelling at it and waving his arms."
"PADMÉ starts laughing as ANAKIN runs in circles, chased by the"
SHAAK.
"The SHAAK crosses in front of PADMÉ. ANAKIN is riding it, facing"
"the Shaak’s tail. The SHAAK bucks, and ANAKIN falls off. PADMÉ"
laughs even harder. ANAKIN lies still. PADMÉ jumps uip and runs to
where ANAKIN is face down in the grass. She turns him over. He is
pulling a stupid face at her. She yelps in mock fury and takes a swing
at him. He catches her arm. She struggles. They roll over in the
"grass. Suddenly, they become aware of the contact between them."
"They let go of each other quickly and sit up, looking away."
ANAKIN stands up and holds out his hand to her. She takes it. He
"pulls her up. And now they are easy together, not self-conscious any"
more. PADMÉ scrambles up onto the SHAAK behind ANAKIN. She
puts her arms around his waist and leans against his back. ANAKIN
"digs his heels in. The SHAAK starts forward, and they ride away."
"61 EXT. TIPOCA CITY, PARADE GROUND (RAINSTORM) –"
DAY 61
"OBI-WAN, LAMA SU and TAUN WE come out onto a balcony. Below"
is a huge parade ground. The rain and wind are brutal. THOUSANDS
"OF STORMTROOPERS, faces covered by helmets, are marching"
and drilling in formations of several hundred.
LAMA SU
(beaming)
"Magnificent, aren’t they?"
OBI-WAN nods slowly.
"62 INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, COMMISSARY – DAY 62"
LAMA SU conducts OBI-WAN through a large eating area. TAUN WE
follows as they walk by HUNDREDS OF CLONES who look exactly
"alike, all about twenty years old, dressed in black. They are seated at"
"tables, eating."
62 CONTINUED: 62
LAMA SU
We modified their genetic structure to make them less independent
"than the original host. As a result they are totally obedient, taking any"
order without question.
OBI-WAN
Who was the original host?
LAMA SU
A bounty hunter called Jango Fett. We felt a Jedi would be the perfect
"choice, but Sido-Dyas hand-picked Jango Fett himself."
OBI-WAN
Where is this bounty hunter now?
LAMA SU
"Oh, we keep him here. After a few hundred thousand clones, the"
"genetic pattern starts to fade, so we take a fresh supply. He lives"
"here, but he’s free to come and go as he pleases."
"63 INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, BARRACKS – DAY 63"
"The tour continues through a long corridor filled with narrow,"
"transparent tubes into which CLONES are climbing. Once in the tube,"
the CLONE goes to sleep.
LAMA SU
"Apart from his pay, which is considerable, Fett demanded only one"
"thing – an unaltered clone for himself. Curious, isn’t it?"
OBI-WAN
Unaltered?
LAMA SU
Pure genetic replication. No tampering with the structure to make it
more docile… and no growth acceleration…
OBI-WAN
I would like to meet this Jango Fett.
TAUN WE
"I would be most happy to arrange it, for you."
"TAUN WE bows, and leaves."
"64 INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, CLASSROOM – DAY 64"
The tour continues through a classroom filled with IDENTICAL
YOUNG BOY CLONES.
OBI-WAN
You mentioned growth acceleration…
LAMA SU
"Oh yes, it’s essential."
"Otherwise, a mature clone would take a lifetime to grow. Now, we can"
do it in half the time. Those items you saw on the parade ground
"were started ten years ago, when Sido-Dyas first placed the order,"
and they’re already mature…
OBI-WAN looks at the BOY CLONES.
OBI-WAN
And these?
LAMA SU
About five years ago.
"65 INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, HATCHERY – DAY 65"
"They enter a space filled with great racks of glass spheres, which are"
filled with fluid in which EMBRYOS are suspended.
LAMA SU
"They’re immensely superior to droids, capable of independent"
thought and action.
OBI-WAN
Very impressive.
LAMA SU
I’d hoped you would be pleased.
OBI-WAN gazes at the nearest embryos.
OBI-WAN
(carefully)
"Tell me, Prime Minister, when my Master Sido-Dyas first contacted"
"you, did he say the order was for… himself… or…?"
LAMA SU
Himself? Of course not. This army is for the Republic!
OBI-WAN
(astonished)
The Republic?
LAMA SU
We are also very much agasint this Count Dooku and his
seccessionist movement. We are proud to be of help to the Republic.
"66 INT. TIPOCA CITY, APARTMENT – LATE DAY 66"
TAUN WE shows OBI-WAN into his room.
TAUN WE
I have arranged for you to meet Jango Fett in the morning. Sleep
well.
TAUN WE goes. The door slides closed behind him. OBI-WAN looks
"around, then moves swiftly to check the room over. Finally, satisfied,"
he takes out his comlink.
OBI-WAN
"Arfour, Arfour…"
"67 EXT. TIPOCA CITY LANDING PLATFORM, JEDI FIGHTER,"
(RAINSTORM) – LATE DAY
"The R4 D17, Obi-Wan’s Astro-Droid, who is sitting on top of Obi-"
"Wan’s Starfighter, switches on and BEEPS."
"68 INT. TIPOCA CITY, APARTMENT – LATE DAY 68"
OBI-WAN hears ARFOUR BEEP through his comlink.
OBI-WAN
"Arfour, relay this, “scramble code five,” to Courscant: care of “the old"
folks home.”
"69 EXT. TIPOCA CITY LANDING PLATFORM, JEDI FIGHTER,"
(RAINSTORM) – LATE DAY
ARFOUR BEEPS and WHISTLES. The panels light up inside the
"cockpit, as the message is transmitted."
"70 EXT. JEDI TEMPLE, LIVING QUARTERS – EARLY EVENING 70"
YODA and MACE WINDU listen as a hologram of OBI-WAN stands
"between them broadcasting the massage. The signal is very weak,"
the image fades in and out.
OBI-WAN (V.O.)
"…I’ve never heard of a Jedi called Sido-Dyas, have you, Master?"
MACE WINDU
"No. Whoever placed that order was not a Jedi, I can assure you."
OBI-WAN (V.O.)
I have a strong feeling that this bounty hunter is the assassin we’re
looking for.
71 CONTINUED: 71
YODA
"Who he is working for… discover that, you must."
OBI-WAN (V.O.)
"I will, Master, and I will also find out more about this clone army…"
May The Force…
"The hologram switches off, and OBI-WAN fades away."
MACE WINDU
A clone army! Ordered by someone in the Senate perhaps…
Someone’s out to start a war.
YODA
"Inform the chancellor of this, we must."
MACE WINDU
"Who do you think this imposter, Sido-Dyas could be?"
"YODA stares back at MACE WINDU, then slowly shakes his head."
72 EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT – NIGHT 72
The silent lodge. The triple moons of Naboo reflected in the tranquil
waters of the lake.
"73 INT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, ANAKIN’S BEDROOM –"
NIGHT 73
ANAKIN moves restlessly in his sleep. He mutters to himself. Sweat
forms on his forehead. He turns violently. He cries out.
ANAKIN
"No… No… No… Mom!… Don’t, no, don’t!"
"74 EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, BALCONY"
OVERLOOKING GARDENS – MORNING
"ANAKIN is on the balcony overlooking the gardens. After a moment,"
PADMÉ comes onto the balcony behind him. She sees he is
meditating and turns to go.
ANAKIN
(eyes closed)
Don’t go.
PADMÉ
I don’t want to disturb you.
ANAKIN
Your presence is soothing.
Brief pause.
74 CONTINUED: 74
PADMÉ
You had a nightmare again last night.
ANAKIN
Jedi don’t have nightmares.
PADME
I heard you.
ANAKIN opens his eyes and looks at her.
ANAKIN
I saw my mother. I saw her as clearly as I see you now. She is
"suffering, Padmé. She is in pain… They’re killing her!"
(getting up)
"I know I’m disobeying my mandate to protect you, Senator. I know I"
"will be punished and possibly thrown out of the Jedi Order, but I must"
"go. I have to help her! I’m sorry, Padmé. I don’t have a choice."
PADMÉ
"Annie, I told you I wouldn’t let you give up your future for me. I’ll go"
"with you. That way you can continue to protect me, and you won’t be"
disobeying your mandate.
ANAKIN
What about Master Obi-wan?
PADMÉ smiles and takes his hand.
PADMÉ
"I guess we won’t tell him, will we?"
"75 EXT. NABOO LAKE, FLOATING LANDING PLATFORM –"
DAY 75
ANAKIN and PADMÉ step onto the landing platform from the water
"speeder. They enter the Naboo Starship. ARTOO BEEPS, and"
follows them on board. The ramp retracts.
PADDY ACCU drives the water speeder away from the platform as
Anakin’s Starship takes off.
76 EXT. TIPOCA CITY (RAINSTORM) – DAY 76
"Rain lashes the city. Below, mightly waves pound the stilts, breaking"
almost to the height of the platforms.
"77 INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR – DAY 77"
TAUN WE conducts OBI-WAN to the door of Jango Fett’s apartment.
"TAUN WE waves his hand, and a muted bell RINGS."
77 CONTINUED: 77
"As they wait, OBI-WAN notes the door lock entry mechanism. Then"
"the door opens, and a ten-year-old boy, BOBA FETT, looks at them."
He is identical to the boys in the classroom.
TAUN WE
"Boba, is your father here?"
"There is a brief pause, then BOBA FETT nods."
TAUN WE
(continuing)
May we see him?
BOBA FETT
Sure.
"Another brief pause, then BOBA FETT steps aside, and TAUN WE"
and OBI-WAN go through.
"78 INT. TIPOCA CITY, FETT APARTMENT – DAY 78"
"OBI-WAN, TAUN WE, and BOBA FETT enter the apartment. OBIWAN"
looks around the room.
BOBA FETT
Dad! Taun We’s here!
JANGO FETT comes in from the bedroom. He wears a jumpsuit. He
"is unshaven and mean looking, his face pitted with scars of old"
wounds. There are a couple of weird tattoos on his muscular
forearms. He eyes OBI-WAN with suspicion.
TAUN WE
"Welcome back, Jango. Was your trip productive?"
JANGO FETT
Fairly.
OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT size each other up. BOBA FETT studies
both of them.
TAUN WE
"This is Jedi Master, Obi-Wan Kenobi. He’s come to check on our"
progress.
JANGO FETT
That right?
JANGO FETT’s eyes fix OBI-WAN coldly.
OBI-WAN
Your clones are very impressive. You must be very proud.
JANGO FETT
"I’m just a simple man, trying to make my way in the universe, Master"
Jedi.
OBI-WAN
Aren’t we all?
78 CONTINUED: 78
"OBI-WAN eyes the half-open bedroom door, through which a couple"
of pieces of body armour can be seen on the floor. JANGO FETT
"registers OBI-WAN’S look. He moves in front of him, blocking the"
view.
OBI-WAN
(continuing)
Ever make your way as far into the interior as Coruscant?
JANGO FETT
Once or twice.
OBI-WAN
Recently?
JANGO FETT
(eyes Obi-Wan carefully)
Possibly…
OBI-WAN
Then you must know Master Sido-Dyas?
JANGO FETT
"Boba, close the door."
BOBA FETT moves to close the bedroom door. JANGO FETT smiles
thinly at OBI-WAN.
JANGO FETT
(continuing)
Master who?
OBI-WAN
Sido-Dyas. Isn’t he the Jedi who hired you for this job?
JANGO FETT
Never heard of him. I was recuited by a man called Darth Tyranus on
one of the moons of Bogden.
OBI-WAN
No? I thought…
TAUN WE
Sido-Dyas told us to expect him. And he showed up just when your
Jedi Master said he would. We have kept the Jedi’s involvement a
"secret until your arrival, just as your Master requested."
OBI-WAN
Curious…
JANGO FETT
Do you like your army?
78 CONTINUED: (2) 78
OBI-WAN
It seems to me it’s your army – being that they are all clones of you.
JANGO FETT
(grinning)
"They’ll do their job well, I’ll guarantee that."
OBI-WAN
"I look forward to seeing them in action. Thank you for your time,"
Jango.
JANGO FETT
Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi.
OBI-WAN and TAUN WE go out. The door slides closed. JANGO
FETT turns to his son. He is deep in thought.
BOBA FETT
"What is it, Dad?"
79 EXT. SPACE 79
The Naboo Starship heads toward the desert planet of Tatooine.
"80 EXT. TATOOINE, MOS ESPA STREETS AND WATTO’S SHIP –"
DAY 80
The Naboo Starship lands in a large parking lot of Spaceships on the
outskirts of Mos Espa. ANAKIN and PADMÉ ride a rickshaw through
"the streets. ANAKIN stares at sights he hasn’t seen for years. Finally,"
"they come to Watto’s shop, and the rickshaw stops."
ANAKIN
(to the droid driver)
"Wait, please."
ANAKIN and PADMÉ get down. Sitting on a stool in front of the shop
is WATTO. He is using a small electronic screwdriver on a fiddly
DROID. THREE PIT DROIDS are chattering away and are trying to
"help him, but they seem only to make him madder."
WATTO
"(yelling, in Huttese)"
"No, not that one – that one!"
ANAKIN
(arriving)
"Excuse me, Watto."
WATTO
(in Huttese)
What?
ANAKIN
(in Huttese)
I said excuse me.
WATTO turns to the chattering PIT DROIDS.
WATTO
(in Huttese)
Shut down.
The PIT DROIDS snap into their storage position.
WATTO
"(continuing, in Huttese)"
What? I don’t know you… What can I do for you? You look like a
Jedi. Whatever it is… I didn’t do it.
WATTO drops the screwdriver and curses loudly in Huttese
ANAKIN
Let me help you with that.
ANAKIN takes the fiddly piece of equipment and starts to play with it.
WATTO blinks in surprise.
ANAKIN
(continuing)
I’m looking for Shmi Skywalker.
"WATTO looks at him suspiciously. He stares at PADMÉ, then back to"
ANAKIN.
WATTO
Annie?? Little Annie?? Naaaah!!
"Suddenly, the fiddly piece of equipment in Anakin’s hands WHIRS"
into life. WATTO blinks at it.
WATTO
(continuing; in
English)
You are Annie! It is you! You little womp rat.
WATTO gives ANAKIN a big hug.
WATTO
(continuing)
"You sure sprouted! Weehoo! A Jedi! Waddya know? Hey, maybe you"
couldda help wit some deadbeats who owe…
ANAKIN
My mother…
WATTO
"Oh, yeah. Shmi… she’s not mine no more. I sold her."
ANAKIN
Sold her…
WATTO
"Years ago. Sorry, Annie, but you know, business is business."
(more)
80 CONTINUED: (2) 80
WATTO (cont’d)
Sold her to a moisture farmer named Lars. Least I think it was Lars.
"Believe it or not, I heard he freed her and married her. Can ya beat"
that?
ANAKIN
Do you know where they are?
WATTO
Long way from here… someplace over on the other side of Mos
"Eisley, I think…"
ANAKIN
I’d like to know.
ANAKIN’S grim look means business; WATTO gets the hint quickly.
WATTO
Yeah… sure… absolutely. Let’s go look in my records.
ANAKIN and WATTO go into the shop.
81 EXT. TIPOCA CITY (RAINSTORM) – DAY 81
The waves crash against the water city as the storm continues. Light
suddenly streams from the base of a landing platform as a door slides
open.
"82 INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR – DAY 82"
OBI-WAN stands with LAMA SU and TAUN WE just inside the open
door.
LAMA SU
Tell your Council the first battalions are ready. And remind them that
"if they need more troops, we will need time to grow them."
OBI-WAN
I won’t forget.
"83 EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM"
(RAINSTORM) – DAY
OBI-WAN comes out from the tower into the driving rain. The door
closes behind him. He pulls his robe around him and stands braced
against the gale.
"Below, a huge wave crashes against the stilts. Spray flies high and"
whips across the platform where OBI-WAN is standing. He walks
"over to his Starfighter, looks to see if anyone is watching, then turns"
and goes back to the door. It slides open.
"84 INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR – DAY 84"
"OBI-WAN enters cautiously from outside. Ahead, the corridor is"
deserted. He moves down it.
"85 INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR OUTSIDE FETT APARTMENT –"
DAY 85
OBI-WAN arrives at the door to Jango Fett’s apartment. He reaches
"up and runs his fingers along the door, locating the lock. The door"
slides open.
"86 INT. TIPOCA CITY, FETT APARTMENT – DAY 86"
OBI-WAN walks in to find the room in complete disorder. The
bedroom door is wide open – clear signs of hurried departure. All of
the Fetts’ personal belongings are gone.
OBI-WAN goes to an ultra-thin computer screen. He punches up AN
ONSCREEN PICTURE of JANGO FETT and BOBA FETT unhitching
the lines securing their ship to the landing platform. JANGO FETT is
wearing his armour and rocket pack. BOBA FETT climbs aboard the
small Fighter.
"87 EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM"
(RAINSTORM) – DAY
"JANGO FETT picks up a case and swings it up to BOBA FETT, who"
stows it inside the ship. JANGO FETT picks up another case and is
"about to swing it, when:"
BOBA FETT
Dad!!
JANGO FETT turns to see OBI-WAN charging out of the tower
"toward him. As he runs, OBI-WAN draws his lightsaber from his belt."
It flashes on.
JANGO FETT draws his gun and fires at the charging JEDI. OBIWAN
deflects the blast and swings at JANGO FETT.
"The bounty hunter rockets up and over OBI-WAN, landing behind"
"him. He fires a thin wire from his wrist pack, trying to entangle the"
Jedi.
JANGO FETT fire several Kamino Kyber Darts from his elbow
"launcher. OBI-WAN deflects them back at JANGO FETT, but they"
strike harmlessly against the bounty hunter’s armour.
"IN THE COCKPIT of Jango Fett’s ship, BOBA FETT grabs the"
controls of a laser gun and swings it to aim at OBI-WAN.
"OUTSIDE, in the driving rain, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT circle"
"each other, sizing each other up – feinting."
"IN THE COCKPIT, each time BOBA FETT is ready to fire, JANGO"
FETT blocks his view of OBI-WAN.
"OUTSIDE, OBI-WAN makes a sudden attack, swinging at JANGO"
"FETT, who deflects the blows. One slices off a piece of the bounty"
hunter’s shoulder plate. JANGO FETT rockets into the air and hovers
above OBI-WAN. The Jedi spins as:
"IN THE COCKPIT, BOBA FETT fires."
87 CONTINUED 87
"OUTSIDE, the laser shell streaks past OBI-WAN to strike the edge of"
the tower. JANGO FETT fires down at OBI-WAN. The Jedi deflects
"the shots back, but JANGO FETT evades them. Then he swoops"
"down, swinging around OBI-WAN. As he shoots past, he kicks the"
lightsaber out of the Jedi’s hand.
The lightsaber skids across the wet surface of the landing platform.
OBI-WAN dives after it. JANGO FETT zooms in front of him and
grabs the lightsaber. OBI-WAN punches it out of his hand.
"IN THE COCKPIT, BOBA FETT watches as:"
"OUTSIDE, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT grapple and fight, punching,"
"kicking, grabbing hold, and throwing each other around. OBI-WAN"
"grabs JANGO FETT tightly, and JANGO FETT rockets up into the air"
and kicks OBI-WAN loose. OBI-WAN crashes to the deck and slides
toward the edge. He grapples desperately for a handhold on the slick
surface.
JANGO FETT rockets down to kick at him. OBI-WAN hauls himself
up. JANGO FETT zooms to the far side of the platform.
OBI-WAN uses Jedi powers to pull part of the structure loose. It hits
"JANGO FETT, who loses his balance, teetering on the edge. OBIWAN"
"charges acress, dives, and grabs hold of JANGO FETT just as"
he falls over the edge.
"Locked together, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT plummet down toward"
"the raging ocean. At the last moment, JANGO FETT fires a cable out"
of his backpack that shoots upward and locks onto a metal strut on
the underside of the platform. OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT swing
and CRASH onto one of the stilts.
OBI-WAN is knocked clear and drops onto a SMALL SERVICE
PLATFORM just above the waves. He hauls himself to his feet.
"JANGO FETT hovers in mid-air opposite him, as a HUGE WAVE"
"crashes over OBI-WAN. When it subsides, the Jedi has disappeared."
"JANGO FETT rockets up to the landing platform, where he drops"
down beside his ship. He clambers inside the cockpit and settles into
the pilot’s seat. He punches buttons. The engines ROAR.
"OUTSIDE, Jango Fett’s ship lifts off from the platform and heads up"
into the lowering sky. It disappears. Lightning flashes. Rain lashes the
"tower and streams across the surface of the platform, to where:"
A HAND suddenlt clutches at the very edge of the platform. A
"moment later, ANOTHER HAND grabs hold."
"88 EXT. TATOOINE, BLUFF OVERLOOKING HOMESTEAD – LATE"
DAY 88
"The Naboo Starship descends, hovers, and land on a bluff. ANAKIN"
and PADMÉ get out. They look down from the edge of the bluff to
where the homestead is seen on the desert floor below.
PADME
"Stay with the ship, Artoo."
ARTOO WHISTLES as ANAKIN and PADMÉ start down the trail
toward the homestead.
"89 EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, HOMESTEAD MOISTURE FARM –"
LATE DAY 89
C-3PO is working outside the homestead. He still lacks an outer
covering; his inner parts and wiring show. He looks up as ANAKIN
"and PADMÉ arrive,"
C-3PO
Good evening. May I help you?
ANAKIN
Threepio?
C-3PO
"Oh, my… oh, my! Master Anakin! My goodness, I can hardly believe"
it! And this must be Miss Padmé.
PADMÉ
"Hello, Threepio."
ANAKIN
I’ve come to see my mother.
C-3PO
"Oh, dear! I’m so terribly sorry, Master Annie."
PADMÉ
"Threepio, what’s happened?"
C-3PO
I think we’d better go inside.
"89 EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, COURTYARD – LATE DAY 89"
"ANAKIN, PADMÉ and THREEPIO arrive in the courtyard. THREEPIO"
shuffles ahead.
C-3PO
Master Lars – Master Owen! Somebody to see you!
OWEN LARS and BERU WHITESUN come out into the courtyard.
ANAKIN
I’m Anakin Skywalker. I’m here looking for my mother.
OWEN
Owen Lars… I guess I’m your step-brother.
(they shake hands)
"This is my girlfriend, Beru."
BERU
Hello.
PADMÉ
I’m Padmé.
OWEN
I had a feeling you might show up some day.
90 CONTINUED: 90
ANAKIN
Is my mother here?
CLIEGG
"No, she’s not."
CLIEGG LARS swings from the house on a small floating chair. One
of his legs is heavily bandaged; the other is missing. He balances
awkwardly and puts out a hand.
CLIEGG
(continuing)
Cliegg Lars. Shmi is my wife… Come on inside. We have a lot to talk
about.
"91 INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, KITCHEN – LATE DAY 91"
BERU puts several steaming cups of ardees on a tray and exits the
kitchen…
CLIEGG (O.S.)
It was just before dawn. They came out of nowhere. A hunting party
of Tusken Raiders.
"92 INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, DINING AREA – LATE DAY 92"
"CLIEGG, OWEN, PADME and ANAKIN sit around the table, BERU"
brings the drinks from the kitchen.
CLIEGG
"Your mother had gone out early, like she always did, to pick"
"mushrooms that grow on the vaporatos. From the tracks, she was"
"about halfway when they took her. Those Tuskens walk like men, but"
"they’re vicious, mindless monsters. Thirty of us went out after her."
Four of us came back. Three more are still out there looking. I’d be
"with them, only… I just couldn’t ride any more… until I heal."
"CLIEGG grimaces, easing his throbbing leg."
CLIEGG
(continuing)
"This isn’t the way I wanted to meet you, son. This isn’t how your"
"mother and I planned it. I don’t want to give up on her, but she’s been"
gone a month. There’s little hope she’s lasted this long.
Silence. Then ANAKIN stands up.
OWEN
Where are you going?
92 CONTINUED: 92
ANAKIN
To find my mother.
PADMÉ
"No, Annie!"
CLIEGG
"She’s dead, son. Accept it."
ANAKIN
"I can feel her pain, and I will find her. I know she’s alive."
ANAKIN turns abruptly.
"93 EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, MOISTURE FARM – LATE"
DAY 93
ANAKIN stands looking across the desert. PADMÉ comes running
"out of the homestead after him, followed by OWEN. ANAKIN turns to"
PADMÉ.
ANAKIN
"You are going to have to stay here. These are good people, Padmé."
You’ll be safe.
OWEN
Take my speeder bike.
PADMÉ
Anakin…
"PADMÉ hugs him. ANAKIN walks over to Owen’s speeder bike,"
which is standing close by.
ANAKIN
"I trust you’ll watch over her, Owen."
OWEN
Don’t worry.
ANAKIN swings onto the bike. The engine fires.
ANAKIN
I won’t be long.
ANAKIN takes off across the desert. PADMÉ watches him go.
"94 EXT. SPACE, GEONOSIS 94"
The red planet of Geonosis is circled by a large asteroid field that
"form rings. Jango Fett’s ship appears, heading toward it."
"95 INT. COCKPIT, FETT SHIP, SPACE, GEONOSIS 95"
JANGO FETT grins at BOBA FETT.
JANGO FETT
"Nearly there, son."
95 CONTINUED: 95
JANGO FETT guides he ship around the asteroids. Suddenly:
BOBA FETT
"Dad, look!!"
"On the view screen, Obi-Wan’s ship appears, chasing after them."
JANGO FETT grabs the controls. They are thrown around as the ship
plummets to try to lose OBI-WAN.
JANGO FETT
Hang on!
The ship goes into a power-climb. A GREAT SPACE DDOGFIGHT
ensues between OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT.
"96 EXT. SPACE, GEONOSIS 96"
"The ships flip, roll, and turn at incredible speed, dodging, weaving"
and firing. They tumble from near misses. Hits fly off Obi-Wan’s
fighter as one of Jango’s missiles gets through.
"Finally, it seems as if OBI-WAN is getting the upper hand. JANGO"
FETT breaks off the fight and dives sharply. He maneuvers deftly
between two huge asteroids.
"In JANGO FETT’S COCKPIT, BOBA FETT flinches as asteroids pass"
very close by.
BOBA FETT
Dad! Watch out!
JANGO FETT
"Stay calm, son. We’ll be fine. That Jedi won’t be able to follow us"
through this.
But Obi-Wan ship dives into the asteroid belt after them.
"IN OBI-WAN’S COCKPIT, his skill is pushed to the limit as he throws"
"the ship from side to side, avoiding great rocks. Then a huge asteroid"
tumbles across his path. There seem no way he can avoid it. OBIWAN
fires a couple of aerial torpedoes. They streak toward the
asteroid.
"IN JANGO’S COCKPIT, they see the huge explosion as Obi-Wan’s"
ship appears to smash into the asteroid.
BOBA FETT
Got him! Yeahhhhh!
JANGO FETT
We won’t see him again.
BOBA FETT laughs. Jango Fett’s ship emerges from the asteroid belt
and heads down toward the planet of Geonosis.
"97 EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, JAWA CAMP – SUNSET 97"
ANAKIN stands in the middle of a crowd of JAWAS. He asks them
"from directions. The JAWAS confer exicitedly, then the CHIEF JAWA"
points in a particular direction. ANAKIN gets on the bike and speeds
off to where the JAWA pointed.
"98 EXT. TATOOINE, DUNE SEA, CAMPFIRE – TWILIGHT 98"
ANAKIN rides over a large dune toward a small flickering light in the
distance.
He rides up and stops the bike in front of a campfire. There are
bodies of THREE DEAD FARMERS lying beside the campfire. TWO
"EOPIES are thethered nearby, along with a burned and smoking"
speeder.
"99 EXT. TATOOINE, LANDSCAPE (FULL MOON) – NIGHT 99"
THREE DIFFERENT SHOTS. ANAKIN rids the speeder bike through
"three exotic landscapes. In one shot, he stops and looks down at"
some tracks. Then he starts up his speeder and rides off.
"100 EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, HOMESTEAD (FULL MOON) –"
NIGHT 100
The lights of the vaporators blink in the night sky. Somewhere close
"by, a night animal HOWLS."
"101 EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, COURTYARD (FULL MOON)"
– NIGHT 101
"PADMÉ is pacing the courtyard restlessly. She stops, listening to the"
"animal HOWLING nearby. She shivers slightly, then turns and goes"
into the garage at the side of the courtyard.
"102 INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD – GARAGE (FULL MOON) –"
NIGHT 102
PADMÉ stands looking at a speeder parked in the garage. Short
silence. Then:
C-3PO
"Please don’t leave us, Miss Padmé. These people need your help."
THREEPIO is parked in a corner.
PADMÉ
"I’m not leaving, Threepio. I just can’t sleep."
C-3PO
"That’s something I cannot relate to. As a Protocol Droid, I’m either"
active or inactive. There’s no in-between.
PADMÉ
I guess you’re lucky.
C-3PO
Do you really think so..? I suppose I shouldn’t expect…
PADMÉ
You’re not happy here?
102 CONTINUED: 102
C-3PO
"Oh, I’m not unhappy… and my masters here ar so kind I wouldn’t"
"wish to trouble them, it’s just… being like this… well, it’s"
embarrassing.
PADMÉ
Being like what?
C-3PO
"Naked. If you pardon the expression. You see, when Master Annie"
"made me, he never quite found the time to give me any outer"
covering. It’s so humiliating. How would you like it if you had to go
around with all your circuits showing?
PADMÉ
I guess I wouldn’t like it at all.
C-3PO
Of course you wouldn’t. Nobody would. It’s simply not protocol.
PADMÉ looks thoughtfully at a pile of spare parts and bits of metal
and tools.
PADMÉ
Maybe we can do something about it.
C-3PO
I don’t think so. Only Master Annie…
PADMÉ
Why not? They seem to have a box of old coverings here.
C-3PO
"Oh? How observant of you, Miss Padmé. Of course, I’m just not"
mechanically minded… if you see what I mean.
PADMÉ picks up a piece of metal and holds it against him.
PADMÉ
"Let’s see, if we put this… here…"
C-3PO
Ooooh! That’s tickles.
PADMÉ
"You’ll have to be quiet, Threepio. Hold still, please."
"103 EXT. SPACE, GEONOSIS RINGS 103"
A huge chunk of rock tumbles slowly through the asteroid belt.
"CAMERA CLOSES, to discover Obi-Wan’s Starship hidden in a"
blasted-out area on the pitted back side of the great rock.
"104 INT. COCKPIT, JEDI FIGHTER, SPACE, GEONOSIS"
RINGS 104
OBI-WAN looks out toward Geonosis and sees in the distance a large
fleet of Trade Federation Ships hidden among the asteroids. He
starts the engines of his Fighter.
104 CONTINUED: 104
Obi-Wan’s Fighter moves out from the back side of the asteroid and
"heads away from the asteroid field, descending toward Geonosis."
"105 EXT. GEONOSIS, LANDING AREA – NIGHT 105"
Obi-Wan’s ship skims across the top of a small mesa along the edge
of a rocky ridge. He maneuvers under a rock overhang and lands. He
gets out of the Fighter and walks onto the mesa. The wind whips at
him. He looks around.
"Geonosis is a red rock planet, featureless apart from buttes and"
"mesas, and occasional tall stalagmites that stand out dramatically on"
the arid plains.
"The night is quiet, except for an occasional WEIRD CRY. OBI-WAN"
"checks his bearings, then heads away."
"106 EXT. GEONOSIS, ROCK FACE TRAIL – NIGHT 106"
"OBI-WAN climbs a steep, narrow trail. Suddenly, a CRY is heard"
"close by. OBI-WAN stumbles slightly. His foot slips on the edge,"
sending a stream of peblles skittering into the darkness.
OBI-WAN listens. Silence. He draws his lightsaber but does not ignite
it.
"He sets off again and works his way around a narrow corner, to"
confront a crouching MASSIFF (a dog-sized lizard) with slavering
"fangs! The beast leaps at him, and OBI-WAN ignites his lightsaber as"
the MASSIFF knocks him on his back. Its jaws open wide. OBI-WAN
"stabs the creature, throws it off of him, and jumps up."
A SECOND MASSIFF jumps from behind. OBI-WAN swings around
"and cuts it in half. The MASSIFF flies over the cliff, HOWLING. It"
plummets to its death hundreds of feet below.
"107 EXT. TATOOINE, CLIFF (FULL MOON) – NIGHT 107"
ANAKIN pulls up near the edge of a cliff. He gets off the bike and
creeps to the edge. He looks over to see a Tusken camp in the oasis
below. One of the huts at the edge of the camp has TWO TUSKEN
GUARDS outside it.
"108 EXT. TATOOINE, TUSKEN RAIDER CAMP, OASIS (FULL"
MOON) – NIGHT
"ANAKIN creeps through the camp, working his way from hut to hut,"
"flattening himself against the walls, overhearing snatches of Tusken"
"conversation from inside, using the shadows to hide him until he"
arrives at the hut with the TWO GUARDS. They are sitting a short
distance from the door. ANAKIN wriggles around the back. He takes
out his lightsaber and cuts into the base of the wall.
109 INT. TUSKEN RAIDER HUT – NIGHT 109
The lightsaber completes the hole in the wall. ANAKIN wriggles in. He
pulls himself to his feet. There are candles everywhere.
A shaft of moonlight from a hole in the roof pierces the gloom of the
"hut. By its light, ANAKIN sees SHMI, hanging from a wooden frame in"
the middle of the hut.
109 CONTINUED 109
"He cuts her free, takes her into his arms, and lowers her gently to the"
ground. Her eyes are closed. Her face is bloodied. She has been
terribly beaten. Anakin cradles her tenderly.
ANAKIN
Mom… Mom… Mom…
SHMI’s eyelids flutter – and barely open. They are caked with blood.
SHMI
Annie…? Is it you?
SHMI’s eyes focus slowly. ANAKIN gives a little choking gasp.
ANAKIN
"I’m here, Mom. You’re safe. Hang on. I’m going to get you out of"
here…
SHMI
"I’m so glad… to see you, Annie… Now… I am complete…"
ANAKIN
"Just stay with me, Mom. I’m going to make you well again."
Everything’s going to be fine.
SHMI
You look so handsome. My son… my grown-up son. I’m so proud of
"you, Annie… so proud… I missed you so much… I love…"
SHMI dies. ANAKIN draws her to his breast. There is silence for a
"moment. ANAKIN lifts his head, listening for a moment, then he sits"
"on the floor of the Tusken hut, cradling his dead mother in his arms."
"110 EXT. GEONOSIS, ROCK FACE TRAIL – NIGHT 110"
"OBI-WAN arrives at the head of the trail. Far below, a flat plain"
"stretches into the distance. He stops, peering into the darkness,"
where strange shapes loom indistinctly.
OBI-WAN takes a pair of electronic binoculars from his belt and puts
them to his eyes. He sees a cluster of great towers like fantastic
stalagmites rise from the plain below.
"SLOW PAN with the binoculars, and suddenly a line of Battle"
Starships come into view. OBI-WAN touches the viewfinder. Between
fifty and a hundred Federation Starships in near rows. Some are on
platforms that are carrying the Starships down to an underground
facility. Other platforms are rising to the surface. They carry
THOUSANDS of BATTLE DROIDS that step off and file into the
waiting ships. A fully loaded Starship takes off. OBI-WAN swings the
"binoculars upward, to see more Federation Starships."
"111 EXT. TATOOINE, TUSKEN RAIDER CAMP, OASIS –"
DAWN 111
"The pale light grows. Thin tendrils of smoke rise slowly in the cold,"
clear air. Somewhere a dog BARKS. An OLD WOMAN comes out of
one of the huts. She carries a pail. She swirls it and tosses the dirty
water onto the ground.
"As she goes back inside the hut, a TUSKEN CHILD runs past,"
"dragging a stick in the sand. The CHILD runs through the line of huts,"
"turns a corner, and stops suddenly, staring at the bodies of the TWO"
"TUSKEN GUARDS. Between them, ANAKIN stands outside the hut"
"door. His face is a grim mask. The CHILD stares, then there is a"
FLASH OF LIGHT as Anakin’s lightsaber switches on.
"112 EXT. GEONOSIS, LANDING AREA – NIGHT 112"
OBI-WAN comes running back to his ship and climbs into the cockpit.
He settles into his seat. His ARFOUR DROID beeps a happy
greeting. OBI-WAN switches on his comlink.
OBI-WAN
“Guiding light” to “old folks home.”
"113 EXT. CORUSCANT, REPUBLIC EXECUTIVE BUILDING –"
DAY 113
LOW ANGLE. A line of reflecting pools with splashing fountains
flanked by statues on each side leads to the main entrance to the
awesome building.
"114 INT. CORUSCANT, CHANCELLOR’S OFFICE 114"
"A hologram of OBI-WAN flickers in front of a group, made up of Jedi"
"(YODA, MACE WINDU, and KI-ADI-MUNDI) and Senators (BAIL"
"ORGANA, ASK AAK, LUMINARA, and JAR JAR). PALPATINE and"
"MAS AMEDDA are in the middle of the group, watching with growing"
concern.
OBI-WAN
…Starships from the Trade Federation and the Commerce Guilds are
taking deliveries of battle droids from the foundries on Geonosis.
BAIL ORGANA
That’s outrageous! The treaty forbids the Trade Federation from
building up an army. What are they doing?!
OBI-WAN
The droid foundry seems to be working at full capacity. I am going to
go down and investigate. I will bring Jango Fett back home for
interrogation.
114 CONTINUED: 114
PALPATINE
Those Geonosian foundries are part of the Techno Union. We will call
in their representatives and ask them a few very pointed questions.
OBI-WAN
One more thing. Jango mentioned he was recruited by someone
named Darth Tyranus. Any idea who that might be?
YODA
"With the forename Darth, a Sith he must be."
MACE WINDU
Our missing apprentice. They are playing their hand at last.
OBI-WAN
"Do you believe he could be the mysterious Sido-Dyas, who made the"
deal for the clone army?
YODA
"Perhaps too many pieces missing from this puzzle, there are."
MACE WINDU
"Be careful, Obi-Wan. This investigation is becoming less than routine."
Do you need help?
OBI-WAN
Let me see if I can figure out what’s going on first.
The hologram of OBI-WAN fades off. PALPATINE stares at the spot
where the hologram was in disbelief.
BAIL ORGANA
The Commerce Guilds are preparing for war… there can be no doubt
of that.
PALPATINE
Count Dooku must have made a treaty with them.
MACE WINDU
We must stop them soon before they’re fully ready.
SENATOR ASK AAK
"The debate is over, now we need that clone army…"
BAIL ORGANA
"Unfortunately, the debate is not over. The Senate will never be able"
to approve the use of that army before the separatists attack.
114 CONTINUED: (2) 114
MAS AMEDDA
This is a crisis! If the Senate votes the Chancellor emergency
"powers, he could approve the use of the army, in a minute."
PALPATINE
"Please, please, I don’t wish to have emergency powers. That’s too"
extreme a solution. It’s akin to a dictatorship. We must rely on the
"Jedi. Master Yoda, how many are available to go to Geonosis?"
MACE WINDU and YODA look at one another.
YODA
"Two hundred,… less or more."
BAIL ORGANA
"With all due respect for the Jedi Order, two hundred will be no match"
for hundreds of thousands of battle droids.
MACE WINDU
Patience. We should wait for Obi-Wan to report back. We don’t know
"that Count Dooku has made a treaty with the Corporate Alliance, it’s"
speculation.
SENATOR ASK AAK
But we must prepare for the worst. I’m going to propose a motion
granting emergency powers to the Chancellor at the next session. We
must not wait!
PALPATINE
"Out of the question, Senator! You and I are too closely aligned. The"
issue will become partisan and debates will begin. The proposal must
come from a neutral source.
MAS AMEDDA
If only Senator Amidala were here.
JAR JAR steps forward from the back of the group.
JAR JAR
"Supreme Chancellor… my august colleagues, I would be proud to"
"propose the motion in question. This is a grave situation, and I’m sure"
"Senator Amidala, and the Queen of Naboo, would agree."
SENATOR ASK AAK
"Thank you, Representative Binks."
Silence. Then PALPATINE sighs deeply.
114 CONTINUED: (3) 114
PALPATINE
"If called upon, I will serve. But it will be the saddest day ofmy life."
"115 EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, HOMESTEAD MOISTURE FARM –"
DAY 115
All is quiet. BERU comes out of the house. She goes to a moisture
line and starts to draw water.
"116 INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, GARAGE – DAY 116"
PADMÉ fixes the last piece of covering onto THREEPIO.
PADMÉ
There!
PADMÉ stands back. OWEN is with her. They look at THREEPIO. He
isn’t the golden figure we know because PADMÉ has had to use
whatever stuff she could find in the garage. He is multi-coloured in
"several textures, but he is complete."
C-3PO
Um. How do I look?
OWEN
Great! You look perfect.
C-3PO
"Perfect? Oh, Miss Padmé, I’m so happy!"
(extending his hand to shake hers)
"Oh, pardon me."
THREEPIO drops his hand and bows formally.
THREEPIO
(continuing)
Thank you.
"He forgets formality and hugs her. PADMÉ hugs him back, laughing."
C-3PO
(continuing)
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
OWEN
(grinning)
"Well, Padmé, I think he should be yours from now on… I know that is"
what my Mom would want.
C-3PO
"Oh, my!"
"Then suddenly, from outside:"
BERU (V.O.)
"Come topside, everybody! He’s back! He’s back."
"117 EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, HOMESTEAD MOISTURE FARM –"
DAY 117
PADMÉ and OWEN run out onto the cbaut to join BERU. THREEPIO
follows. CLIEGG hobbles out of the homestead on his speeder chair.
"They stand looking out into the desert, where ANAKIN rides the"
speeder bike toward the homestead. SHMI’S BODY is tied to it.
"ANAKIN arrives. They run to him as he steps away from the bike,"
"carrying SHM1. He stops, face-to-face with CLIEGG. There is a brief"
pause. Then he carries SHMI into the homestead.
"118 INT TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, GARAGE – DAY 118"
PADMÉ comes in with a tray of food. ANAKIN is kneeling by the
"speeder bike, using an electronic wrench to work on it."
ANAKIN
The shifter broke. Life seems so much simpler when you’re fixing
things.
PADMÉ puts the tray down
ANAKIN
(continuing)
I’m good at fixing things… always was. But I couldn’t…
"(stops working, tears"
in his eyes)
Why did she have to die? Why couldn’t I save her? I know I could
have!
PADMÉ
"Sometimes there are things no one can fix. You’re not all-powerful,"
Annie.
ANAKIN starts working with the wrench again.
ANAKIN
(angry)
I should be! Someday I will be… I will be the most powerful Jedi ever!
"I promise you, I will even learn to stop people from dying."
PADMÉ
Anakin…
ANAKIN
(furious)
It’s all Obi-Wan’s fault. He’s jealous! He knows I’m already more
powerful than he is. He’s holding me back!
ANAKIN hurls the wrench across the garage. It CLATTERS to the
"floor. He looks at his trembling hands. PADMÉ stares at him,"
shocked.
PADMÉ
"Annie, what’s wrong?"
ANAKIN
"I… I killed them. I killed them all. They’re dead, every single one of"
them…
ANAKIN focuses on her like someone returning from far away.
ANAKIN
(continuing)
"Not just the men… the women and children too. They’re like animals,"
and I slaughtered them like animals… I hate them!
118 CONTINUED: 118
"There is silence for a moment, then ANAKIN breaks down, sobbing."
PADMÉ takes him into her arms.
ANAKIN
(continuing)
Why do I hate them? I didn’t… I couldn’t… I couldn’t control myself.
I… I don’t want to hate them… but I just can’t forgive them.
PADMÉ
To be angry is to be human.
ANAKIN
To control your anger is to be a Jedi.
PADMÉ
Ssshhh… you’re human.
ANAKIN
"No. I’m a Jedi. I know I’m better than this. I’m sorry, I’m so sorry!"
PADMÉ
You’re like everyone else…
"PADMÉ rocks him, and ANAKIN weeps."
"119 EXT. GEONOSIS, TOWER ENTRANCE – DAWN 119"
Light grows on the clustering tower of fantastic stalagmites. OBI-WAN
sneaks up to the main one. He climbs up the side of the tower to a
"small window-like opening. OBI-WAN looks around quickly, then"
sneaks inside.
"120 INT. GEONOSIS, CORRIDORS – MORNING 120"
"OBI-WAN makes his way along a narrow, pillared corridor. He comes"
to what looks like a large open well or vent shaft. He looks down and
"sees a huge underground facility below. In one area, machines are"
"constructing BATTLE DROIDS. In another area, completed DROIDS"
"are moving along a conveyor belt. GEONOSIS WORKERS, with no"
"wings, drone away at the assembly line."
"221 INT. GEONOSIS, CENTRAL SQUARE – MORNING 121"
OBI-WAN arrives at a vast expanse in the stalagmite interior.
"Immense pillars, soaring Gaudi-Gothic arches, vaulted roofs. The"
huge space is deserted – completely silent.
OBI-WAN starts to cross the square. Suddenly he hears voices.
He darts behind a pillar as POGGLE THE LESSER (Archduke of
"Geonosis), his aid, SUN RIT, COUNT DOOKU, and NUTE GUNRAY"
"approach, closely followed by PASSEL ARGENTE and WAT"
"TAMBOR. COUNT DOOKU is tall, elderly, and saturnine, with"
beautiful
121 CONTINUED: 121
manners. OBI-WAN flattens himself against the pillar as they pass
by.
POGGLE
"We’re already running at maximum capacity. In less than two months,"
"Viceroy, you’ll have the finest army in the galaxy."
NUTE GUNRAY
"Our early testing of your prototype units has been satisfying, but"
these new Battle Droids are a little less precise than I had hoped.
POGGLE
I’m sure their advanced features will more than make up for that.
COUNT DOOKU
"Now, we must persuade the Commerce Guild and the Corporate"
"Alliance to sign the treaty, then nothing in the universe will be able to"
stop us.
NUTE GUNRAY
What about the Senator from Naboo? Is she dead yet? I’m not
signing your treaty until I have her head on my desk.
COUNT DOOKU
"She will be soon, Viceroy. I am a man of my word, and I have faith in"
this bounty hunter’s abilities.
They move out of earshot. OBI-WAN peers around the pillar to see
them going through an archway on the far side of the courtyard.
There is a flight of stairs beside it.
"OBI-WAN arrives at the stairs. He sneaks up them, to arrive at a"
narrow gothic archway. He looks down through it.
"122 INT. GEONOSIS, CONFERENCE ROOM – DAY 122"
"POGGLE THE LESSER, and his TWO AIDES are at one end of a"
large’ round conference table.
COUNT DOOKU
"Now is the time, my friends. The moment when you have to decide"
between the Republic or the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
COUNT DOOKU is at the head of the table. JANGO FETT stands
behind his chair.
"In addition to the original group, there are also THREE OPPOSITION"
"SENATORS, PO NUDO, TESSEK and TOONBUCK TOORA, and a"
"COMMERCE GUILD DIGNITARY, SHU MAI and a MEMBER of the"
"INTERGALACTIC BANK CLAN, SAN HILL."
122 CONTINUED: 122
COUNT DOOKU
(continuing)
"A hundred more systems will rally to our cause with your support,"
gentlemen. And let me remind you of our absolute commitment to
"capitalism… of the lower taxes, the reduced tariffs, and the eventual"
abolition of all trade barriers. Signing this treaty will bring you profits
beyond your wildest imagination.
(looks at Nute)
Our friends in the Trade Federation have pledged their support.
"When their droid battalions are combined with yours, we shall have"
an army greater than anything in the galaxy. The Jedi will be
overwhelmed. The Republic will agree to any demands we make
"MSEL ARGENTE, THE CORPORATE ALLIANCE"
"REPRESENTATIVE, stands."
PASSEL ARGENTE
I am authorized by the Corporate Alliance to sign the treaty.
COUNT DOOKU
"We are most grateful for your cooperation, Chairman."
"SHU MAI, the Commerce Guild Representative, stands."
SHU MAI
The Commerce Guilds do not at this time wish to become openly
involved. But we shall support you in secret – and look forward to
doing business with you.
There are chuckles around the table. COUNT DOOKU smiles.
COUNT DOOKU
That is all we ask.
"SAN HILL, the banker, stands."
SAN HILL
"The Intergalactic Banking Clan will support you wholeheartedly, but"
only in a non-exclusive arrangement
"123 INT. GEONOSIS, STAIRS – DAY 123"
OBI-WAN pulls back from the archway.
"124 EXT. GEONOSIS, LANDING AREA – DAY 124"
The canopy of Obi-Wan’s Starship is covered with SMALL
CRAWLING CREATURES. The ARFOUR DROID WHIMPERS as
the CREATURES back the little DROID against a rock wall.
125 INT. GEONOSIS# STAIRS AND WINDOW – DAY 125
OBI-WAN hears the DROID WHIMPER through his comlink. He
"starts up the stairs, coming to an outside window. OBI-WAN takes out"
his binoculars as he talk into his camlink.
OBI-WAN
"Arfour, Arfour… Where are you?!?"
"THROUGH THE BINOCULARS, OBI-WAN sees the DROID being"
"chased off by the CRAWLING CREATURES, (ROGAS). He puts the"
binoculars away and climbs the stairs.
"126 EXT. GEONOSIS, TOP OF STALAGMITE – DAY 126"
OBI-WAN arrives at the top of the stalagmite. The view is staggering.
He pulls a length of wire from his utility belt and attaches it to a small
chrome ball that takes the wire high into the air. He clips a little
booster device to the wire. A SHADOW passes over him. He doesn’t
notice.
OBI-WAN
(into comlink)
Artoo Detoo… Artoo Detoo. Do you copy? This is Obi-Wan Kenobi.
Switch to low band.
OBI-WAN listens for a moment then hears a little BEEP.
"127 INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARFIGHTER. – DAY 127"
"In the ship, ARTOO BEEPS as he receives the message."
OBI-WAN (V.0.)
"Record this message and take it to your mistress, Padmé… and the"
"Jedi Skywalker… “Anakin, my long range transmitter is knocked out."
Retransmit this message to Coruscant.”
"128 EXT. GEONOSIS, TOP OF STALAGMITE – DAY 128"
"OBI-WAN talks into his comlink. More SHADOWS pass over him,"
lower now. He doesn’t notice
OBI-WAN
… the Trade Federation is behind the assassination attempts on
Senator Amidala.
The SHAIDOWS are lower.
128 CONTINUED: 128
OBI-WAN
(continuing)
The Commerce Guilds and the Corporate Alliance have pledged their
armies to Count Dooku and are forming an… Wait!
A SHADOW passes very low. OBI-WAN looks up quickly.
"129 INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARFIGHTER – DAY 129"
ARTOO dutifully listens to the desperate meseage.
OBI-WAN (V.0.)
…attack…! don’t… make it… too many… aaaggghhh!
Obi-Wan’s voice cuts out. ARTOO WHISTLES in dismay.
"130 EXT. TATOOINE,, BLUFF OVERLOOKING HOMESTRAD –"
DAY 130
The ramp lowers. ARTOO rolls down and trundles off toward the
bomestead.
"131 EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, GRAVESITE – DAY 131"
"ANAKIN, PADMÉ, CLIEGG, OWEN, BERU, and THREEPIO are"
standinq around Shmi’s grave.
CLIEGG
I know wherever you are it’s become a better place. You were the
"most loving partner a man could ever have. Goodbye, my dearest"
wife. And thank you.
Brief pause.
ANAKIN
"I wasn’t strong enough to save you, Mom. But I promise I won’t fail"
again… I miss you so much.
Silence. Then BEEPS and WHISTLES are heard. They turn as
ARTOO rolls up.
PADMÉ
"Artoo, what are you doing here?"
ARTOO BEEPS and WHISTLES.
C-3PO
It seems he carrying a message from someone called Obi-Wan
"Kenobi. Does that mean anything to you, Master Anakin?"
"132 INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, GARAGE – DAY 132"
A rough hologram of OBI-WAN is projected onto the garage by
"ARTOO. ANAKIN, PADMÉ and THREEPIO watch the flickering"
image.
OBI-WAN
…Alliance have pledged their armies to Count Dooku and are forming
an… Wait!… ah… attack… I don’t… make it… aaaggghhh!
"The hologram cuts off. ANAKIN jumps up, agitated."
ANAKIN
I’m going after him!
PADMÉ
I thought the first thing he said was to retransmit his message to
Coruscant.
ANAKIN
"Yeah, you’re right, you’re right."
"133 EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, MOISTURE FARM – LATE"
DAY 133
"ANAKIN, PADMÉ, ARTOO and THREEPIO leave the homestead,"
"waving to CLIEGG, OWEN and BERU as they go into the desert."
"134 INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP – SUNSET 134"
ANAKIN sits down in the cockpit with PADMÉ. THREEPIO is behind
them. ARTOO is beside him. They are watching a hologram of MACE
WINDU.
MACE WINDU
"We will deal with Count Dooku. The most important thing for you,"
"Anakin, is to stay where you are. Protect the Senator at all costs."
That is your priority.
ANAKIN
"Understood, Master."
The hologram switches off. PADMÉ is looking at the readout on the
ship’s control panel.
PADMÉ
They’ll never get there in time to save him. They have to come half
"way across the galaxy. Look, Geonosis is less than a parsec away."
PADMÉ starts to hit buttons and flick switches. ANAKIN puts a hand
"over hers, stopping her. She stares at him."
ANAKIN
If he’s still alive.
134 CONTINUED: 134
PADMÉ
"Annie, are you just going to sit here and let him die?? He’s your"
friend… your mentor…
ANAKIN
"…He’s like my father, but you heard Master Windu. He gave me strict"
orders to stay here.
PADMÉ
He gave you strict orders to protect me…
PADMÉ pulls her hand free and flicks more switches. The engines
fire.
PADMÉ
(continuing)
"…and I’m going to save Obi-Wan. So if you plan to protect me, you"
will have to come along.
ANAKIN grins and takes the controls.
"135 EXT. TATOOINE, BLUFF OVERLOOKING HOMESTEAD –"
SUNSET 135
The Naboo Starship rises from the bluff and zooms away.
"136 EXT. CORUSCANT, JEDI TEMPLE – DAY 136"
TWO HUNDRED JEDI KNIGHTS are assembling outside the huge
center of the Jedi Order.
"137 INT. CORUSCANT, JEDI TEMPLE, COUNCIL CHAMBER –"
DAY 137
The JEDI COUNCIL are assembled as MACE WINDU makes his
plea.
MACE WINDU
"The longer we wait, the stronger Dooku’s armies become. We cannot"
wait for the Senate to make up its mind about granting the Chancellor
"emergency powers, in order to be able to use that clone army… We"
have the authority to go now. We must go now.
All of the JEDI COUNCIL nod their approval.
YODA
"Agreed, Master Windu. Two hundred Jedi send. Enough, let’s hope"
they are.
"138 INT. CORUSCANT, MAIN SENATE CHAMBER – DAY 138"
"Inside the great rotunda, the UPROAR is even louder. Opposing"
SENATORS yell furiously at one another.
138 CONTINUED 138
MAS AMEDDA
Order! Order!!
"Finally, the uproar dies."
PALPATINE
"In the regrettable absence of Senator Amidala, the chair recognises"
"the Senior Representative of Naboo, Jar Jar Binks."
"Amid the conflicting storm of CHEERS AND BOOS, JAR JAR, with"
"TWO GUNGAN AIDES, floats on his pod to the middle of the vast"
space. He looks at PALPATINE nervously. PALPATINE nods. JAR
JAR clears his throat.
JAR JAR
"Senators, dellow felagates…"
Laughter. Jeers. JAR JAR blushes.
MAS AMEDDA
Order! The Senate will accord the Representative the courtesy of a
hearing!
Comparative quiet. JAR JAR grips the edge of the podium.
JAR JAR
In response to the direct threat to the Republic from the Confederacy
"of Independent Systems, I propose that the Senate gives immediate"
emergency powers to the Supreme Chancellor.
Uproar. JAR JAR looks a little sheepish.
JAR JAR
(continuing)
Who can deny these are exceptional times? Exceptional times
demand exceptional measures! Exceptional measures demand
exceptional men!
ORN FREE TAA
We won’t support a dictator.
SHOUTS of agreement.
JAR JAR
That is the sentiment every one of us agrees with! And when the
shadow of war has dispersed and the bright day of liberty has
"dawned once again, the power we now give to the Supreme"
"Chancellor will be gladly, and swiftly returned. Our ancient liberties"
"will be restored to us, burnished even more brightly than before!"
138 CONTINUED: (2) 138
"Brief silence, then a rolling wave of APPLAUSE. JAR JAR beams and"
bows.
PALPATINE rises.
PALPATINE
It is with great reluctance that I have agreed to this calling. I love
democracy… I love the Republic. The fact that this crisis is
demanding I be given absolute power to rule over you is evident. But
I am mild by nature and have no desire to destroy the democratic
process. The power you give me I will lay down when this crisis has
"abated, I promise you. And all I ask in return is when my current term"
"of office is over, you allow me to reture and live out my life in peace."
MAS AMEDDA
We shall proceed to the vote. All those in favor of granting emergency
"powers to the Supreme Chancellor, signal aye at this time… those"
opposed?
139 EXT. SPACE 139
The Naboo Starship heads toward the rings of Geonosis.
"140 EXT. GEONOSIS, LANDING AREA 140"
The Naboo Starship lands.
"141 INT. COCKPIT, NAOO STARFIGHTER – DAY 141"
ANAKIN switches off the engines. ARTOO and THREEPIO are in the
navigation area of the cockpit. PADMÉ is in the co-pilot’s seat. She
gets up.
ANAKIN
"Hey, where are you going?"
PADMÉ
To find Obi-Wan.
ANAKIN gets up and goes over to her.
ANAKIN
No! You’re not!
He grabs her arm.
PADMÉ
Let go of me!
141 CONTINUED: 141
ANAKIN
I’m not letting you go out there. It’s too dangerous.
PADMÉ
What?!?
ANAKIN
"It’s my job to protect you. I said it’s too dangerous. You’re not going,"
and that’s final!
PADMÉ
"Don’t you give me orders, Annie! I’m a Senator of the Galactica"
"Republica. You have no authority to contain me, restrain me, or direct"
"me! You remember your place, young man."
(standing up)
Now you can come along and protect me or stay here. It’s up to you.
PADMÉ storms out of the cockpit of the Naboo Starfighter. ANAKIN
"stands scratching his head, then follows."
ARTOO BEEPS and WHISTLES.
C-3PO
"Yes, it is, Artoo. Most confusing. One moment they’re generating a"
"pleasant mutual attraction and the next, waves of violent hostility."
"Even though I’m programmed to understand them, I doubt if I ever"
shall.
ARTOO WHISTLES a plaintive sigh.
"142 INT. GEONOSIS, CORRIDORS – DAY 142"
"ANAKIN and PADMÉ enter the stalagmite city. They stop, looking"
around in wonder at the emptiness.
PADMÉ
(in a low voice)
It’s empty!
"They start forward. As they pass, the surface of the pillars seems to"
pulse slowly and move. High above WINGED CREATURES grow
from the pillars and detach themselves.
"143 INT. GEONOSIS, CENTRAL SQUARE – DAY 143"
"ANAKIN and PADMÉ cross the square, reaching the middle. They"
stop suddenly as FOUR GEONOSIANS grabs them. ANAKIN
reaches for his lightsaber.
PADMÉ
Wait!
143 CONTINUED: 143
TWENTY WINGED GEONOSIANS carrying weapons alight on the
flagstones in front of them.
"The GEONOSIANS part, and COUNT DOOKU appears. He bows"
courteously.
COUNT DOOKU
"Senator Amidala, I’ve heard so much about you."
PADMÉ
"Count Dooku, I assume."
COUNT DOOKU
"I’m delighted to meet you at last. We have a great deal to discuss,"
Senator. I hope you can keep your young Jedi under control.
PADMÉ
Don’t worry he’s housebroken.
144 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM (GEONOSIS) – DAY 144
COUNT DOOKU sits at a large conference table with PADMÉ on the
far side. ANAKIN stands behind her with FOUR GEONOSIANS
GUARDS standing behind him. JANGO FETT stands behind COUNT
"DOOKU, and SIX GEONOSIAN GUARDS stand behind him."
PADMÉ
"You are holding a Jedi Knight, Obi-Wan Kenobi. I am formally"
"requesting you turn him over to me, now."
COUNT DOOKU
"He has been convicted of espionage, Senator, and will be executed."
"In just a few hours, I believe."
COUNT DOOKU smiles.
PADMÉ
He is an officer of the Republic. You can’t do that.
COUNT DOOKU
"We don’t recognise the Republic here, Senator. But if Naboo were to"
"join our Alliance, I could easily hear your plea for clemency."
ANAKIN grabs his lightsaber but doesn’t turn it on.
PADMÉ
"And if I don’t join your rebellion, I assume this Jedi with me will also"
die?
144 CONTINUED: 144
COUNT DOOKU
"I don’t wish to make you to join our cause against your will, Senator,"
"but you are a rational, honest representative of your people and I"
assume you want to do what’s in their best interest. Aren’t you fed up
"with the corruption, the bureaucrats, the hypocrisy of it all?.. Aren’t"
"you? Be honest, Senator."
PADMÉ
"The ideals are still alive, Count, even if the institution is failing."
COUNT DOOKU
You believe in the same ideals we believe in! The same ideals we are
striving to make prominent.
PADMÉ
"If what you say is true, you should stay in the Republic and help"
Chancellor Palpatine put things right.
COUNT DOOKU
"The Chancellor means well, M’Lady, but he is incompetent. He has"
"promised to cut the bureaucracy, but the bureaucrats are stronger"
"than ever, no? Senator, the Republic cannot be fixed. It is time to"
"start over. The democratic process in the Republic is a sham, a shell"
"game played on the voters. It will not be long before the cult of greed,"
"called the Republic, will lose even the pretext of democracy and"
freedom.
PADMÉ
I cannot believe that. I will not forsake all I have honoured and
worked for and betray the Republic. I know of your treaties with the
"Trade Federation, the Commerce Guilds, and the others, Count."
What is happening here is not government that has been bought out
by business… it’s business becoming government!
COUNT DOOKU
Are you willing to betray your Jedi friends? Without your co-operation
I can do nothing to stop their execution.
PADMÉ
What is to happen to me? Am I to be executed also?
144 CONTINUED: (2) 144
DOOKU
"I wouldn’t think of such an offence. But, there are individuals who"
"have a strong interest in your demise, M’Lady. It has nothing to do"
"with politics, I’m afraid. It’s purely personal, and they have already"
paid great sums to have you assassinated. I’m sure they will push
hard to have you included in the executions. I’m sorry but if you are
"not going to co-operate, I must turn you over to the Geonosians for"
justice. I’ve done all I can for you.
JANGO FETT moves over to ANAKIN.
JANGO FETT
I’ll take that weapon.
ANAKIN hesitates.
COUNT DOOKU
"You may cause a lot of bloodshed, my young Jedi, but you will not"
escape.
PADMÉ
Anakin…
ANAKIN hands his lightsaber over to JANGO FETT.
"145 INT. GEONOSIS, HIGH AUDIENCE CHAMBER – DAY 145"
ANAKIN and PADMÉ are standing in the centre of what looks like a
"courtroom. Seated before them in a tall, boxed-off area is POGGLE"
"THE LESSER, Archduke of Geonosis. He is accompanied by his"
"underling, SUN RIT. Off to one side the Separatist Senators PO"
"NUDU, TESSEK, and TOONBUCK TOORA. Next to them are the"
"Commerce Dignitaries, SHU MAI, NUTE GUNRAY, PASSEL"
"ARGENTE, WAT TAMBOR and SAN HILL of the Intergalactic Bank"
Clan. Along the wall about a HUNDRED GEONOSIANS wait for a
verdict.
SUN RIT
You have been charged and found guilty of Espionage.
POGGLE
Do you have anything to say before your sentence is carried out?
PADMÉ
"You are committing an act of war, Archduke. I hope you are prepared"
for the consequences.
POGGLE laughs. COUNT DOOKU simply smiles.
145 CONTINUED: 145
POGGLE
"We build weapons, Senator… that is our business! Of course we’re"
prepared!
NUTE GUNRAY
Get on with it. Carry out the sentence. I want to see her suffer.
POGGLE
"Your other Jedi friend is waiting for you, Senator. Take them to the"
arena!
FOUR GUARDS take hold of PADME and ANAKIN. They are
escorted out of the chamber to the sounds of chuckling.
146 INT. GEONOSIS TUNNEL TO EXECUTION ARENA – DAY 146
"In the gloomy tunnel, ANAKIN and PADME are tossed into an open"
cart. The murmur of a vast crowd is heard offscreen. GUARDS
extend their arms along the framework and tie them so that they
stand facing each other.
The DRIVER gets up onto his seat.
ANAKIN
Don’t be afraid.
PADMÉ
I’m not afraid to die. I’ve been dying a little bit each day since you
came back into my life.
ANAKIN
What are you talking about?
PADMÉ
I love you.
ANAKIN
You love me?! I thought we decided not to fall in love. That we would
be forced to live a lie. That it would destroy our lives…
PADMÉ
I think our lives are about to be destroyed anyway. My love for you is
"a puzzle, Annie, for which I have no answers. I can’t control it… and"
"now I don’t care. I truly, deeply love you, and before we die I want"
you to know.
"PADMÉ leans toward ANAKIN. By straining hard, it is just possible for"
their lips to meet. They kiss.
ANAKIN
"I have no desire to be cured of this love either. Long or short, I vow to"
spend the rest of my life with you.
146 CONTINUED: 146
They kiss again.
The DRIVER cracks his whip over the ORRAY harnessed between
"the shafts. The cart jerks forward. Suddenly, there is a HUGE ROAR"
and blinding sunlight as they emerge into the arena
"147 INT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA – DAY 147"
The great stadium is packed with tier upon tier of yelling
"GEONOSIANS. The cart trundles to the center, where OBI-WAN is"
chained to one of four upright posts that are three feet in diameter.
"The cart stops. PADMÉ and ANAKIN are taken down, dragged to"
"posts, and chained to them. PADMÉ is in the center."
OBI-WAN
I was beginning to wonder if you had gotten my message.
ANAKIN
"I retransmitted it as you requested, Master. Then we decided to come"
and rescue you.
OBI-WAN
It looks like you’re going a good job so far.
"Their arms are pulled high above their heads, and the cart drives"
"away. There is another ROAR as POGGLE THE LESSER, COUNT"
"DOOKU, NUTE GUNRAY, THE FETTS and DIGNITARIES arrive in"
the archducal box and take their places.
SUN RIT
The felons before you have been convicted of espionage against the
Sovereign System of Geonosis. Their sentence of death is to be
carried out in this public arena henceforth.
"The crowd ROARS and CHEERS. In the box, POGGLE THE"
LESSER rises. The crowd becomes quiet.
POGGLE
Let the executions begin!
The crowd goes wild.
ANAKIN
I have a bad feeling about this.
"From different gates around the arena, THREE MONSTERS are"
"driven in. One is a REEK (bull-like), one is a NEXU (lion-like), and"
one is an ACKLAY (a kind of dino-lobster). They are driven in by
PICADORS carrying long spears and riding ORRAYS. The
"PICADORS poke the MONSTERS toward the center, then retire to"
the perimeter.
"The MONSTERS toss their heads, looking around, ROARING or"
SCREECHING. Then they catch sight of the THREE CAPTIVES and
start moving toward them.
OBI-WAN
Take the one the left. I’ll take the one on the right.
ANAKIN
What about Padmé?
PADMÉ has turned around and is pulling herself up by the chain to
"the top of the post. Within a moment, she is standing on top of it,"
trying to pull the chain free.
OBI-WAN
It looks like she’s already on top of things.
"The REEK charges ANAKIN. He jumps up, and the beast hits the"
"post hard. ANAKIN lands onto its back, wrapping part of his chain"
"around its horn. The REEK backs off, shaking its head angrily, which"
tears the chain from the post
OBI-WAN ducks around the post as the ACKLAY charges. It knocks
"the post flat, sending OBI-WAN sprawling. The ACKLAY crunches"
"the post between its claws, freeing the chain. OBI-WAN leaps up and"
runs towards ONE of the PICADORS. The ACKLAY taks off after
him.
The NEXU arrives at PADMÉ’S post and rears on its hind legs. On
"top, PADMÉ struggles to tear the chain free. The NEXU ROARS,"
"displaying wicked, dripping fangs."
"In the archducal box, NUTE GUNRAY beams and rubs his hands."
"In the arena, OBI-WAN runs at the PICADOR. The ORRAY rears up."
OBI-WAN grabs the PICADOR’s long spear and pole vaults over him.
The chasing ACKLAY smashes into the ORRAY. It goes down. The
"PICADOR tumbles onto the sand, where he is grabbed by the"
ACKLAY and crunched.
ANAKIN’s REEK starts to buck. It charges around the arena with
ANAKIN hanging on for dear life. He whirls the free length of chain
around his head and casts it into the REEK’s mouth. Its jaws clamp
"hard on the chain. ANAKIN yanks hard on the chain, turning the"
"REEK, beginning to ride it."
The NEXU’s claws dig deep into the post. The cat-like creature
reaches the top of the post and takes a swipe at PADMÉ. She turns
"and the claw barely catches her shirt ripping it off, leaving superficial"
claw marks across her back. She hits the creature with her chain and
"it backs off down the pole. Then, PADMÉ jumps off the post into the"
air. She swings around on the chain and whacks the beast hard on
the head with both her feet. It tumbles back onto the sand.
In the archducal box:
NUTE GUNRAY
Foul!! She can’t do that… shoot her or something!
"In the arena, OBI-WAN runs out from behind the fallen ORRAY and"
"throws the spear at the ACKLAY, hitting it in the neck. It lets out a"
terrible SCREECH and turns on him. The NEXU springs up and
makes to leap up at PADMÉ again. She finally manages to work the
chain loose. ANAKIN comes charging up on the REEK.
147 CONTINUED: (2) 147
ANAKIN
You okay?
PADMÉ
"(nods, gasping)"
"Sure! Well, sort of."
ANAKIN
Jump!!!
The NEXU springs. PADMÉ leaps from the top of the post to land on
the REEK in front of ANAKIN. He hauls her upright. The REEK
"charges away, around the arena. The NEXU bounds after it. The"
REEK passes the wounded ACKLAY. The NEXU smells the blood
and turns aside to attack the ACKLAY. The TWO MONSTERS fight.
The crowd GROANS and BOOS.
"In the archducal box, NUTE GUNRAY turns angrily to COUNT"
DOOKU.
NUTE GUNRAY
"This isn’t how it’s supposed to be! Jango, finish her off."
COUNT DOOKU motions for the bounty hunter to stay put. BOBA
FETT is enjoying the spectacle.
COUNT DOOKU
(smiling enigmatically)
"Patience, Viceroy… she will die. Maybe this is the way it’s supposed"
to end.
OBI-WAN runs and jumps on the back of the REEK behind ANAKIN.
"Across the arena, the NEXU, having chewed up the ACKLAY, starts"
to advance toward them.
"148 INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP – DAY 148"
ARTOO BEEPS
C-3PO
"Yes, it has been rather a long time. Do you suppose something’s"
happened to them?
ARTOO BEEPS and WHISTLES.
C-3PO
(continuing)
"Danger? Oh no, I shouldn’t think so. It looks a very dull planet to me."
"They should be back shortly. Just stop worrying, Artoo."
"149 EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA – DAY 149"
"In the archducal box, amid the uproar, COUNT DOOKU feels a tap"
on his shoulder. He turns to see MACE WINDU standing behind him.
COUNT DOOKU masks his surprise elegantly as he surveys the
arena and sees JEDI KNIGHTS standing at every entrance and exit.
149 CONTINUED: 149
COUNT DOOKU
"Master Windu, how pleasant of you to join us. You’re just in time for"
the moment of truth. I would think these two new boys of yours could
use a little more training.
MACE WINDU
"Sorry to disappoint you, Dooku. This party’s over."
"MACE WINDU signals, and at stategic places around the arena there"
are sudden flashes of light as about ONE HUNDRED JEDI switch on
their lightsabers. The crowd is suddenly silent. COUNT DOOKU’S
lips curl in slight amusement.
COUNT DOOKU
(to Mace Windu)
"Brave, but stupid, my old Jedi friend. You’re impossibly outnumbered."
MACE WINDU
I don’t think so. One Jedi has to be worth a hundred Geonosians.
COUNT DOOKU looks around the great theater. His smile grows.
COUNT DOOKU
It wasn’t the Geonosians I was thinking about. How well do you think
one Jedi will hold up against a thousand battle droids?
COUNT DOOKU signals. THOUSANDS OF DROIDS start to pour
into all parts of the arena.
"MACE WINDU draws his lightsaber, JANGO FETT draws his guns"
"and fires at MACE WINDU, who deflects the shots. JANGO FETT"
"and MACE WINDU jump into the arena, where they fight. BOBA"
FETT wacthes his Dad and the Jedi Master fight. The battle begins.
"GEONOSIANS fly away everywhere. DROIDS fire at JEDI, who"
deflect the bolts and cut down the DROIDS. The GEONOSIAN
TROOPS fire ray guns that are more difficult for the JEDI to deflect.
The REEK and the NEXU are spooked by the battle. The REEK
"bucks the riders off its back and stampedes around the arena,"
trampling DROIDS and JEDI that have moved into its path. PADMÉ
picks up a discarded pistol and joins the fight. SEVERAL JEDI run to
the center of the arena and toss lightsabers to OBI-WAN and
ANAKIN.
"Among the crowd, JEDI cut down swaths of GEONOSIANS and"
"DROIDS. On the sand, JEDI fight, attacking DROIDS. OBI-WAN and"
"ANAKIN swing their lightsabers, cutting DROIDS in half. PADMÉ"
blasts away at DROIDS and GEONOSIANS.
"150 INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP 150"
ARTOO whistles.
150 CONTINUED: 150
C-3PO
I don’t hear anything.
(Artoo beeps)
You’re scaring me! Stop imagining things!
"151 EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA – DAY 151"
"Among the tiers, JEDI are slowly being driven back. They have killed"
"heaps of GEONOSIANS and have knocked out piles of DROIDS, but"
sheer numbers are telling. Individual JEDI are being cut down or
blasted. The rest are retreating into the arena.
"ANAKIN and PADMÉ are back-to-back, fighting DROIDS and flying"
GEONOSIANS. MACE WINDU fights fiercely with JANGO FETT.
"Finally, the bounty hunter falls. His helmet goes flying, bouncing"
"down the steps, tumbling and rolling, kicked here and there by"
random feet. The bounty hunter’s body falls to the ground.
MACE WINDU runs to the center of the arena and fights back-to-back
"with OBI-WAN, as they swipe and mangle DROIDS."
OBI-WAN
Someone’s got to – shut down – these droids.
MACE WINDU
Don’t worry! It’s being – taken care of!
"152 EXT. GEONOSIS, FEDERATION STARSHIP – DAY 152"
KI-ADI-MUNDI leads a raiding party of about TWENTY JEDI through
the lines of parked Battle Starships. They cut a swath through
masses of DROIDS until they arrive at the Command Starship. Some
JEDI fall. The rest cut their way up the ramps and into the Command
Ship.
"153 INT. COMMAND FEDERATION STARSHIP, CORRIDORS –"
DAY 153
KI-ADI-MUNDI and the surviving JEDI fight their way through the
"corridors of the Command Ship, deflecting laser bolts, slicing"
DROIDS.
"154 INT. COMMAND FEDERATION STARSHIP, CONTROL"
BRIDGE – DAY 154
THEY burst onto the bridge and chop down the COMMAND DROIDS.
The NEIMOIDIANS flee in all directions. KI-ADI-MUNDI leans over
the control panel. He locates the illuminated master switch and
"punches down on it. It goes dark. Instantly, all the DROIDS on the"
Starship and all the DROIDS in the arena FREEZE!
"There is a moment of stunned silence, then the JEDI CHEER. On the"
"bridge, PLO KOON claps KI-ADI-MUNDI on the back."
PLO KOON
We’ve done it! Now we have a chance!
154 CONTINUED: 154
"Suddenly, there is a harsh BEEPING SOUND. All the DROIDS on the"
Starship and all the DROIDS in the arena start fighting again! KI-ADIMUNDI
stares in disbelief and dismay.
KI-ADI-MUNDI
The system’s off but they’re still active. That’s a new feature. They
are independent of the control system.
"155 EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA – DAY 155"
"MACE WINDU, OBI-WAN, ANAKIN, PADMÉ and an exhausted"
group of about TWENTY JEDI stand in the center of the arena
surrounded by a ring of BATTLE DROIDS. The bloodied sand around
"them is strewn with the bodies of DEAD GEONOSIANS,"
SHATTERED DROIDS and JEDI.
"At the foot of some steps, BOBA FETT finds his father’s battered"
helmet. He picks it up.
KI-ADI-MUNDI and the SURVIVORS from the raiding party are
herded into the arena by SUPERDROIDS. From the encircling tiers
"above, THOUSANDS OF BATTLE DROIDS level their weapons"
menacingly.
"In the archducal box, COUNT DOOKU lifts his hand. The DROIDS"
lower their weapons. The COUNT calls out to the JEDI.
COUNT DOOKU
Master Windu!
Silence.
COUNT DOOKU
(continuing)
You have fought gallantly. Worthy of recognition in the history
archives of the Jedi Order. Now it is finished.
(pauses briefly)
Surrender – and your lives will be spared.
MACE WINDU
"We will not be hostages for you to barter with, Dooku."
COUNT DOOKU
"Then, I’m sorry, old friend. You will have to be destroyed."
The DROIDS raise their weapons. ANAKIN and PADMÉ clasps
hands tightly. COUNT DOOKU raises his hand to give the order to
fire. PADMÉ looks up suddenly and whispers to ANAKIN.
PADMÉ
Look!
"Above, six Gunships are descending fast through the open area in"
the arena ceiling. They land in a cluster around the handful of JEDI.
CLONE TROOPERS spill out and start firing at the DROIDS. There is
a hellstorm of laserfire that bounces off the laser shields created by
the Gunships. YODA appears at the door of one of the Gunships.
155 CONTINUED: 155
YODA
Come on – hurry! Hurry!
The SURVIVING JEDI dash to the Gunships and scramble in. MACE
"WINDU hangs on tight as the Gunship, firing all its weapons, rises out"
of the arena up and over the topmost rim.
"156 EXT. GEONOSIS, TERRAIN OUTSIDE EXECUTION ARENA –"
DAY 156
The massed lines of parked Federation Starships and the DROIDS
"surrounding the arena, are themselves surrounded by thousands of"
"Republic Starships, disgorging TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CLONE"
"TROOPERS. Beyond, more Republic Starships are landing and"
spewing out troops.
157 INT. GUNSHIP NUMBER ONE – DAY 157
MACE WINDU stares at the incredible sight.
YODA
"More battalions to the left. Encircle them we must, then divide."
The CLONE TROOPERS open fire with artillery. EXPLOSIONS
"wreck the parked Battle Starships. CLONE TROOPERS advance,"
"firing at the massed DROIDS. FIGHTER DROIDS fly overhead,"
exchanging fire with the Gunships and JEDI fighters.
"158 INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP – DAY 158"

"I’m sure I heard something, this time. Didn’t you? It’s probably just a"
celebration
ARTOO lets out an EXHAUSTED BLEEP.
"159 EXT. BATTLEFIELD, GEONOSIS LANDSCAPE – DAY 159"
"Gunship #2 skims the battlefield, firing down, deflecting answering"
fire from the droids.
160 INT. GUNSHIP NUMBER TWO – DAY 160
"OBI-WAN, ANAKIN and PADMÉ are at the open sides of the"
Gunship. CLONES fire down at the DROIDS below.
"The Gunship slows, circling over a droid gun-emplacement. It blasts"
"it, but suddenly the Gunship is rocked by a near miss. It lurches"
violently.
OBI-WAN
Hold on! Look over there…
160 CONTINUED: 160
"Through the other side of the Gunship, they see a Geonosian"
Speeder racing past. In the open cockpit is the unmistakable figure of
COUNT DOOKU.
ANAKIN
"It’s Dooku, go after him!"
"The PILOT starts to comply, but… there is a HUGE BLASTS, the ship"
"lurches on its side, and PADMÉ tumbles out."
ANAKIN
(continuing)
Padmé!!!
ANAKIN stares down in horror as PADMÉ hits thr ground below.
ANAKIN
(continuing; to pilot)
Put the ship down! Down!
OBI-WAN
No! Forget her. We have to go after Dooku.
ANAKIN
No we’re not!! Land this ship!
OBI-WAN
Don’t let your personal feelings get in the way. We’ve got a job to do.
"Below, PADMÉ hauls herself to her feet and waves for them to go"
after DOOKU.
ANAKIN
I don’t care!.. Go back.
OBI-WAN
Anakin! She’s all right! Look.
ANAKIN stares out to see PADMÉ rescued by CLONE TROOPERS.
OBI-WAN
(continuing)
Follow that speeder!
"On the ground, PADMÉ looks up at Gunship #2 as it speeds away"
after Count Dooku. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN follow the speeder to a
Geonosian tower. The speeder descends rapidly; the Gunship
follows.
Count Dooku’s speeder parks outside the tower; the Gunship parks
next to it. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN leap down and run inside the tower.
"161 INT. GEONOSIS, SECRET HANGER TOWER – LATE DAY 161"
COUNT DOOKU throws switches on a control panel. His Interstellar
Sail Ship is guarded by a SQUAD OF SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. The
doors of the exit-port slide open.
DROID CAPTAIN
Your Excellency!
161 CONTINUED: 161
COUNT DOOKU turns as OBI-WAN and ANAKIN run in through the
hanger doors. They draw their lightsabers. The DROIDS raise their
weapons.
COUNT DOOKU
"That won’t be necessary, Captain. Stand down. And leave them to"
me.
The DROIDS lower their weapons and back off to the walls. COUNT
DOOKU looks at OBI-WAN and ANAKIN with slight amusement.
OBI-WAN
(to Anakin)
We move in together – you slowly on the…
ANAKIN
I’m taking him now!
OBI-WAN
"Anakin, no!"
ANAKIN
"You’ll pay for all the Jedi you’ve killed today, Dooku."
"ANAKIN charges across the open space at COUNT DOOKU, who"
"smiles faintly, watching him come. ANAKIN raises his lightsaber. At"
"the last moment, COUNT DOOKU thrusts out an arm, and ANAKIN is"
"lifted up, hurled across the room, and slammed into the opposite wall."
"He slumps to the foot of the wall, semi-conscious. COUNT DOOKU"
moves toward OBI-WAN.
COUNT DOOKU
"Kenobi, isn’t it? As you can see, my Jedi powers are far beyond"
"yours. Now, back down."
OBI-WAN
I don’t think so.
OBI-WAN lifts his lightsaber. COUNT DOOKU smiles.
COUNT DOOKU
"Ah, but if I must."
COUNT DOOKU draws his lightsaber. He and OBI-WAN start to
circle each other.
COUNT DOOKU
(continuing)
I have spent the last ten years learning to use the power of the Dark
Side. It gives me infinitely greater power.
OBI-WAN
You will have to prove it.
"OBI-WAN comes in fast, swinging at COUNT DOOKU’S head."
"DOOKU parries the cut easily. As they fight, it quickly becomes clear"
"that DOOKU is the complete swordsman – elegant, graceful, classical"
– a master of the old style.
161 CONTINUED: 161
COUNT DOOKU
"Grand Master Kenobi, you disappoint me. Yoda holds you in such"
high esteem.
COUNT DOOKU parried another cut.
COUNT DOOKU
(continuing)
Surely you can do better…?
(parries)
"No, I’m surprised. Has Jedi swordsmanship degenerated so quickly,"
or are you trying to make fun of me?
(cuts)
Which is it?
"COUNT DOOKU thrusts. OBI-WAN steps back quickly, panting for"
breath.
COUNT DOOKU
(continuing)
"Come, come, Master Kenobi. Put me out of my misery."
"OBI-WAN takes a deep breath, gets a fresh grip on his lightsaber and"
"comes in again. For a moment, he drives COUNT DOOKU back."
"Then Dooku’s superior skill begins to tell again, and he forces OBIWAN"
to retreat.
COUNT DOOKU increases the tempo of his attack. OBI-WAN is
pushed to the limit to defend himself. DOOKU presses. His lightsaber
flashes.
"OBI-WAN is wounded in the shoulder, then the thigh. He stumbles"
"back against the wall, trips, and falls. His lightsaber goes skittering"
across the floor.
COUNT DOOKU raises his lightsaber. OBI-WAN looks up helplessly.
Dooku’s lightsaber flashes down and CLASHES against – Anakin’s
lightsaber! COUNT DOOKU and ANAKIN stare eyeball to eyeball.
COUNT DOOKU
(continuing)
"That’s brave of you, boy – but foolish. I would have thought you’d"
have learnt your lesson.
ANAKIN
I’m a slow learner.
And ANAKIN charges at COUNT DOOKU. The force of his attack
catches the Count slightly off balance. Anakin’s lightsaber flashes.
"COUNT DOOKU draws back, putting a hand to his arm. He takes the"
hand away and looks at the smear of blood where Anakin has nicked
him.
COUNT DOOKU
"You have unusual powers, young Padawan. But not enough to save"
you this time.
161 CONTINUED: (2) 161
ANAKIN
Don’t bet on it!
OBI-WAN
Anakin!
OBI-WAN uses the Force to catch his lightsaber and he tosses it to
"ANAKIN. With TWO LIGHTSABERS, ANAKIN attacks. COUNT"
DOOKU parries and ripostes. It’s no contest. ANAKIN is driven back
"against the wall. He loses one lightsaber. Finally COUNT DOOKU, in"
"one flashing move, sends Anakin’s arm, cut at the elbow, flying still"
gripping his lightsaber. ANAKIN drops to the ground in agony.
COUNT DOOKU draws himself up to deliver the coup de grace.
"Suddenly, the great doors slide open. The DROIDS turn fast, raising"
"their weapons. Through the thick smoke, emerges the heroic figure of"
"YODA. He stops on the smoke-filled threashold, FOUR DROIDS"
"lined up on either side of him, guns pointed."
"Before the DROIDS can get off a shot, YODA raises his hand, and"
the DROIDS are flung against the far walls and crash to the floor in
heaps of smoking metal.
Silence. COUNT DOOKU steps away from ANAKIN to face the Jedi
Grand Master. His lightsaber whirls in a formal salute.
COUNT DOOKU
Master Yoda. At last we shall know who is the most powerful.
YODA draws a miniature lightsaber out of his cane. He salutes
formally.
YODA
"Count Dooku. No interest in contests, do I have."
COUNT DOOKU charges across the space at YODA. He rains down
blows upon the tiny figure. YODA doesn’t budge an inch. For the first
"part of the contest, he parries every cut and thrust that Dooku aims."
Nothing the great swordsman tries gets through. His energy drains.
"His strokes become feebler, slower."
YODA attacks! He flies forward. COUNT DOOKU is forced to retreat.
Words are insufficient to describe the range and skill of Yoda’s speed
and swordplay. His lightsaber is a humming blur of light.
Count Dooku’s lightsaber is sent cartwheeling from his hand. He
"staggers back, gasping and spent, against the control panel. YODA"
"jumps onto DOOKU’S shoulders, and is about to drive the lightsaber"
into the top of the Count’s head.
YODA
(continuing)
"The end for you, Count, this is."
COUNT DOOKU
…Not yet…
COUNT DOOKU raises his arms and knocks YODA off his shoulders
"and then, with all his might, he uses the Force to pull on one of the"
cranes in the hanger. It comes crashing down on OBI-WAN and
"ANAKIN. But in the blink of and eye, YODA is under the crane,"
"holding it up, using the Force. YODA closes his eyes and"
concentrates.
161 CONTINUED 161
"ANAKIN is unconscious, and OBI-WAN tries to get out from under the"
"crane. The fallen crane trembles and starts to life. Behind it, the"
sound of the Sail Ship’s engines are heard starting up.
"YODA concentrates harder. Slowly, the crane rises. The SOUND OF"
THE ENGINES increases. YODA exerts every scrap of his powers.
The crane lifts clear of ANAKIN and is thrown to the ground.
DOOKU’S Sail Ship takes off. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN struggle to the
"exhausted YODA, but it’s too late. The Sail Ship rises into the air and"
flies away. PADMÉ and a CLONE CAPTAIN with about TEN
TROOPERS appear in the doorway.
PADMÉ
Anakin!
PADMÉ runs too him and throws her arms around him. ANAKIN is
"barely able to stand up. The CLONE CAPTAIN marches up to YODA,"
"stops, and salutes smartly."
CLONE CAPTAIN
"Resistance is at an end, General. What are your orders?"
YODA looks at him and sighs.
"162 EXT. CORUSCANT, OLD TOWN – DAWN 162"
"COUNT DOOKU’S Interstellar Sail Ship glides through a deserted,"
burned-out part of Coruscant. COUNT DOOKU maneuvers the ship
into one of the empty buildings and lands.
"163 INT. CORUSCANT, SECRET LANDING PLATFORM –"
DAWN 163
The ramp lowers. COUNT DOOKU emerges and walks to where the
hooded figure of DARTH SIDIOUS stands waiting. COUNT DOOKU
bows.
COUNT DOOKU
"The Force is with us, my Master."
DARTH SIDIOUS
"Welcome home, Lord Tyranus. You have done well."
COUNT DOOKU
"I bring you good news, my Lord. The war has begun."
DARTH SIDIOUS
Excellent.
(smiling)
Everything is going as planned.
"164 EXT. CORUSCANT, JEDI TEMPLE – SUNSET 164"
The beautiful temple basks in the red glow of the setting sun.
"165 INT. JEDI TEMPLE, COUNCIL CHAMBER – SUNSET 165"
MACE WINDU
Where is your apprentice?
OBI-WAN
On his way back to Naboo. He is escorting Senator Amidala home.
"They are standing, looking out through the tall windows at the great"
plaza below. YODA sits in his chair.
OBI-WAN
(continuing)
"I must admit without the clones, it would not have been a victory."
YODA
"Victory? Victory, you say?"
OBI-WAN turns and looks at the sad little Jedi sitting in the Council
"Chamber. Apart from KI-ADI-MUNDI and PLO KOON, who is"
"wounded, the Chamber is empty."
YODA
(continuing)
"Not victory, a defeat, it was… Master Obi-Wan. Begun, the Clone"
War has!
"166 EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, GARDEN – LATE"
DAY 166
"In a rose-covered arbor overlooking the sparkling lake, ANAKIN and"
PADMÉ stand before a NABOO HOLY MAN.
"THREEPIO and ARTOO stand by, watching, as the HOLY MAN"
"blesses the happy couple and, amid gently falling rose petals,"
ANAKIN and PADME kiss.
"167 EXT. CORUSCANT, MILITARY STAGING AREA, BALCONY –"
LATE DAY 167
"PALPATINE, JAR JAR, BAIL ORGANA and the OTHER"
"SENATORS, with TWO ROYAL GUARDS, stand looking down at the"
square below.
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CLONE TROOPS are drawn up in a
strict formation or move forwards in near files to climb the ramps of
the Military Assault Ships.
"On the balcony, PALPATINE’s expression is deeply sad. Everyone"
"watches somberly as, in the square, loaded Assault Ships take off."
Other land immediately in their place. The sky above is thick with
transports. CLONE TROOPS march and board the Ships.
The Great Clone War has begun…
FADE OUT
"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away…"
"A vast sea of stars serves as a backdrop for the Main Title, followed"
"by a rollup, which crawls into infinity."
War! The Republic is crumbling under attacks by the ruthless Sith
"Lord, Count Dooku. There are heroes on both sides. Evil is"
everywhere.
"In a stunning move, the fiendish droid leader, General Grievous, has"
"swept into the Republic capital and kidnapped Chancellor Palpatine,"
leader of the Republic.
As the Separatist Droid Army attempts to flee the besieged capital
"with their valuable hostage, two Jedi Knights lead a desperate"
mission to rescue the captive Chancellor…
PAN DOWN to reveal a REPUBLIC ATTACK CRUISER. Continue to
PAN with the Cruiser as TWO JEDI STARFIGHTERS enter and head
toward an enemy Battle Cruiser. TRUCK with the Jedi Fighers as
"theu maneuver in unison, dodging flack and enemy laser fire. R2-D2"
is on Anakin’s ship. R4-P17 is on Obi-Wan’s ship. A giant space
battle is revealed as the tiny Jedi ships continue their assault in a
synchronous ballet.
2 INT. OBI-WAN’S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT – SPACE 2
OBI-WAN bounces through the flack with a frown. His ship rocks
violently.
3 INT. ANAKIN’S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT – SPACE 3
ANAKIN smiles as he blasts a TRADE FEDERATION DROID DROP
FIGHTER.
ANAKIN
"There isn’t a droid made that can out fly you, Master, and no other"
way to get to the Chancellor…
OBI-WAN
"Look out, four droids inbound…"
4 EXT. CORUSCANT – SPACE BATTLE 4
The TWO JEDI FIGHTERS swerve in unison as FOUR TRADE
FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTERS attack. After several clever
"moves by the Jedi, two of the FEDERATION DROID DROP"
FIGHTERS collide with each other in a ball of flame.
5 INT. OBI-WAN’S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT – SPACE 5
OBI-WAN struggles to maintain control of his ship.
OBI-WAN
We’ve got to split them up.
ANAKIN
"Break left, fly through the guns on that tower."
OBI-WAN flies to the left of a huge tower on a REPUBLIC CRUISER.
The TWO DROID DROP FIGHTERS follow.
OBI-WAN
Easy for you to say… why am I always the bait?
ANAKIN
"Don’t worry, I’m coming around behind you."
"OBI-WAN deftly maneuvers around a large Starship’s superstructure,"
"but the TWO DROID FIGHTERS stay on his tail, BLASTING him with"
intense laser fire.
OBI-WAN
"Anakin, they’re all over me!"
ANAKIN
"Dead ahead! Closing… lock onto him, Artoo…"
ARTOO BEEPS his reply as ANAKIN swoops in for the kill. ANAKIN
BLASTS one of the DROID DROP FIGHTERS. It EXPLODES.
ANAKIN
"(continuing, laugs)"
"We got him, Artoo!"
ANAKIN BLASTS away at the second DROID DROP FIGHTER as
ARTOO BEEPS an angry warning.
ANAKIN
"I copy, Artoo."
OBI-WAN
I’m going down on the deck.
ANAKIN
Good idea… I need some room to maneuver.
OBI-WAN dives toward the surface of one of the larger TRADE
FEDERATION BATTLESHIPS and is forced to fly through a
"maelstrom of laser flack. He skims the sruface, followed by the"
"DROID DROP FIGHTER, which is followed by ANAKIN."
ANAKIN
(continuing)
Cut right. Do you hear me?! Cut right. Don’t let him get a handle on
"you. Come on, Artoo, lock on! Lock on!"
ARTOO BEEPS. The crosshairs merge on the DROID DROP
FIGHTER.
OBI-WAN
Hurry up! I don’t like this!
OBI-WAN flies through a narrow gap beween two towers on a
Battleship. The DROID DROP FIGHTER hits one of Obi-Wan’s wings
"with a laser blast, and parts of the ship go flying around Obi-Wan’s"
"Astro Droid, ARFOUR."
OBI-WAN
(continuing)
Ouch!
R-4 BEEPS a blue streak.
OBI-WAN
(continuing)
"Don’t even try to fix it, Arfour. I’ve shut it down."
ANAKIN
We’re locked on… we’ve got him…
ANAKIN drops behind the DROID DROP FIGHTER and blows him
apart. ARTOO SQUEALS with delight.
ANAKIN
(continuing)
"Yeah! We got him… good going, Artoo."
OBI-WAN
Next time you’re the bait… Now let’s find the Command Ship and get
on with it…
R-4 BEEPS a blue streak.
ANAKIN
"Lock onto them, Artoo. Master, General Grievous’s ship is directly"
ahead.
"ARTOO BEEPS a reply, and it reads out in Anakin’s cockpit."
ANAKIN
(continuing)
The one crawing with vulture droids.
6 INT. OBI-WAN’S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT –
SPACE 6
OBI-WAN
"I see it. Oh, this is going to be easy."
Ahead is a TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER with batlike DROID
VULTURE FIGHTERS stalking around on the hull. The VULTURE
"FIGHTERS transform into flight configurations, lift off the cruiser, and"
attack the JEDI STARFIGHTERS.
ANAKIN
"Come on, Master."
OBI-WAN
"Not this time. There’s too much at stake. We need help. Odd Ball, do"
you copy?
ODD BALL (OS)
"Copy, Red Leader."
OBI-WAN
Mark my position and form your squad up behind me…
7 INT. ODD BALL’S FIGHTER COCKPIT – SPACE 7
ODD BALL
"We’re on your tail, General Kenobi. Set S-foils in attack position."
The protective ray shield lowers on the main hangar of the TRADE
"FEDERATION CRUISER, and six new DROID TRI FIGHTERS"
emerge and join the DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS heading toward
the Jedi. The JEDI STARFIGHTERS extend the stability foils on the
ends of their wings.
8 INT. ANAKIN’S FIGHTER COCKPIT – SPACE
8
ANAKIN
"This is where the fun begins. Ten Vulture Droids straight ahead,"
coming down the left side.
ARTOO BEEPS a worried message.
OBI-WAN
Add five Tri-fighters on the right…
ANAKIN
I’m going head to head. See you.
OBI-WAN
"Take it easy, Anakin."
Four Clone Fighters move into formation behind the Jedi.
ODD BALL
"I’m on your right, Red Leader."
ANAKIN
Incoming!!
ARTOO SQUEALS as five DROID TRI-FIGHTERS pass by at high
speed on the right.
OBI-WAN
Five more on the right!
Four more VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS pass at high speed from
the left. All hell breaks loose. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN continue to fly in
"unison, backing up each other. ARTOO SQUEALS."
ANAKIN
Here we go.
The Jedi ships split up and make a quick loop around the DROID
"TRI-FIGHTERS, ending up behind them, BLASTING away. The"
DROID TRI-FIGHTERS EXPLODE.
OBI-WAN
I’m going high and right.
ANAKIN
Hang on. There are four more of them.
OBI-WAN
Stay with me… swing back and right… help me engage. Back off…
Let them pass between us.
ANAKIN
I’m coming around. I’m coming around your tail.
OBI-WAN
"All right, engage… and hurry. These droids are all over me like a"
rash.
"In one incredible move, ANAKIN swings in behind the DROID TRIFIGHTERS,"
blowing them away one by one until there is only one
left. ARTOO CHIRPS.
ARTOO lets out a HOWL as ANAKIN accelerates past the last
"DROID TRI-FIGHTER, slams on his brakes, flips the Fighter around,"
and BLASTS the Fighter from the front. ARTOO BEEPS frantically as
they fly through the debris of the destroyed ships. ANAKIN looks
behind him.
ANAKIN
"How many back there, Artoo? (Artoo beeps) Three… (continuing)"
Four… that’s not good.
OBI-WAN
"Anakin, you have four on your tail."
ANAKIN
"I know, I know!"
OBI-WAN
Four more closing from your left.
ANAKIN
"I know, I know!"
OBI-WAN
Break right and go high.
ANAKIN
I’m going low and left.
Obi-Wan shakes his head.
OBI-WAN
(to himself)
He still has much to learn.
ANAKIN swoops low and skims across a TRADE FEDERATION
"BATTLESHIP, dodging flack as ARTOO bounces along, trying to get"
out a sentence.
ANAKIN
"Hang on, Artoo. Obi-Wan, do you copy? I’m going to pull them"
through the needle . . .
OBI-WAN
Too dangerous. First Jedi rule
“Survive.”
ANAKIN
"Sorry, no choice. Come down here and thin them out a little."
OBI-WAN drops in behind the DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS chasing
Anakin. ARFOUR BEEPS to OBI-WAN.
OBI-WAN
Just keep me steady . . . hold on … not yet. . . now break left.
OBI-WAN fires as he swings across the back of the VULTURE
"DROIDS, BLASTING four of them away. ANAKIN heads for a trench"
along the surface of one of the Trade Federation Battleships. He flies
"into the trench, which ends in a conning tower with a small slit"
between two main struts.
OBI-WAN
"(continuing) You’ll never get through there, Anakin. It’s too tight."
ARTOO BEEPS nervously.
ANAKIN
"Easy, Artoo . . . we’ve done this before."
OBI-WAN
"Use the Force, think yourself through, the ship will follow."
ARTOO SQUEALS in a panic. On the view screen Artoo’s squeal
"reads out, “WE’RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT.”"
ANAKIN
"Wrong thought, Artoo."
ANAKIN slips through the narrow gap. The trailing VULTURE DROID
FIGHTERS CRASH.
ANAKIN
(continuing) I’m through.
"OBI-WAN continues to fire on the VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS,"
driving them into the EXPLOSION.
"A CLONE fighter is hit and explodes, spewing debris. The CLONE"
PILOT spins off into space.
"Finally, OBI-WAN peels off and swings around, pulling up alongside"
ANAKIN. CLONE FIGHT SQUAD SEVEN battles the DROIDS.
ODD BALL
There are too many of them.
CLONE PILOT 2
I’m on your wing. Break left. Break left. They’re all over me. Get them
off my . . .
ANAKIN
I’m going to go help them out!
OBI-WAN
"No, no! They are doing their job so we can do ours. Head for the"
Command Ship!
"Another CLONE fighter is hit, bursts into flames, and spins off into"
space. A VULTURE DROID FIGHTER raises its head to locate its
target and fires missiles at them.
ANAKIN
Missiles! Pull up!
"ANAKIN and OBI-WAN break right and left, and the missiles follow"
"them. ANAKIN does a barrel roll spin, causing the missiles following"
him to collide and EXPLODE. Two missiles continue to chase OBIWAN.
"He banks sharply to the right, then to the left, causing one of"
the missiles to overshoot.
OBI-WAN
They overshot us . . .
The second missile streaks next to Obi-Wan’s Fighter and
"EXPLODES. Obi-Wan’s ship rocks, and R-4, SCREAMS as the"
Starfighter rips through the explosion. Debris flies all around them.
ANAKIN
They’re coming around!
OBI-WAN
"All right, Arfour. No, no. Nothing too fancy."
ANAKIN
Surge all power units. Artoo! Stand by the reverse thrusters.
ANAKIN spins his starfighter. The missiles spin and collide.
ANAKIN
We got ‘em. Artoo!
Two missiles continue to track Obi-Wan.
OBI-WAN
Flying is for droids.
"Suddenly, OBI-WAN shudders, and his ship starts to plummet toward"
the surface of the Trade Federation Cruiser. The trailing missiles fly
"into what looks like debris, and detonate. Five silver balls fly out of"
"the debris and attach themselves to the ship. The balls pop open,"
revealing SMALL BUZZDROIDS that begin to crawl across the
surface like spiders.
OBI-WAN
(continuing) I’m hit! Anakin?
ANAKIN
I see them . . . Buzz Droids.
The BUZZ DROIDS crawl across Obi-Wan’s ship and start to tear it
apart. SPARKS ERUPT where the BUZZ DROIDS break into the
wiring. One of the BUZZ DROIDS goes after ARFOUR.
OBI-WAN
"Arfour, be careful. You have one . . ."
ARFOUR’s head gets ripped off and flies away.
OBI-WAN
Oh dear. They’re shutting down all the controls.
ANAKIN
Move to the right so I can get a clear shot at them.
OBI-WAN
The mission. Get to the Command Ship. Get the Chancellor! I’m
running out of tricks here.
ANAKIN moves into position just off Obi-Wan’s left side and angles
his ship so his guns are pointing at the DROIDS crawling over Obi-
Wan’s Starfighter. ANAKIN fires and vaporizes the TWO BUZZ
"DROIDS, along with the left wing of Obi-Wan’s ship."
OBI-WAN
(continuing) In the name of …
ANAKIN
Steady . . . steady . . .
OBI-WAN
"Anakin, hold your fire . . . hold your fire. You’re not helping here."
ANAKIN
"I agree, bad idea. Swing right . . . ease over . . . steady . . ."
OBI-WAN
Wait . . . wait . . . I can’t see a thing! My cockpit’s fogging. They’re all
"over me, Anakin."
ANAKIN
Move to the right.
OBI-WAN
"Hold on, Anakin. You’re going to get us both killed! Get out of here."
There’s nothing more you can do.
ANAKIN
"I’m not leaving without you, Master."
ANAKIN moves his ship next to OBI-WAN’s and tries to physically
knock the BUZZ DROIDS off. There are five left. He manages to get
"one off, but badly dents OBI-WAN’s ship in the process. One of the"
BUZZ DROIDS tears apiece off of the front of Obi-Wan’s ship.
"Flames burst out, and more smoke billows out, obscuring the Jedi’s"
view.
ANAKIN knocks off three of the BUZZ DROIDS and the fourth crawls
out onto Anakin’s ship and starts attacking ARTOO. ARTOO fights
the BUZZ DROID.
OBI-WAN
Blast it … I can’t see . . . my controls are gone.
ANAKIN
"Get ‘em, Artoo. Watch out!"
OBI-WAN
"Artoo, hit the buzz droid’s center eye."
ARTOO extends an arm and aims a stream of electricity at the
swerving BUZZ DROID. The BUZZ DROID is hit squarely in the eye
and falls off the ship.
ANAKIN
"Yeah, you got him!"
OBI-WAN
"Great, Artoo."
ANAKIN
Stay on my wing . . . the General’s Command Ship is dead ahead.
Easy . . . pull up … Head for the hangar.
OBI-WAN
Have you noticed the shields are still up?
ANAKIN
"Oh?!? Sorry, Master."
ANAKIN streaks ahead of OBI-WAN’s disintegrating Jedi Fighter and
blasts the shield generator. It SPARKS and EXPLODES.
OBI-WAN
"Oh, I have a bad feeling about this."
9 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
"The shield door drops away, and OBI-WAN crashes on the deck of"
"the hangar bay, engulfed in a FANTAIL OF SPARKS. A set of blast"
"doors starts SLAMMING shut across the hangar opening, as material"
is sucked into space.
ANAKIN maneuvers around the oncoming junk and flies into the
hangar just as the blast doors SLAM shut.
OBI-WAN ignites his light saber and cuts his way out of the cockpit.
He jumps dear just as his ship EXPLODES. BATTLE DROIDS rush at
him from all directions.
ANAKIN jumps out of his ship and cuts his way through the BATTLE
DROIDS to where OBI-WAN is fighting. ARTOO pops out of the ship
and follows ANAKIN.
OBI-WAN
"Artoo, locate the Chancellor."
ANAKIN
Tap into the ship’s computers.
They cut down the last of the droids and follow ARTOO over to a
computer wall socket. The two JEDI fight off FOUR MORE DROIDS
"as ARTOO tries to find the Chancellor. Finally, a HOLOGRAM of the"
Trade Federation ship appears.
OBI-WAN
The Chancellor’s signal is coming from right there. The observation
platform at the top of that spire.
ANAKIN
I sense Count Dooku . . .
OBI-WAN
I sense a trap.
ANAKIN
Next move?
OBI-WAN
Spring the trap.
The JEDI start to leave; ARTOO follows. The JEDI stop and turn to
ARTOO.
ANAKIN
"Artoo, go back. I need you to stay with the ship."
OBI-WAN
"Here, take this, and wait for orders."
OBI-WAN tosses the comlink to ARTOO.
10 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
GENERAL GRIEVOUS enters the bridge of the TRADE
FEDERATION cruiser followed by his TWO BODYGUARDS. He
walks to the front of the bridge and stands in front of the
NEIMOIDIAN CAPTAIN.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
"What’s the situation, Captain?"
CAPTAIN
TWO Jedi have landed in the main hangar bay.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
Just as Count Dooku predicted.
11 INT. HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
ANAKIN and OBI-WAN head for the elevator. A door opens in the
hallway and two of GENERAL GRIEVOUS’s BODYGUARDS confront
the JEDI.
BODYGUARD I
"General Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker. We’ve been waiting for you."
OBI-WAN
"We are here to relieve you of Chancellor Palpatine, not join him."
"As a dozen more droids join the group, the JEDI ignite their"
lightsabers and stand back-to-back.
OBI-WAN
Anakin. . .
ANAKIN
Ready.
ANAKIN and OBI-WAN use their lightsabers and cut a large circle in
the floor.
12 INT. GENERATOR ROOM-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
The TWO JEDI cut their way down several floors into a large
generator room. Huge EXPLOSIONS outside the ship have caused
"several large pipes overhead to break, and fluid is spewing"
everywhere. The Jedi get up and turn off their light sabers. ANAKIN
dips his hand into the fluid and sniffs it.
OBI-WAN
. . . fuel. The slightest charge from our sabers will send this ship into
oblivion. That’s why they’ve stopped shooting.
ANAKIN
"Well then, we’re safe for the time being."
OBI-WAN
Your idea of safe is not the same as mine.
"They run, EXPLOSIONS rattle the ship, and pipes continue to burst"
"around them, spilling more fuel into the hallway. At the far end, SIX"
SUPER BATTLE DROIDS drop into the fuel. The SOUNDS OF
SHIELD DOORS CLOSING AND LOCKING ECHO throughout the
"hallway. They pass several large power generators, which are topped"
with SPARKING excess power dischargers.
ANAKIN
They’re sealing this section off.
OBI-WAN
Six droids coming our way!
The last of the DOORS CAN BE HEARD CLOSING in the distance.
ANAKIN
Keep moving. There must be vents . . . This way.
They move along a wall. ANAKIN climbs up the side to a small vent.
The fuel gets closer to the SPARKING dischargers.
OBI-WAN
We’ll never get through that. It’s too small!
They move toward a second vent. OBI-WAN is swimming in the fuel
as it reaches to within a couple yards of the ceiling. ANAKIN feels
along the ceiling and finds another smaller vent. He closes his eyes
"and tries to sense an opening, then he moves on. OBI-WAN is forced"
into hand-to-hand combat with one of the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS.
"It pulls the Jedi under the fuel. Just before he is about to drown, OBIWAN"
disables the SUPER BATTLE DROID by pushing him into an
exhaust pipe.
"The fuel is up to the Jedi’s chins. ANAKIN finds a very, very small"
"metal grate, then pounds on it until the tiny grate breaks loose."
ANAKIN
I found our escape vent.
OBI-WAN
"Anakin, this is no time for jokes. We’re in serious trouble here."
ANAKIN
"Only in your mind. My Master. Look, no structure. . . ."
"ANAKIN grabs the side of the tiny hole and gives it a big yank, ripping"
a large panel loose revealing a “man-sized” work shaft. They
scramble through it as the DROIDS swim closer.
13 INT. VENT SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
The TWO JEDI pull themselves through the narrow vent shaft until
they reach a small hatch in the side of the tube.
ANAKIN
Here’s a way out.
As the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS reach the opening in the ceiling and
"the fuel gets to within a few feet of the power generator sparks, the"
"JEDI work the keyboard on the pressure lock, opening the latch."
14 INT. SMALL PASSAGEWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
The TWO JEDI climb into a small passageway and slam the hatch
shut. They make their way through the ever-shrinking shaft until they
reach the end.
15 INT. HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
A hatch opens in one of the main hallways of the Trade Federation
"Cruiser, and the JEDI squeeze out, SLAMMING the hatch. Behind"
"them, ANAKIN seals the hatch with his laser sword."
OBI-WAN
That won’t hold when the fuel hits those power dischargers.
ANAKIN
The blast will break the hull. This side’s pressurized.
OBI-WAN
"You still have much to learn, Anakin."
16 INT. VENT SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
The SUPER BATTLE DROIDS climb up the vent shaft. SUPER
BATTLE DROID R77 and SEVERAL OTHER DROIDS wait in the
generator room as the fuel continues to rise toward the power
discharger.
SUPER BATTLE DROID R77
I have a bad feeling about this.
17 INT. GENERATOR ROOM-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
"The fuel hits the SPARKING power discharger, and there is a HUGE"
EXPLOSION.
18 EXT. TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER-BATTLE
A GREAT EXPLOSION and a flaming gas cloud spray out of the side
of the Federation Cruiser.
19 INT. HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
A large bulge appears in the wall around the sealed hatch as the
"EXPLOSION hits. OBI-WAN jumps back, then stands amazed."
OBI-WAN
"All right, you win. I have much to learn. Let’s go!"
"ANAKIN grins at OBI-WAN, and they run down the hallway."
20 INT. WIDE HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
The two JEDI wait for an elevator to arrive. They turn around and see
they are face to face with THREE DESTROYER DROIDS. The
DROIDS start blasting away. Anakin deflects the bolts. OBI-WAN
frantically pushes the elevator button several more times.
ANAKIN
Destroyers!!
"Finally the door opens, and they rush inside under a hail of laser"
bolts. The elevator door slides shut. The JEDI turn to see BATTLE
DROIDS standing behind them.
BATTLE DROID
Drop your weapons! I said drop ‘em.
The JEDI activate their light sabers and destroy all the BATTLE
DROIDS.
21 INT HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
R2-D2 notices two SUPER BATTLE DROIDS entering the hangar.
He moves and hides behind a Jedi Starfighter.
22 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
The elevator begins to move and screeches to a stop.
OBI-WAN
Did you press the stop button?
ANAKIN
"No, did you?"
OBI-WAN
No!
ANAKIN
"Well, there’s more than one way out of here."
ANAKIN ignites his laser sword.
OBI-WAN
"We don’t want to get out, we want to get moving. Artoo . . . Artoo. Do"
you copy? Activate elevator . . . (looks at control panel) . . . 31174 . . .
ANAKIN cuts a hole in the elevator ceiling.
23 INT MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS are inspecting the Jedi starfighters.
They overhear Obi-Wan’s voice over the comlink and are distracted.
SUPER BATTLE DROID 1
What’s that?
SUPER BATTLE DROID 2
Get back to work. It’s nothing.
24 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
OBI-WAN
Artoo?
ANAKIN climbs through the hole in the ceiling of the elevator.
OBI-WAN
(continuing) Always on the move.
OBI-WAN continues to talk on the comlink. Artoo quietly beeps a
reply.
25 INT MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
ARTOO tries to muffle the comlink as the TWO SUPER BATTLE
DROIDS try to figure out where the voices are coming from. ARTOO
extends an arm and plugs into a computer interface.
OBI-WAN
"(OS) Artoo, switch on the comlink. Artoo, do you hear me? Artoo, we"
gave you a job to do! Artoo.
26 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
"Suddenly, the elevator plummets down the shaft. ANAKIN quickly"
jumps and grabs onto the hallway entry door. He watches as the
elevator recedes down the shaft and disappears. ANAKIN struggles
to keep his grip on the closed door as SPARKING wires rain down on
him.
27 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
The elevator starts to descend rapidly.
OBI-WAN
"Stop, stop! Artoo, we need to be going up."
28 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
Anakin struggles to hang on to the narrow edge of the elevator shaft.
"The door to the elevator shaft is pried open, and TWO BATTLE"
DROIDS appear in the doorway and look down at ANAKIN. They
point their guns at him.
DROID 1
"Hands up, Jedi! Don’t move."
DROID 2
"Roger, roger."
29 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
The TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS overhear OBI-WAN’s comlink
messages to ARTOO.
SUPER BATTLE DROID 1
There it is again.
OBI-WAN
"(OS) Artoo, do you copy? Artoo, do you hear me? Artoo, we need to"
"be going up, not down."
30 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
The elevator races down as OBI-WAN holds on.
OBI-WAN
"Stop. Artoo! We need to go up! Stop, stop!"
The elevator stops with a jolt. OBI-WAN falls to the floor.
31 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
The TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS see ARTOO and walk toward
the little droid.
SUPER BATTLE DROID 1
Hey you!
ARTOO plugs into the interface again and the elevator shoots up.
32 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
OBI-WAN stands up after having fallen in the elevator.
OBI-WAN
"Now, that’s better . . ."
33 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
"ARTOO is held up by TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS, who chuckle"
as the little Astro Droid curses and swings at them.
SUPER BATTLE DROID 1
You stupid little astro droid!
34 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
ANAKIN looks down and sees the elevator heading toward him at a
high rate of speed. He looks at the BATTLE DROIDS leaning over
"him with their guns pointed at him. He calculates for a moment, then"
gives himself a push and flips himself up into the elevator shaft.
"Before ANAKIN can arc into a descent down the shaft, the elevator"
"races up through the shaft, cutting the DROIDS in two. ANAKIN lands"
on the elevator and quickly drops back through the hole in the ceiling.
OBI-WAN is startled and ignites his lightsaber.
OBI-WAN
"Oh, it’s you . . ."
35 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
ARTOO activates his oil hose and sprays the SUPER BATTLE
DROIDS. The SUPER BATTLE DROIDS slip on the oil.
36 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
ANAKIN
What was that all about?
OBI-WAN
"Well, Artoo has been . . ."
ANAKIN
No loose wire jokes . . . He’s doing the best he can.
OBI-WAN
Did I say anything?
ANAKIN
He’s trying!
OBI-WAN
I didn’t say anything!
37 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
"ARTOO ignites his arm rockets and shoots out of their grip, spraying"
them both with oil and setting them on fire. The SUPER BATTLE
"DROIDS slip and slide until they fall, smoldering. ARTOO rolls away."
38 INT. GENERAL’S QUARTER’S-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
The elevator door opens and the TWO JEDI carefully make their way
into the main room of the General’s Quarters.
At the far end sits SUPREME CHANCELLOR PALPATINE. ANAKIN
and OBI-WAN move toward the CHANCELLOR.
"As they get closer to PALPATINE, they see a very distressed look on"
the Chancellor’s face.
OBI-WAN
(bows) Chancellor.
ANAKIN
Are you all right?
PALPATINE
(quietly) Count Dooku.
PALPATINE makes a small gesture with his hand. OBI-WAN and
ANAKIN turn around. The elevator DOORS CAN BE HEARD
OPENING AND CLOSING as COUNT DOOKU strides into the room.
"He is above the Jedi, standing on a balcony, with two SUPER"
BATTLE DROIDS. The Jedi turn to see him. He looks down on the
Jedi.
OBI-WAN
(quietly to Anakin) This time we will do it together.
ANAKIN
I was about to say that.
COUNT DOOKU jumps down to the main level.
PALPATINE
Get help! You’re no match for him. He’s a Sith Lord.
OBI-WAN
"Chancellor Palpatine, Sith Lords are our specialty."
OBI-WAN and ANAKIN throw off their cloaks and ignite their
lightsabers.
COUNT DOOKU
"Your swords, please, Master Jedi. We don’t want to make a mess of"
things in front of the Chancellor.
OBI-WAN and ANAKIN move toward DOOKU.
OBI-WAN
"You won’t get away this time, Dooku."
OBI-WAN and ANAKIN charge COUNT DOOKU. A great sword fight
ensues.
COUNT DOOKU
I’ve been looking forward to this.
ANAKIN
"My powers have doubled since the last time we met, Count."
COUNT DOOKU
"Good. Twice the pride, double the fall."
DOOKU lunges at the JEDI and they fall back . . .
COUNT DOOKU
"(continuing) Your moves are clumsy, Kenobi . . . too predictable."
You’ll have to do better.
"As the battle proceeds, OBI-WAN and COUNT DOOKU are tired."
ANAKIN is stronger as he becomes angry. ANAKIN continues to
drive the attack on DOOKU. COUNT DOOKU throws OBI-WAN back
using the Force.
ANAKIN and COUNT DOOKU move up the stairs. As they reach the
"upper landing of the General’s Quarters, ANAKIN leaps over COUNT"
"DOOKU. OBI-WAN reaches the top of the stairs, destroying TWO"
SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. COUNT DOOKU holds OBI-WAN in the
air using the Force as he turns and kicks ANAKIN out of frame. OBIWAN
is choking.
ANAKIN hits the archway.
DOOKU sends OBI-WAN flying. The Jedi tumbles to the lower level
"unconscious. COUNT DOOKU spins around again and, using the"
"Force, causes a section of the balcony to drop onto OBI-WAN."
"ANAKIN spins and kicks COUNT DOOKU, sending him over the"
"balcony. ANAKIN Jumps, following him down to the main floor."
COUNT DOOKU and ANAKIN continue the fight.
COUNT DOOKU
"(continuing) I sense great fear in you, Skywalker. You have hate, you"
"have anger, but you don’t use them."
Anakin regains his composure and attacks COUNT DOOKU as the
Dark Lord continues his spin to meet him head on. Their fighting
becomes even more intense.
Anakin attacks COUNT DOOKU with a new ferociousness.
39 INT. GENERAL’S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
"Anakin and Dooku continue their fight. It is intense! Finally, in one last"
"energized charge, ANAKIN cuts off COUNT DOOKU’s hands. The"
Jedi catches the lightsaber as it drops from the severed Sith Lord’s
hand. COUNT DOOKU stumbles to the floor as ANAKIN puts the two
lightsabers to his neck. PALPATINE is grinning as he watches
COUNT DOOKU’s defeat.
PALPATINE
"Good, Anakin, good. I knew you could do it. Kill him. Kill him now!"
ANAKIN
I shouldn’t . . .
PALPATINE
Do it!!
ANAKIN cuts off COUNT DOOKU’s head. A huge EXPLOSION
somewhere deep in the ship rattles everything.
ANAKIN
… I couldn’t stop myself.
PALPATINE
"You did well, Anakin. He was too dangerous to be kept alive."
"ANAKIN drops COUNT DOOKU’s lightsaber, moving to PALPATINE."
ANAKIN
"Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner."
"ANAKIN raises his hands toward PALPATINE, who is strapped in the"
Admiral’s Chair. The Chancellor’s restraints pop loose.
ANAKIN
"(continuing) I shouldn’t have done that, Chancellor. It’s not the Jedi"
way.
"PALPATINE stands up, rubbing his wrists."
PALPATINE
"It is only natural. He cut off your arm, and you wanted revenge. It"
"wasn’t the first time, Anakin. Remember what you told me about your"
"mother and the Sand People. Now, we must leave before more"
security droids arrive.
"The ship begins to list to one side. ANAKIN rushes over to OBI-WAN,"
"lifts the control console from on top of him, and pulls him free. He"
kneels down and checks out his unconscious friend. PALPATINE
heads for the elevators.
PALPATINE
"(continuing) Anakin, there is no time. We must get off the ship before"
it’s too late.
ANAKIN
"He seems to be all right. No broken bones, breathing’s all right."
PALPATINE
"Leave him, or we’ll never make it."
ANAKIN
His fate will be the same as ours.
"ANAKIN picks up OBI-WAN, slings him over his shoulder, and heads"
for the elevators.
40 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
Prepare for attack.
PILOT
All batteries fire! Fire!
41 INT. BATTLESTATIONS-REPUBLIC CRUISER
Clone gunners fire on the Trade Federation cruiser and take fire in
return. Gun emplacements are destroyed. Clone troopers go flying.
42 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY-GENERAL’S QUARTERS-TRADE
FEDERATION CRUISER
ANAKIN carries OBI-WAN to the elevator doors and hits the button.
PALPATINE joins him.
ANAKIN
"The elevator’s not working, (into his comlink) Artoo . . ."
ARTOO BEEPS a response to ANAKIN.
ANAKIN
(continuing) . . . Activate Elevator 3224.
Suddenly the ship shifts to its side as the elevator doors open.
PALPATINE is thrown to the ground. ANAKIN jumps to the door
frame of the elevator. ANAKIN looks into the elevator shaft.
ANAKIN
"(continuing) Artoo … do you copy? Artoo, come in!"
43 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
"Windows are blown out, droids and equipment are sucked into space."
PILOT
Reverse stabilizers.
44 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
"As the ship rolls, spacecraft and equipment CRASH from one side of"
the ship to the other.
"Several objects break through the metal blast doors, causing objects"
to be sucked into space. ARTOO starts to slide toward one of the
small holes.
45 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY-GENERAL’S QUARTERS-TRADE
FEDERATION CRUISER
"As the elevator shaft rotates, it has become a long hallway."
"ANAKIN clings to the doorframe with OBI-WAN on his shoulder, as"
the Chancellor struggles to join him.
46 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
ARTOO continues to skid and slide toward open space. He swerves
around boxes and wrecked fighters. One of the BATTLE DROIDS
stumbles and is consumed by the electronic shield in a zap. ARTOO
BEEPS a reply as he dodges the laser blasts of the BATTLE
"DROIDS. One bolt hits very near him, and he SCREAMS in terror."
47 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
PILOT
Magnetize! Magnetize!
48 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
ARTOO is about to be overtaken by a starfighter sliding behind him.
He falls into a heap of broken battle droid parts and the fighter
bounces over him.
49 EXT. SPACE-CORUSCANT
The TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER heads straight down toward
the planet.
50 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY-GENERAL’S QUARTERS-TRADE
FEDERATION CRUISER
ANAKIN jumps into the horizontal elevator shaft with OBI-WAN still
on his shoulder.
ANAKIN
"We can’t wait. Come on, we have to be fast."
PALPATINE climbs into the elevator shaft also. They start running.
"The ship begins to roll again, and the Jedi and the Chancellor are"
forced to jump from one side of the elevator to the other.
51 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
Fire the emergency booster engines.
PILOT
"Leveling out, sir."
52 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT ON SIDE-TRADE FEDERATION
CRUISER
"ANAKIN still carrying OBI-WAN on his back, and PALPATINE run"
down the elevator shaft as it starts to move upright. ANAKIN cuts a
"control box on one of the doors, but before the doors can open, the"
"ship moves to an angle, causing ANAKIN and PALPATINE to start"
sliding down the shaft. ANAKIN grabs some wires in the control box
with one hand. PALPATINE grabs onto the Jedi’s leg. As the ship
"rights itself, they are left hanging in the bottomless elevator shaft."
"53 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT, VERTICAL-TRADE FEDERATION"
CRUISER
"ANAKIN, OBI-WAN, and PALPATINE hang precariously on the side"
of the bottomless elevator shaft. OBI-WAN regains consciousness
and tries to look around.
ANAKIN
Easy. . . . We’re in a bit of a situation.
OBI-WAN
Did I miss something?
OBI-WAN looks down and sees PALPATINE and the bottomless pit.
They hear ARTOO BEEPING on Obi-Wan’s comlink. The ship begins
"to roll, causing the vertical shaft to move into a forty-five-degree"
angle. They hear the elevator brakes release and look up to see the
elevator heading toward them.
ANAKINN
Hold on.
OBI-WAN
What is that?
OBI-WAN and ANAKIN look up to watch the elevator approach them
"at high speed, then OBI-WAN turns to ANAKIN."
OBI-WAN
(continuing) Oops.
ANAKIN
"Artoo, Artoo, shut down the elevator!"
OBI-WAN
Too late! Jump!
They fall about three hundred feet before the tilt of the ship catches
"up with them, and they hit the side of the shaft and slide at great"
speed just ahead of the elevator. The shaft continues to rotate until it
is completely horizontal.
ANAKIN and OBI-WAN take out and throw grappling hooks. The
hooks catch and they continue to fall. All the doors in the elevator
"shaft open up, and the group swings through the open door into a"
hallway. The elevator roars by.
54 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
"ANAKIN, OBI-WAN, and PALPATINE fly through the elevator door"
and land.
OBI-WAN
Let’s see if we can find something in the hangar bay that’s still flyable.
Come on.
ANAKIN
"Artoo, get down here. Artoo, do you copy?"
55 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
"As the Federation Cruiser continues to rotate, ARTOO SQUEALS"
and pokes a periscope out of a pile of broken BATTLE DROID
PARTS. He looks around then rockets up out of the debris.
56 INT. HALLWAY TO HANGAR BAY-TRADE FEDERATION
CRUISER
OBI-WAN and ANAKIN lead PALPATINE down a hallway toward the
hangar bay.
57 INT. DOORWAY TO HANGAR BAY-TRADE FEDERATION
CRUISER
It is extremely windy as bits and pieces are continually sucked into
"space. The hangar bay doors are closed, but great stresses are being"
"exerted as the ship twists, re-entering the atmosphere of Coruscant."
They stop in a doorway leading into the hangar bay.
OBI-WAN
None of those ships will get us anywhere.
ANAKIN
I agree.
PALPATINE
What are we going to do?
ANAKIN
I don’t know.
OBI-WAN
Don’t look at me. I don’t know.
ANAKIN and PALPATINE both look to OBI-WAN. He shrugs his
shoulders. Anakin’s Fighter has been sucked out of the hangar bay
"and is totaled. Suddenly, the ship turns on its side."
ANAKIN
"Here, Chancellor, lock this around your waist, and hold on."
OBI-WAN
We’ll head toward the bridge and see if we can find an escape pod.
ANAKIN hands PALPATINE the end of a cable that is attached to his
utility belt. PALPATINE attaches it around his waist. ANAKIN and
OBI-WAN throw their utility cables to some pipes in the ceiling and
swing to a second set of pipes.
58 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
OBI-WAN grabs onto the pipes that run along what was the ceiling
"and is now the wall. As he moves out into the hangar, TWO SUPER"
BATTLE DROIDS start firing at him. The Jedi ignites his lightsaber
"and deflects the bolts back at the DROIDS, blowing them up."
ANAKIN and PALPATINE follow OBI-WAN along the pipes running
along the ceiling of the hangar. PALPATINE struggles against the
escaping air of the pressurized hangar. PALPATINE loses his grip as
"a pipe breaks, causing a rush of steam, but ANAKIN manages to"
maintain his grasp on the pipe as the CHANCELLOR dangles on the
other end of the utility cable. They are surrounded by SPARKS and
EXPLOSIONS as the ship twists and tries to break apart. ANAKIN
moves out of the steam and struggles to pull PALPATINE back to
safety. ANAKIN is almost pulled loose in the buffeting winds. The
"ceiling behind them buckles, causing pipes to break, creating geysers"
of steam. Some bits of pipe go hurling into the blast doors and out
into space. They make it through a hangar doorway and close it
behind them.
59 INT. HANGAR DOORWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
"OBI-WAN, ANAKIN and PALPATINE are out of breath."
ANAKIN/OBI-WAN
"Well, that was close."
They laugh.
60 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
BODYGUARD
"General, we found the Jedi. They’re in hallway 328."
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
Activate ray shields.
61 INT. HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
"They run down the hallway. Suddenly, ray shields drop around them,"
putting them in an electronic box in the middle of the hallway.
ANAKIN
Ray shields!
OBI-WAN takes a deep breath to express his total disappointment.
OBI-WAN
"Wait a minute, how’d this happen! We’re smarter than this."
ANAKIN
"Apparently not, Master. This is the oldest trap in the book . . . Well …"
I was distracted.
OBI-WAN
"Oh, so all of a sudden it’s my fault."
ANAKIN
You’re the Master. I’m just a hero.
OBI-WAN
I’m open to suggestions here.
PALPATINE
Why don’t we let them take us to General Grievous. Perhaps with
"Count Dooku’s demise, we can negotiate our release."
The Jedi look at each other in disbelief.
ANAKIN
I say . . . patience.
OBI-WAN
"Patience! That’s your plan, is it?"
ANAKIN
"Yes, Artoo will be along in a few moments and he’ll release the ray"
shields . . .
ARTOO comes skidding across the hallway and bashes into the
opposite wall. He takes a moment to compose himself.
ANAKIN
(continuing) See! No problem.
"Suddenly several doorways open, revealing TWO DESTROYER"
DROIDS. SIXTEEN SUPER BATTLE DROIDS emerge from behind
the DESTROYER DROIDS.
ARTOO turns and zaps one of the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS who
then kicks ARTOO over.
SUPER BATTLE DROID
"Don’t move, dummy. Ouch! Zap this."
OBI-WAN
Do you have a plan B?
62 EXT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
"OBI-WAN, ANAKIN PALPATINE, and ARTOO are captured by"
GENERAL GRIEVOUS. They stand before the ALIEN DROID
GENERAL.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
"Oh yes. General Kenobi, the Negotiator. We’ve been waiting for you."
That wasn’t much of a rescue.
A BATTLE DROID walks to GENERAL GRIEVOUS and hands him
the JEDI’S lightsabers.
OBI-WAN
That depends upon your point of view. Hah!
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
And Anakin Skywalker … I was expecting someone with your
reputation to be a little older.
ANAKIN
General Grievous . . . Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies.
You’re shorter than I expected.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
"Ahhhh, Jedi scum . . ."
OBI-WAN
"Anakin, try not to upset him. We have a job to do."
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
Your lightsabers will make a fine addition to my collection.
OBI-WAN
Not this time. And this time you won’t escape.
ANAKIN
Artoo.
"ARTOO creates a distraction by extending all his arms, shooting out"
"electrical pulses, and bouncing around."
"OBI-WAN, hands restrained with electrobonds, spins around, reaches"
"out and, using the Force, yanks his lightsaber out of the General’s"
"hand, ignites it, and cuts his bonds. He continues to spin around and"
cuts Anakin free.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
Crush them! Make them suffer!
ANAKIN uses the Force to yank his lightsaber out of the General’s
hand.
The DROIDS that surround them begin to FIRE. OBI-WAN and
ANAKIN jump into the line of fire. The bridge degenerates into chaos.
OBI-WAN and ANAKIN are locked in a pitched battle between electro
staffs and laser swords with GENERAL GRIEVOUS’s TWO
BODYGUARDS.
CHANCELLOR PALPATINE is taken away by two BATTLE DROIDS.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS walks around the bridge directing the
BATTLE DROIDS.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
Stay and watch your stations.
OBI-WAN fights one of General Grievous’s BODYGUARDS. The
BODYGUARD carries an electrified staff about five feet long. When
"the laser sword hits it, electrical bolts fly everywhere and surround the"
laser sword. OBI-WAN is unable to cut the staff. The Jedi gets
whacked pretty good a couple of times and is knocked halfway
across the bridge.
"OBI-WAN pulls himself together and attacks again, cutting off the"
DROID BODYGUARD’S head. The DROID BODYGUARD keeps
attacking. ANAKIN struggles to defend himself against the other
manic DROID BODYGUARD. He cuts the DROID BODYGUARD in
half. TWO BATTLE DROIDS try to take the CHANCELLOR away.
"ANAKIN follows them down the hallway and cuts them down,"
rescuing the Chancellor.
OBI-WAN finishes off the headless BODYGUARD. It crumbles to the
floor in pieces.
ALARMS SOUND as the giant spacecraft begins to list and fall out of
orbit. A PILOT yells at GENERAL GRIEVOUS.
PILOT
"Sir, we are falling out of orbit. All aft control cells are dead."
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
Stay on course . . . Don’t bother with them. Keep the ship in orbit.
OBI-WAN and ANAKIN destroy the remaining DROIDS. GENERAL
GRIEVOUS retrieves one of the BODYGUARD’S staffs and faces
OBI-WAN. ANAKIN leaps over a console and lands behind
GENERAL GRIEVOUS.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
"You lose, General Kenobi."
One of the PILOTS stands next to the General.
PILOT
The ship is breaking up!
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
We’ve run out of time.
OBI-WAN tries to get at GENERAL GRIEVOUS. ANAKIN runs at the
General from the opposing side. GENERAL GRIEVOUS turns and
"throws his electrified staff at the window. It breaks, causing chaos as"
everything that is not nailed down is sucked into space. GENERAL
GRIEVOUS is the first one sucked out into space. He fires a cable
from his arm that attaches to the ship. He swings in and lands firmly
on the side of the ship.
"OBI-WAN, ANAKIN, and PALPATINE hold on for dear life. A blast"
shield closes around where the window used to be.
63 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
OBI-WAN continues to fight the BATTLE DROIDS. The DROIDS
have backed him into a corner. OBI-WAN hides behind a control
panel as the DROIDS blast away at him. He jumps up and over the
"DROIDS, cutting most of them down before he lands. He destroys the"
DROIDS and joins ANAKIN.
ANAKIN and OBI-WAN cut through the rest of the DROIDS as if they
were made of butter. PALPATINE stands in shock as he watches the
carnage. Droid parts are firing everywhere. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN
stand back to back and cut down the last of the DROIDS just as there
"is a huge shudder, followed by more alarms. SPARKS begin to fly"
outside the windows.
PALPATINE
The hull is burning up!
64 EXT. HULL-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER-SPACE
GENERAL GRIEVOUS detaches his cable and crawls along the
"exterior hull of the Federation Cruiser, using his magnetized hands"
and feet. He reaches a row of escape pods and enters an airlock.
65 INT. POD BAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER-SPACE
GENERAL GRIEVOUS enters the escape pod bay through the hatch.
The Droid General goes to a control panel and opens an escape pod.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
Time to abandon ship.
"GENERAL GRIEVOUS pulls a row of switches, and one by one the"
escape pods are jettisoned.
66 INT. ESCAPE POD-SPACE
"He gets in one, the hatch closes, and the escape pod blasts away"
from the damaged Cruiser.
67 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
OBI-WAN and ANAKIN go over to the navigator’s chair.
ANAKIN
All the escape pods have been launched.
OBI-WAN
Grievous. Can you fly a cruiser like this?
ANAKIN
"You mean, do I know how to land what’s left of this thing?"
ANAKIN sits in the pilot’s chair and sees on a screen the back half of
"the ship break away. There is a great jolt, and the ship tilts forward."
OBI-WAN
Well?
ANAKIN
"Under the circumstances, I’d say the ability to pilot this thing is"
irrelevant. Strap yourselves in.
OBI-WAN and PALPATINE strap themselves into chairs. ANAKIN
"struggles with the controls of the ship. The ship starts to glow, and"
pieces break off. ARTOO moves in on Palpatine ‘s controls and
assists in flying the cruiser.
OBI-WAN
Steady . . . Attitude . . . eighteen degrees.
ARTOO beeps.
ANAKIN
"Pressure rising. We’ve got to slow this wreck down. Open all hatches,"
"extend all flaps, and drag fins."
OBI-WAN
"Temp steady. Hatches open, flaps extended, drag fins . . ."
A large part of the ship breaks away.
ANAKIN
We lost something.
OBI-WAN
"Not to worry, we’re still flying half the ship."
ANAKIN
Now we’re really picking up speed . . . I’m going to shift a few
degrees and see if I can slow us down.
OBI-WAN
Careful . . . we’re heating up-twelve thousand . . . thirteen thousand . .
.
ANAKIN
What’s our speed?
OBI-WAN
Eight plus sixty-forty. Eight plus sixty-twenty. Eight plus sixty. Temp
"ten thousand, nine thousand . . . we’re in the atmosphere . . ."
ANAKIN points to one of the controls. ARTOO beeps madly.
ANAKIN
Grab that . . . Keep us level.
OBI-WAN
Steady. Steady.
ANAKIN
"Easy, Artoo. Hang on, this may get a little rough. We lost our heat"
shields.
OBI-WAN
Five thousand. Three thousand . . . two thousand. Fireships on the
left and the right.
FlRESHIP PILOT
We’ll take you in.
OBI-WAN
Copy that. Landing strip’s straight ahead.
ANAKIN
We’re coming in too hot.
OBI-WAN
Easy-easy.
The ship leaves a contrail as it streaks across the Coruscant skyline.
PALPATINE and OBI-WAN hold on for dear life as the ship shakes
and rattles toward an industrial landing platform.
68 EXT. CORUSCANT-INDUSTRIAL LANDING PLATFORMAFTERNOON
A large landing platform in the industrial part of the city is surrounded
by Emergency Fire Speeders. The smoking ship approaches as five
Fireships spray it with foam. The ship finally makes a rather hard
landing.
OBI-WAN
Another happy landing.
69 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-LANDING
PLATFORM-LATE AFTERNOON
The small Jedi Shuttle carrying PALPATINE and the JEDI arrives at
"the landing platform. There are a DOZEN SENATORS, including"
"BAIL ORGANA, JAR JAR BINKS, and C-3PO, waiting for them."
"PALPATINE, R2-D2, and ANAKIN get out. OBI-WAN and MACE stay"
in the doorway of the Jedi Shuttle.
ANAKIN
"(to Obi-Wan) Are you coming, Master?"
OBI-WAN
Oh no. I’m not brave enough for politics. I have to report to the
"Council. Besides, someone needs to be the poster boy."
ANAKIN
"Hold on, this whole operation was your idea. You planned it. You led"
the rescue operation. You have to be the one to take the bows this
time.
OBI-WAN
"Sorry, old friend. Let us not forget that you rescued me from the Buzz"
"Droids. And you killed Count Dooku. And you rescued the Chancellor,"
"carrying me unconscious on your back, and you managed to land that"
bucket of bolts safely . . .
ANAKIN
"All because of your training, Master. You deserve all those speeches"
of your greatness.
OBI-WAN
". . . the endless speeches . . . Anakin, let’s be fair. Today, you are the"
hero and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians.
ANAKIN
All right. But you owe me . . . and not for saving your skin for the tenth
time . . .
OBI-WAN
Ninth time . . . that business on Cato Nemoidia doesn’t count. I’ll see
you at the briefing.
ANAKIN smiles and walks away from OBI-WAN.
The CHANCELLOR and his entourage approach MACE.
MACE WINDU
"Chancellor Palpatine, what a welcome sight! Are you all right?"
PALPATINE
"Yes, thanks to your two Jedi Knights. They killed Count Dooku, but"
General Grievous has escaped once again.
MACE WINDU
General Grievous will run and hide as he always does. He is a
coward.
PALPATINE
"That maybe true, but with Count Dooku dead, he is the leader of the"
"Droid Army, and I assure you, the Senate will vote to continue the"
war as long as Grievous is alive.
MACE WINDU
Then the Jedi Council will make finding Grievous our highest priority.
"BAIL, ANAKIN, and the crowd walk away from the platform toward"
the Senate Building Grand Hallway.
BAIL ORGANA
"Skywalker, the Republic cannot praise you enough."
"ANAKIN and BAIL ORGANA, walking in the hallway."
ANAKIN
"Thank you, Senator Organa. The kidnapping was a bold move by the"
"Separatists, but it was a mistake that Obi-Wan and I were able to"
take advantage of.
ARTOO and THREEPIO follow behind the crowd.
C-3PO
It couldn’t possibly be as bad as all that.
ARTOO beeps.
C-3PO
"(continuing) Well, there, I agree with you. In fact, I could do with a"
tune-up myself.
70 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN
HALLWAY-LATE AFTERNOON
"ANAKIN is at the back of the crowd of SENATORS, talking with BAIL"
ORGANA. R2-D2 and C-3PO scoot along ahead of them.
BAIL ORGANA
"The end of Count Dooku will surely bring an end to this war, and an"
end to the Chancellor’s draconian security measures.
ANAKIN
"I wish that were so, but the fighting is going to continue until General"
Grievous is spare parts . . . The Chancellor is very clear about that.
"Behind a row of large columns, a SHADOWY FIGURE follows the"
JEDI and the SENATOR. ANAKIN senses the figure.
BAIL ORGANA
I’ll do everything I can with the Senate.
ANAKIN
Excuse me.
BAIL ORGANA
Certainly.
"ANAKIN stops, and BAIL goes off after PALPATINE and the others."
ANAKIN goes behind one of the giant columns to meet up with the
"SHADOWY FIGURE, who is revealed to be SENATOR PADME"
AMDALA. They embrace and kiss.
PADME
"Oh, Anakin! Thank goodness, you’re back."
ANAKIN
"I missed you, Padme. I’ve missed you so."
PADME
There were whispers . . . that you’d been killed. I’ve been living with
unbearable dread.
ANAKIN
"I’m back, I’m all right. It feels like we’ve been apart for a lifetime. And"
it might have been … If the Chancellor hadn’t been kidnapped. I don’t
think they would have ever brought us back from the Outer Rim
sieges.
ANAKIN starts to give her another kiss. She steps back.
PADME
"Wait, not here . . ."
He grabs her again.
ANAKIN
"Yes, here! I’m tired of all this deception. I don’t care if they know"
we’re married.
PADME
"Anakin, don’t say things like that. You’re important to the Republic …"
"to ending this war. I love you more than anything, but I won’t let you"
give up your life as a Jedi for me . . .
ANAKIN
"I’ve given my life to the Jedi order, but I’d only give up my life, for you."
PADME
"(playfully) I wouldn’t like that. I wouldn’t like that one bit. Patience, my"
handsome Jedi . . . Come to me later.
"ANAKIN embraces her, then looks at her."
ANAKIN
Are you all right? You’re trembling. What’s going on?
PADME
I’m just excited to see you.
ANAKIN
That’s not it. I sense more . . . what is it?
PADME
Nothing . . . nothing . . .
ANAKIN
You’re frightened. (a little angry) Tell me what’s going on!
PADME begins to cry.
PADME
You’ve been gone five months . . . it’s been very hard for me. I’ve
never felt so alone. There’s . . .
ANAKIN
. . . Is there someone else?
PADME
"(peeved, angry) No! Why do you think that? Your jealousy upsets me"
"so much, Anakin. I do nothing to betray you, yet you still don’t trust"
me. Nothing has changed.
ANAKIN
"(sheepish) I’m afraid of losing you, Padme . . . that’s all."
PADME
"I will never stop loving you, Anakin. My only fear is losing you."
ANAKIN
It’s just that I’ve never seen you like this . . .
PADME
Something wonderful has happened.
They look at each other for a long moment.
PADME
"(continuing) I’m . . . Annie, I’m pregnant."
ANAKIN is stunned. He thinks through all of the ramifications of this.
He takes her in his arms.
ANAKIN
That’s . . . that’s wonderful.
PADME
What are we going to do?
ANAKIN
"We’re not going to worry about anything right now, all right? This is a"
happy moment. The happiest moment of my life.
71 EXT. UTAPAU-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY
A small NEIMOIDIAN SHUTTLE lands. BATTLE DROIDS surround
the ramp as GENERAL GRIEVOUS descends onto the platform.
SUPER BATTLE DROID G21 approaches.
SUPER BATTLE DROID G21
"The planet is secure, sir. The population is under control."
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
Good. Where is the Separatist Council?
SUPER BATTLE DROID G21
"This way, sir …"
GENERAL GRIEVOUS takes the elevator to an upper level. He
enters a conference room and presses a series of buttons on the
"table, and bows."
72 INT. UTAPAU-CONFERENCE ROOM-GRAND CHAMBER-DAY
A hologram of Darth Sidious appears.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
"Yes, Lord Sidious."
DARTH SlDIOUS
"General Grievous, I suggest you move the Separatist leaders to"
Mustafar.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
"It will be done, My Lord."
DARTH SlDIOUS
"The end of the war is near, General, and I promise you, victory is"
assured.
The hologram of Sidious talks to GRIEVOUS about the death of
Count Dooku.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
But the loss of Count Dooku?
DARTH SlDIOUS
"His death was a necessary loss, which will ensure our victory. Soon I"
will have a new apprentice . . . one far younger and more powerful
than Lord Tyranus.
73 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME’S APARTMENT-TWILIGHT
PADME stands in the balcony brushing her hair. ANAKIN leans
"against the wall, watching her lovingly."
ANAKIN
". . . every second I was thinking of you. Protecting the endless,"
nameless Outer Rim settlements became a torture . . . the battles
"were easy, the longing became unbearable . . . I’ve never been so"
happy as I am at this moment.
PADME
"Annie, I want to have our baby back home on Naboo. We could go to"
the lake country where no one would know . . . where we would be
safe. I could go early-and fix up the baby’s room. I know the perfect
"spot, right by the gardens."
ANAKIN
You are so beautiful!
PADME
It’s only because I’m so in love . . .
ANAKIN
"No, it’s because I’m so in love with you."
PADME
So love has blinded you?
ANAKIN
"Well, that’s not exactly what I meant . . ."
PADME
But it’s probably true!
They laugh.
ANAKIN
I haven’t laughed in so long . . .
PADME
Neither have I.
74 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-DREAM
The view is strangely distorted and disorienting. PADME is on a table
in an alien medical chamber. She is giving birth and is screaming.
PADME
"Anakin, help me! Help, Anakin! Anakin, I love you. I love you."
She screams and dies.
75 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME’S APARTMENT-BEDROOM-NIGHT
ANAKIN awakens in a panic. He is covered in sweat. He looks over in
the bed and sees PADME sound asleep next to him. ANAKIN gets
out from under the sheets and sits on the side of the bed. He is
breathing heavily. He puts his head in his hands and weeps. He
regains his composure and leaves the room down a set of stairs.
"PADME awakens, realizes Anakin is gone."
PADME
Anakin??
She gets out of bed and goes downstairs to look for him.
76 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME’S APARTMENT-VERANDA-NIGHT
ANAKIN walks down a flight of stairs onto a large veranda. The vast
"city planet of Coruscant, smoldering from the battle, is spread out"
before him. He is distraught.
PADME descends the stairs and joins ANAKIN on the veranda. She
takes his hand. He doesn’t look at her.
PADME
What’s bothering you?
ANAKIN
Nothing . . .
"ANAKIN touches the japor snippet around PADME’S neck, that"
Anakin gave her when he was a small boy.
ANAKIN
(continuing) I remember when I gave this to you.
PADME
"Anakin, how long is it going to take for us to be honest with each"
other?
ANAKIN
It was a dream.
PADME
Bad?
ANAKIN
Like the ones I used to have about my mother just before she died.
PADME
And?
ANAKIN
It was about you.
They look at each other. A moment of concern passes between them.
PADME
Tell me.
ANAKIN
It was only a dream.
"PADME gives him a long, worried look. ANAKIN takes a deep breath."
ANAKIN
(continuing) You die in childbirth . . .
PADME
And the baby?
ANAKIN
I don’t know.
PADME
It was only a dream.
ANAKIN takes PADME in his arms.
ANAKIN
". . . I won’t let this one become real, Padme."
"They embrace, then part."
PADME
"Anakin, this baby will change our lives. I doubt the Queen will"
"continue to allow me to serve in the Senate, and if the Council"
"discovers you are the father, you will be expelled from the Jedi Order."
ANAKIN
I know ….
PADME
"Anakin, do you think Obi-Wan might be able to help us?"
ANAKIN
(suspicious) Have you told him anything?
PADME
"No, but he’s your mentor, your best friend . . . he must suspect"
something.
ANAKIN
"He’s been a father to me, but he’s still on the Council. Don’t tell him"
anything!
PADME
"I won’t, Anakin."
ANAKIN
"I don’t need his help . . . Our baby is a blessing, not a problem."
77 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-YODAS QUARTERS-DAY
"YODA and ANAKIN sit in Yoda ‘s room, deep in thought."
YODA
Premonitions . . . premonitions . . . Hmmmm . . . these visions you
have . . .
ANAKIN
"They are of pain, suffering, death . . ."
YODA
"Yourself you speak of, or someone you know?"
ANAKIN
Someone . . .
YODA
. . . close to you?
ANAKIN
Yes.
YODA
"Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin. The fear of"
loss is a path to the dark side.
ANAKIN
"I won’t let these visions come true, Master Yoda."
YODA
Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who
"transform into the Force. Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not."
"Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed, that is."
ANAKIN
"What must I do, Master Yoda?"
YODA
Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.
78 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-HALLWAY-DAY
"ANAKIN hurries down a temple hallway, heading toward a Jedi"
Briefing Room. SEVERAL JEDI are exiting.
79 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-BRIEFING ROOM-DAY
ANAKIN rushes into the Briefing Room. By the time he reaches the
"Chamber, the last of the Jedi are leaving. Only OBI-WAN remains at"
the front of the lecture hall. He is shutting off some holograms and
electronic charts and maps.
OBI-WAN
You missed the report on the Outer Rim sieges.
ANAKIN
"I’m sorry, I was held up. I have no excuse."
OBI-WAN
"In short, they are going very well. Saleucami has fallen, and Master"
Vos has moved his troops to Boz Pity.
ANAKIN
What’s wrong then?
OBI-WAN
The Senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the
Chancellor today.
ANAKIN
"Well, that can only mean less deliberating and more action. Is that"
bad? It will make it easier for us to end this war.
OBI-WAN
"Anakin, be careful of your friend Palpatine."
ANAKIN
Be careful of what?
OBI-WAN
He has requested your presence.
ANAKIN
What for?
OBI-WAN
He would not say.
ANAKIN
"He didn’t inform the Jedi Council? That’s unusual, isn’t it?"
OBI-WAN
"All of this is unusual, and it’s making me feel uneasy. You’re probably"
aware that relations between the Council and the Chancellor are
stressed.
ANAKIN
"I know the Council has grown wary of the Chancellor’s power, mine"
also for that matter. Aren’t we all working together to save the
Republic? Why all this distrust?
OBI-WAN
"The Force grows dark, Anakin, and we are all affected by it. Be wary"
of your feelings.
80 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR’S OFFICE-DAY
ANAKIN stands with PALPATINE at his window overlooking the
vastness of Coruscant. Several buildings have been destroyed. A
brown haze hangs over the landscape.
PALPATINE
"Anakin, this afternoon the Senate is going to call on me to take direct"
control of the Jedi Council.
ANAKIN
The Jedi will no longer report to the Senate?
PALPATINE
They will report to me . . . personally. The Senate is too unfocused to
conduct a war. This will bring a quick end to things.
ANAKIN
"I agree, but the Jedi Council may not see it that way."
PALPATINE
There are times when we must all endure adjustments to the
constitution in the name of security.
ANAKIN
"With all due respect, sir, the Council is in no mood for more"
constitutional amendments.
PALPATINE
"Thank you, my friend, but in this case I have no choice . . . this war"
must be won.
ANAKIN
Everyone will agree on that.
PALPATINE
"Anakin, I’ve known you since you were a small boy. I have advised"
you over the years when I could … I am very proud of your
accomplishments. You have won many battles the Jedi Council
"thought were lost . . . and you saved my life. I hope you trust me,"
Anakin.
ANAKIN
Of course.
PALPATINE
"I need your help, son."
ANAKIN
What do you mean?
PALPATINE
I fear the Jedi. The Council keeps pushing for more control. They’re
shrouded in secrecy and obsessed with maintaining their autonomy .
. . ideals. I find simply incomprehensible in a democracy.
ANAKIN
I can assure you that the Jedi are dedicated to the values of the
"Republic, sir."
PALPATINE
"Nevertheless, their actions will speak more loudly than their words."
I’m depending on you.
ANAKIN
For what? I don’t understand.
PALPATINE
"To be the eyes, ears, and voice of the Republic . . ."
ANAKIN thinks about this.
PALPATINE
(continuing) Anakin . . . I’m appointing you to be my personal
representative on the Jedi Council.
ANAKIN
"Me? A Master? I am overwhelmed, sir, but the Council elects its own"
members. They will never accept this.
PALPATINE
I think they will . . . they need you more than you know.
81 INT. CORUSCANT-BAIL ORGANA’S OFFICE-DAY
"PADME, BAIL ORGANA, and SENATORS MON MOTHMA, FANG"
"ZAR, TERR TANEEL, and GIDDEAN DANU sit in Senator Organa ‘s"
office.
BAIL ORGANA
"Now that he has control of the Jedi Council, the Chancellor has"
appointed Governors to oversee all star systems in the Republic.
FANG ZAR
When did this happen?
BAIL ORGANA
The decree was posted this morning.
PADME
Do you think he will dismantle the Senate?
MON MOTHMA
"Why bother? As a practical matter, the Senate no longer exists."
GIDDEAN DANU
The constitution is in shreds. Amendment after amendment . . .
"executive directives, sometimes a dozen in one day."
BAIL ORGANA
We can’t let a thousand years of democracy disappear without a fight.
"EVERYONE looks at each other, a little worried at the implications of"
what was just said.
TERR TANEEL
What are you suggesting?
BAIL ORGANA
I apologize. I didn’t mean to sound like a Separatist.
MON MOTHMA
"We are not Separatists trying to leave the Republic. We are loyalists,"
trying to preserve democracy in the Republic.
BAIL ORGANA
It has become increasingly clear to many of us that the Chancellor
has become an enemy of democracy.
PADME
I can’t believe it has come to this! Chancellor Palpatine is one of my
oldest advisors. He served as my Ambassador when I was Queen.
GlDDEAN DANU
"Senator, I fear you underestimate the amount of corruption that has"
taken hold in the Senate.
MON MOTHMA
The Chancellor has played the Senators well. They know where the
"power lies, and they will do whatever it takes to share in it. Palpatine"
has become a dictator and we have helped him to do it.
BAIL ORGANA
"We can’t sit around debating any longer, we have decided to do what"
we can to stop it. Senator Mon Mothma and I are putting together an
organization . . .
PADME
"Say no more. Senator Organa. I understand. At this point, it’s better"
to leave some things unsaid.
BAIL ORGANA
"Yes. I agree and we must not discuss this with anyone, without"
everyone in this group agreeing.
MON MOTHMA
That means those closest to you . . . even family … no one can be
told.
They ALL nod their heads. PADME considers this for a moment.
PADME
Agreed.
82 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-HALLWAY OUTSIDE
COUNCIL CHAMBERS-DAY
ANAKIN stands pensively in front of the Jedi Council Chambers. The
door opens.
83 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-COUNCIL CHAMBERS-DAY
ANAKIN enters and stands in the middle of the room. He is
"surrounded by the Jedi Council MACE WINDU, EETH KOTH OBIWAN,"
"YODA, the HOLOGRAMS of PLO KOON and KI-ADI-MUNDI."
MACE
"Anakin Skywalker, we have approved your appointment to the"
Council as the Chancellor’s personal representative.
ANAKIN
I will do my best to uphold the principles of the Jedi Order.
YODA
"Allow this appointment lightly, the Council does not. Disturbing is this"
move by Chancellor Palpatine.
ANAKIN
I understand.
MACE
"You are on this Council, but we do not grant you the rank of Master."
Anakin reacts with anger.
ANAKIN
"What? ! How can you do this?? This is outrageous, it’s unfair . . . I’m"
more powerful than any of you. How can you be on the Council and
not be a Master?
MACE
"Take a seat, young Skywalker."
ANAKIN
"Forgive me, Master."
ANAKIN goes and sits in one of the empty chairs. Everyone is
"embarrassed. KI-ADI-MUNDI WHO APPEARS AS A HOLOGRAM,"
speaks.
Kl-ADI-MUNDI
"We have surveyed all systems in the Republic, and have found no"
sign of General Grievous.
YODA
"Hiding in the Outer Rim, Grievous is. The outlying systems, you must"
sweep.
OBI-WAN
It may take some time . . . we do not have many ships to spare.
MACE
We cannot take ships from the front line.
OBI-WAN
"And yet, it would be fatal for us to allow the droid armies to regroup."
YODA
"Master Kenobi, our spies contact, you must, and then wait."
Kl-ADI-MUNDI
What about the droid attack on the Wookiees?
MACE
"It is critical we send an attack group there, immediately!"
OBI-WAN
"He’s right, that is a system we cannot afford to lose. It’s the main"
navigation route for the southwestern quadrant.
ANAKIN
I know that system well. It would take us little time to drive the droids
off that planet.
MACE
"Skywalker, your assignment is here with the Chancellor, and Kenobi"
must find General Grievous.
YODA
"Go, I will. Good relations with the Wookiees, I have."
MACE
It is settled then. Yoda will take a battalion of clones to reinforce the
Wookiees on Kashyyyk. May the Force be with us all.
ANAKIN is disappointed.
84 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-MASSIVE MAIN HALLWAY
AND ALCOVE-LATE AFTERNOON
ANAKIN and OBI-WAN walk through one of the massive Jedi Temple
hallways. ANAKIN is furious.
ANAKIN
"What kind of nonsense is this, put me on the Council and not make"
me a Master!?? That’s never been done in the history of the Jedi. It’s
insulting!
OBI-WAN
"Calm down, Anakin. You have been given a great honor. To be on"
"the Council at your age . . . It’s never happened before. Listen to me,"
Anakin. The fact of the matter is you’re too close to the Chancellor.
The Council doesn’t like it when he interferes in Jedi affairs.
ANAKIN
"I swear to you, I didn’t ask to be put on the Council . . ."
OBI-WAN
But it’s what you wanted! Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine
seems to have paid off.
ANAKIN
That has nothing to do with this.
OBI-WAN
"Anakin, regardless of how it happened, you find yourself in a delicate"
situation.
ANAKIN
You mean divided loyalties.
OBI-WAN
I warned you there was tension between the Council and the
Chancellor. I was very clear. Why didn’t you listen? You walked right
into it.
ANAKIN
The Council is upset I’m the youngest to ever serve.
OBI-WAN
"No, it is not. Anakin, I worry when you speak of jealousy and pride."
"Those are not Jedi thoughts. They’re dangerous, dark thoughts."
ANAKIN
"Master, you of all people should have confidence in my abilities. I"
know where my loyalties lie.
OBI-WAN
I hope so . . .
ANAKIN
I sense there’s more to this talk than you’re saying.
OBI-WAN
"Anakin, the only reason the Council has approved your appointment"
is because the Chancellor trusts you.
ANAKIN
And?
OBI-WAN
"Anakin, look, I am on your side. I didn’t want to see you put in this"
situation.
ANAKIN
What situation?
OBI-WAN
(takes a deep breath) The Council wants you to report on all of the
Chancellor’s dealings. They want to know what he’s up to.
ANAKIN
They want me to spy on the Chancellor? That’s treason!
OBI-WAN
"We are at war, Anakin. The Jedi Council is sworn to uphold the"
"principles of the Republic, even if the Chancellor does not."
ANAKIN
Why didn’t the Council give me this assignment when we were in
session?
OBI-WAN
This assignment is not to be on record. The Council asked me to
approach you on this personally.
ANAKIN
"The Chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan. He befriended me. He’s"
watched out for me ever since I arrived here.
OBI-WAN
"That is why you must help us, Anakin. Our allegiance is to the"
"Senate, not to its leader who has managed to stay in office long after"
his term has expired.
ANAKIN
"Master, the Senate demanded that he stay longer."
OBI-WAN
"Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin. Something is out of place."
ANAKIN
You’re asking me to do something against the Jedi Code. Against the
Republic. Against a mentor . . . and a friend. That’s what’s out of
place here. Why are you asking this of me?
OBI-WAN
The Council is asking you.
85 EXT. CORUSCANT-CLONE LANDING PLATFORM-DAY
A JEDI GUNSHIP heads for the huge Clone landing platform.
86 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI GUNSHIP-DAY
"YODA, MACE, and OBI-WAN ride in the GUNSHIP as it heads for"
the Clone landing platform. Mace and Obi-Wan are sitting.
OBI-WAN
Anakin did not take to his assignment with much enthusiasm.
YODA
"Too much under the sway of the Chancellor, he is. Much anger there"
is in him. Too much pride in his powers.
MACE
"It’s very dangerous, putting them together. I don’t think the boy can"
handle it. I don’t trust him.
OBI-WAN
He’ll be all right. I trust him with my life.
MACE
I wish I did.
OBI-WAN
"With all due respect, Master, is he not the Chosen One? Is he not to"
destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force?
MACE
So the prophecy says.
YODA
A prophecy . . . that misread could have been.
OBI-WAN
He will not let me down. He never has.
YODA
"I hope right you are. And now destroy the Droid armies on Kashyyyk,"
I will. May the Force be with you.
The GUNSHIP lands and the ramp lowers. YODA exits the
GUNSHIP. MACE and OBI-WAN stand and give him a brief bow then
take off in the GUNSHIP.
87 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME’S APARTMENT-VERANDASUNSET
Padme’s Speeder pulls up to the landing platform. CAPTAIN TYPHO
"escorts PADME onto the veranda, where TWO HANDMAIDENS"
(ELLE and MOTEE) are waiting. PADME turns to CAPTAIN TYPHO.
PADME
"Thank you, Captain."
CAPTAIN TYPHO
Rest well. My Lady.
"CAPTAIN TYPHO gets back into the Speeder, and it disappears into"
"the cityscape. The HANDMAIDENS, Motee and Elle, approach"
PADME as the SHADOW OF A FIGURE moves in the background.
C-3PO is standing nearby.
PADME
I’ll be up in a while.
MOTEE
"Yes, my lady."
"C-3PO stands, confused, as the HANDMAIDENS turn and exit."
C-3PO
"Is there anything I might do for you, my lady?"
PADME
"Yes, make sure all the security droids are working. Thank you,"
Threepio.
The golden droid turns and exits.
PADME stands and watches the sunset. The SHADOWY FIGURE
moves toward her. She senses something.
ANAKIN
"Beautiful, isn’t it?"
PADME jumps and turns around.
PADME
You startled me.
He sits next to her on the bench.
ANAKIN
How are you feeling?
PADME
He keeps kicking.
ANAKIN
He?! Why do you think it’s a boy?
PADME
(laughs) My motherly intuition.
She puts his hand on her belly.
ANAKIN
"Whoa! With a kick that strong, it’s got to be a girl."
They laugh.
PADME
I heard about your appointment. Anakin. I’m so proud of you.
ANAKIN
"I may be on the Council, but . . . they refused to accept me as a Jedi"
Master.
PADME
"Patience. In time, they will recognize your skills."
ANAKIN
They still treat me as if I were a Padawan learner. . . they fear my
"power, that’s the problem."
PADME
Anakin . . .
ANAKIN
"Sometimes, I wonder what’s happening to the Jedi Order . . . I think"
this war is destroying the principles of the Republic.
PADME
Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side?
ANAKIN
(suspicious) What do you mean?
PADME
"What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists,"
and the Republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to
destroy?
ANAKIN
I don’t believe that. And you’re sounding like a Separatist!
PADME
"Anakin, this war represents a failure to listen . . . Now, you’re closer"
"to the Chancellor than anyone. Please, please ask him to stop the"
fighting and let diplomacy resume.
ANAKIN
"(growing angry) Don’t ask me to do that, Padme. Make a motion in"
"the Senate, where that kind of a request belongs. I’m not your errand"
boy. I’m not anyone’s errand boy!
PADME
What is it?
ANAKIN
Nothing.
PADME
Don’t do this . . . don’t shut me out. Let me help you.
ANAKIN
You can’t help me . . . I’m trying to help you.
They look in each other’s eyes.
ANAKIN
(continuing) I sense . . . there are things you are not telling me.
PADME is startled at this.
PADME
I sense there are things you are not telling me.
PADME smiles. ANAKIN is a little embarrassed.
PADME
"(continuing) Hold me . . . like you did by the lake on Naboo, so long"
"ago . . . when there was nothing but our love … No politics, no"
plotting … no war.
88 INT. CORUSCANT-GALAXIES OPERA HOUSE-NIGHT
ANAKIN lands his speeder and exits.
ANAKIN runs up the stairs at the Galaxies Opera House.
"ANAKIN runs through the hallway and enters Palpatine’s box, where"
"the CHANCELLOR is sitting with Mas Amedda and Sly-Moore,"
watching the Man Calamari Ballet doing “Squid Lake.”
ANAKIN
"You wanted to see me, Chancellor."
PALPATINE
"Yes, Anakin! Come closer. I have good news. Our Clone Intelligence"
Units have discovered the location of General Grievous. He is hiding
in the Utapau system.
ANAKIN
"At last, we’ll be able to capture that monster and end this war."
PALPATINE
I would worry about the collective wisdom of the Council if they didn’t
"select you for this assignment. You are the best choice by far … but,"
they can’t always be trusted to do the right thing.
ANAKIN
They try.
PALPATINE
"Sit down, (to his aides) Leave us."
ANAKIN sits next to PALPATINE. The Chancellor leans over to him.
PALPATINE
"(continuing) Anakin, you know I’m not able to rely on the Jedi Council."
"If they haven’t included you in their plot, they soon will."
ANAKIN
I’m not sure I understand.
PALPATINE
You must sense what I have come to suspect . . . the Jedi Council
want control of the Republic . . . they’re planning to betray me.
ANAKIN
I don’t think . . .
PALPATINE
"Anakin, search your feelings. You know, don’t you?"
ANAKIN
I know they don’t trust you . . .
PALPATINE
Or the Senate . . . or the Republic . . . or democracy for that matter.
ANAKIN
I have to admit my trust in them has been shaken.
PALPATINE
"Why? They asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest,"
didn’t they?
ANAKIN doesn’t say anything. He simply looks down.
PALPATINE
"(continuing) They asked you to spy on me, didn’t they?"
ANAKIN
I don’t know … I don’t know what to say.
PALPATINE
Remember back to your early teachings. Anakin. “All those who gain
power are afraid to lose it.” Even the Jedi.
ANAKIN
The Jedi use their power for good.
PALPATINE
"Good is a point of view, Anakin. And the Jedi point of view is not the"
only valid one. The Dark Lords of the Sith believe in security and
"justice also, yet they are considered by the Jedi to be. . ."
ANAKIN
. . . evil.
PALPATINE
. . . from a Jedi’s point of view. The Sith and the Jedi are similar in
"almost every way, including their quest for greater power. The"
difference between the two is the Sith are not afraid of the dark side
of the Force. That is why they are more powerful.
ANAKIN
"The Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inward,"
only about themselves.
PALPATINE
And the Jedi don’t?
ANAKIN
The Jedi are selfless . . . they only care about others.
PALPATINE smiles.
PALPATINE
"Or so you’ve been trained to believe. Why is it, then, that they have"
asked you to do something you feel is wrong?
ANAKIN
I’m not sure it’s wrong.
PALPATINE
Have they asked you to betray the Jedi code? The Constitution? A
friendship? Your own values? Think. Consider their motives. Keep
your mind clear of assumptions. The fear of losing power is a
weakness of both the Jedi and the Sith.
ANAKIN is deep in thought.
PALPATINE
(continuing) Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis “the
wise”?
ANAKIN
No.
PALPATINE
I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend.
"Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise"
he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life …
He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep
the ones he cared about from dying.
ANAKIN
He could actually save people from death?
PALPATINE
The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some
consider to be unnatural.
ANAKIN
What happened to him?
PALPATINE
He became so powerful . . . the only thing he was afraid of was losing
"his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he"
"taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed"
him in his sleep. (smiles) Plagueis never saw it coming. It’s ironic he
"could save others from death, but not himself."
ANAKIN
Is it possible to learn this power?
PALPATINE
Not from a Jedi.
89 EXT. KASHYYYK-DAY
A WOOKIEE CATAMARAN flanked by WOOKIEE HELICOPTERS
approaches the tree housing the HOLOGRAM AREA.
90 INT. KASHYYYK-HOLOGRAM AREA-DAY
YODA and various JEDI speak via hologram. The discussion includes
"OBI-WAN, MACE, AGEN KOLAR, YODA- KI-ADI-MUNDI and PLO"
KOON.
Kl-ADI-MUNDI
(holo) Palpatine thinks General Grievous is on Utapau. We have had
no reports of this from our agents.
MACE
(holo) How could the Chancellor have come by this information and
we know nothing about it? We have had contact with Baron
Papanoida and he said no one was there.
ANAKIN
A partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet from the
Chairman of Utapau.
YODA
"Act on this, we must. The capture of General Grievous will end this"
war. Quickly and decisively we should proceed.
OBI-WAN
Does everyone agree?
All the JEDI concur.
ANAKIN
The Chancellor has requested that I lead the campaign.
They all look at ANAKIN a bit disturbed.
MACE
"(a little peeved) The Council will make up its own mind who is to go,"
not the Chancellor.
Kl-ADI-MUNDI
"Yes, this decision is ours to make."
ANAKIN is embarrassed and becomes sullen.
YODA
"A Master is needed, with more experience."
MACE
"Given our resources, I recommend we send only one Jedi . . . Master"
Kenobi.
ANAKIN
He was not so successful the last time he met Grievous.
OBI-WAN throws ANAKIN a dirty look.
ANAKIN
"(continuing) No offense, my Master, but I’m only stating a fact."
OBI-WAN
"Oh no, you’re quite right, but I do have the most experience with his"
ways of combat.
YODA
"Obi-Wan, my choice is."
Kl-ADI-MUNDI
I concur. Master Kenobi should go.
YODA
I agree.
All the JEDI concur.
MACE
Very well. Council is adjourned.
ANAKIN is angry.
MACE
"(continuing) Obi-Wan, prepare two clone brigades as quickly as you"
"can. If this report is true, there’s no telling how many battle droids he"
may have with him.
91 INT. KASHYYYK-HOLOGRAM AREA-DAY
YODA gets out of his chair and walks to the edge of the platform.
CLONE COMMANDER GREE
The droids have started up their main power generators.
YODA
"Then now the time is, Commander."
CLONE COMMANDER GREE
"Yes, sir."
The battle begins.
92 EXT. KASHYYYK-BEACH HEAD-DAY
A WOOKIEE CHIEFTAIN lets out a roar as the Wookiee army rushes
to face the DROID ARMY. CORPORATE ALLIANCE TANK DROIDS
race across the water against the WOOKIEES and CLONE
"TROOPERS on the beach. DROID GUNSHIPS provide air support,"
while a SPIDER DROID emerges from the watery depths. A brave
WOOKIEE places an explosive on a SEPARATIST TANK and jumps
"off just before the TANK EXPLODES. From the Hologram Area, Yoda"
observes the ongoing battle.
93 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME’S APARTMENT-EARLY MORNING
Padme’s apartment building is surrounded by the smog-shrouded city
of Coruscant.
94 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME’S APARTMENT-LIVING ROOMEARLY
MORNING
PADME and OBI-WAN sit on one of the couches.
OBI-WAN
Has Anakin been to see you?
PADME
Several times . . . I was so happy to hear he was accepted on the
Jedi Council.
OBI-WAN
"I know … he deserves it. He is impatient, strong willed, very"
"opinionated, but truly gifted."
They laugh.
PADME
"You’re not just here to say hello. Something is wrong, isn’t it?"
OBI-WAN
"You should be a Jedi, Padme."
PADME
You’re not very good at hiding your feelings.
OBI-WAN
It’s Anakin . . . He’s becoming moody and detached. He’s been put in
a difficult position as the Chancellor’s representative . . . but I think it’s
more than that. I was hoping he may have talked to you.
PADME
Why would he talk to me about his work?
OBI-WAN studies her.
OBI-WAN
Neither of you is very good at hiding your feelings either.
PADME
Don’t give me that look.
OBI-WAN
I know how he feels about you.
PADME
(nervous) What did he say?
OBI-WAN
Nothing. He didn’t have to.
PADME is a little flustered. She stands and Obi-Wan follows. She
walks to the balcony.
PADME
I don’t know what you’re talking about.
OBI-WAN
"I know you both too well. I can see you two are in love. Padme, I’m"
worried about him.
PADME looks down and doesn’t answer.
OBI-WAN
(continuing) I fear your relationship has confused him. He’s changed
considerably since we returned . . .
They stand on the balcony and look off at the early morning city. OBIWAN
starts to leave. PADME stays looking off into the distant city.
OBI-WAN
"(continuing) Padme, I’m not telling the Council about any of this. I … I"
"hope I didn’t upset you. We’re all friends, I care about both of you . . ."
PADME
"Thank you, Obi-Wan."
OBI-WAN
Please do what you can to help him.
95 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME’S APARTMENT-DAY
"PADME, MON MOTHMA, and five other Senators (BANA BREEMU,"
"FANG ZAR. CHI EEKWAY, GIDDEAN DANU, BAIL ORGANA) sit in"
Padme’s living room. C-3PO serves drinks to the guests.
PADME
We cannot let this turn into another war.
BAIL ORGANA
"Absolutely, that is the last thing we want."
MON MOTHMA
We are hoping to form an alliance in the Senate to stop the
"Chancellor from further subverting the constitution, that’s all."
PADME
I know a Jedi I feel it would be wise to consult.
BANA BREEMU
That would be dangerous.
MON MOTHMA
We don’t know where the Jedi stand in all this.
PADME
I only wish to discuss this with one . . . one I trust.
GiDDEAN DANU
Going against the Chancellor without the support of the Jedi is risky.
PADME
The Jedi aren’t any happier with the situation than we are . . .
CHI EEKWAY
"Patience, Senator."
FANG ZAR
"We have so many Senators on our side, surely that will pursuade the"
Chancellor.
BANA BREEMU
When you present the “petition of the two thousand” to the
"Chancellor, things may change."
BAIL ORGANA
"Let us see what we can accomplish in the Senate, before we include"
the Jedi.
PADME takes a deep breath in frustration and disappointment.
96 EXT. CORUSCANT-CLONE LANDING PLATFORM-DAY
ANAKIN and OBI-WAN walk onto a landing platform overlooking a
docking bay where THOUSANDS OF CLONE TROOPS and armored
"weapons, tanks, etc., are being loaded onto a massive REPUBLIC"
ASSAULT SHIP.
ANAKIN
"You’re going to need me on this one, Master."
OBI-WAN
"Oh, I agree. However it may turn out just to be a wild bantha chase."
OBI-WAN starts to turn and leave.
ANAKIN
Master!
OBI-WAN stops and ANAKIN walks over to him.
ANAKIN
"(continuing) Master, I’ve disappointed you. I have not been very"
appreciative of your training . . . I have been arrogant and I apologize
. . . I’ve just been so frustrated with the Council. Your friendship
means everything to me.
OBI-WAN
"You are strong and wise, Anakin, and I am very proud of you. I have"
trained you since you were a small boy. I have taught you everything
I know. And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever
"hope to be, and you have saved my life more times than I can"
"remember. But be patient, Anakin. It won’t be long before the Council"
makes you a Jedi Master.
"OBI-WAN starts down the ramp, then turns back."
OBI-WAN
(continuing) Don’t worry. I have enough clones with me to take three
systems the size of Utapau. I think I’ll be able to handle the situation .
. . even without your help.
ANAKIN
"Well, there’s always a first time."
OBI-WAN laughs.
They talk for a few more minutes before ANAKIN watches OBI-WAN
depart.
ANAKIN
"Obi-Wan, may the Force be with you."
OBI-WAN
"Good-bye, old friend. May the Force be with you."
OBI-WAN heads down a ramp toward the waiting Republic cruiser.
97 EXT. CORUSCANT-CLONE LANDING PLATFORM-DAY
The Republic cruiser lifts off and heads for space.
98 INT. REPUBLIC BATTLE CRUISER-HANGAR-SPACE
CLONE TROOPERS stand at attention in rows on the floor of the
"hangar deck, waiting to board landing craft. OBI-WAN stands next to"
his BLUE JEDI FIGHTER- talking to SEVERAL CLONE
COMMANDERS with their helmets off. A hologram of the planet
Utapau is projected by R4-G9 into the middle of the hangar.
CLONE COMMANDER CODY
"Fortunately, most of the cities are concentrated on this small"
continent here . . . on the far side.
OBI-WAN
I’ll keep them distracted until you get there. Just don’t take too long.
CLONE COMMANDER CODY
"Come on, boss, when have I ever let you down?"
They laugh.
OBI-WAN
(laughing) Cato Nemoidia . . . for starters.
OBI-WAN climbs into his Jedi Fighter.
CLONE COMMANDER CODY
That was Anakin who was late. I believe.
OBI-WAN
"Very well, the burden is on me not to destroy all the droids before you"
get there.
CLONE COMMANDER CODY
I’m counting on you.
99 EXT. JEDI FIGHTER-SPACE
OBI-WAN blasts the BLUE JEDI FIGHTER out of the Republic Battle
Cruiser and into the hyperspace ring. He heads for the planet Utapau.
100 EXT. CORUSCANT-CITYSCAPE-CHANCELLOR’S
TRANSPORT-DAY
The Chancellor’s Transport races through the city and heads for the
Senate Office Building landing platform. Waiting on the landing
"platform is a LONE JEDI. The Transport lands, and CHANCELLOR"
PALPATINE emerges with FOUR ROYAL GUARDS and MAS
AMEDDA. The FOUR ROYAL GUARDS move off in another direction
"as PALPATINE greets ANAKIN, who has been waiting for him."
PALPATINE
"Well, Anakin, did you see your friend off?"
ANAKIN
He will soon have Grievous’s head.
PALPATINE
We can only hope the Council didn’t make a mistake.
ANAKIN
The Council was very sure in its decision.
They exit the landing platform.
101 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN
HALLWAY-DAY
They enter the main hallway of the Senate Office Building. They pass
"SEVERAL SENATORS, including REPRESENTATIVE JAR JAR"
BINKS from Naboo.
JAR JAR
Helloo Annie. Good en to see yousa . . .
The Gungan waves to Anakin.
ANAKIN
"Hi, Jar Jar."
JAR JAR
"Oopsin da Chancellor!! So sorry, Your Highness, sir."
Anakin turns back to the Chancellor.
PALPATINE
There are rumors in the Senate about Master Kenobi. Many believe
he is not fit for this assignment.
ANAKIN
Not fit? Why would anyone think that?
PALPATINE
They say his mind has become fogged by the influence of a certain
female Senator.
ANAKIN
That’s ridiculous. Who?!?
PALPATINE
(slyly) No one knows who she is … only that she is a Senator.
ANAKIN
That’s impossible. I would know.
PALPATINE
Sometimes the closest are the ones who cannot see.
ANAKIN becomes worried.
PALPATINE
(continuing) Idle Senate gossip is rarely true and never accurate. I’m
sure your Master will do fine.
102 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-DREAM
PADME calls out in pain. OBI-WAN is near her and softly speaks to
her.
OBI-WAN
Save your energy.
PADME
I can’t!
OBI-WAN
"Don’t give up, Padme. Don’t give up . . ."
103 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME’S APARTMENT-LANDING ROOMDAY
"ANAKIN is in the living room, working. He sits on the couch where"
Obi-Wan was sitting. PADME enters and crosses behind him.
ANAKIN
"I sense someone familiar . . . Obi-Wan’s been here, hasn’t he?"
PADME
He came by this morning.
ANAKIN
What did he want?
PADME looks at him for a moment. ANAKIN seems tense.
PADME
He’s worried about you.
ANAKIN
"You told him about us, didn’t you?"
"She continues to walk to the bedroom, he follows."
PADME
"He’s your best friend, Anakin. He says you’re under a lot of stress."
ANAKIN
And he’s not?
PADME
You have been moody lately.
ANAKIN
I’m not moody . . .
PADME
Anakin! Don’t do this again.
ANAKIN
I don’t know … I feel . . . lost.
PADME
Lost? What do you mean? You’re always so sure of yourself. I don’t
understand.
ANAKIN
Obi-Wan and the Council don’t trust me.
PADME
They trust you with their lives. Obi-Wan loves you as a son.
ANAKIN
Something’s happening . . . I’m not the Jedi I should be. I am one of
"the most powerful Jedi, but I’m not satisfied … I want more, and I"
know I shouldn’t.
PADME
You expect too much of yourself.
They stop in front of the window in the bedroom. ANAKIN puts his
hand on her belly.
ANAKIN
I have found a way to save you.
PADME
Save me?
ANAKIN
From my nightmares.
PADME
Is that what’s bothering you?
ANAKIN
"I won’t lose you, Padme."
PADME
"I’m not going to die in childbirth, Annie. I promise you."
ANAKIN
"No, I promise you! I am becoming so powerful with my new"
"knowledge of the Force, I will be able to keep you from dying."
PADME looks ANAKIN in the eye.
PADME
"You don’t need more power, Anakin. I believe you can protect me"
"against anything, just as you are."
They embrace and kiss.
104 EXT. UTAPAU-SPACE
OBI-WAN blasts out of the BLUE JEDI FIGHTER’s hyperspace ring
and heads for the planet Utapau. The BLUE FIGHTER skims over the
"planet’s surface, flat except for a few giant sinkholes."
105 INT. UTAPAU-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY
OBI-WAN lands his ship on a Platform projecting out of the side of a
"giant sinkhole. All is quiet. A local administrator, TION MEDON,"
comes out to greet the ship. OBI-WAN climbs out of his Fighter as a
SHORT GROUND CREW looks over his ship. On a ledge above the
"landing platform, GRIEVOUS’s BODYGUARDS watch as OBI-WAN"
talks to TION MEDON.
TlON MEDON
"Greetings, young Jedi. What brings you to our remote sanctuary?"
OBI-WAN
"Unfortunately, the war."
TlON MEDON
There is no war here unless you’ve brought it with you.
OBI-WAN
"With your kind permission, I should like some fuel and to use your city"
as a base as I search nearby systems for General Grievous.
A GROUND CREW rushes out and refuels Obi-Wan’s Fighter. TION
MEDON leans close to OBI-WAN and speaks quietly.
TlON MEDON
He is here! We are being held hostage. They are watching us.
OBI-WAN
I understand.
TlON MEDON
The tenth level . . . thousands of Battle Droids . . .
OBI-WAN
"Tell your people to take shelter. If you have warriors, now is the time."
OBI-WAN starts back toward his Starfighter as TION MEDON leaves
the Landing Platform. GRIEVOUS’s BODYGUARDS retreat from the
overhead platform. OBI-WAN climbs back into his BLUE JEDI
FIGHTER. His Astro Unit (R4-G9) turns to him:
OBI-WAN
"(continuing) Geenine, take the Fighter back to the ship. I’m staying"
here. Tell Cody I’ve made contact.
The little Astro Droid BEEPS a reply.
106 EXT. UTAPAU-OBSERVATION DECK-DAY
"On a high balcony, TION MEDON looks down on the landing"
platform. A few steps behind him stands one of GENERAL
GRIEVOUS’s BODYGUARDS. They watch the canopy lower.
TlON MEDON
"I told you, all he wanted was fuel."
BODYGUARD
What was his name?
TlON MEDON
He didn’t say.
They watch as the BLUE JEDI FIGHTER takes off.
107 INT. UTAPAU-LANDING PLATFORM-HALLWAY-DAY
OBI-WAN also watches his ship take off. He is hiding in the hallway.
He quietly moves farther into the city.
108 EXT. UTAPAU STAIRWAY-SINKHOLE RIM-DAY
OBI-WAN quickly rushes up a stairway cut into the side of the
"sinkhole. It’s hard to see him. In an alcove, he carefully surveys the"
"city, then quickly moves on."
109 INT. UTAPAU-CITY-DRAGON CORRAL-DAY
"OBI-WAN makes his way through the city, looking up at the tenth"
level with electro-binoculars from his utility belt. He tries to figure out
how he is going to get up there. He hears strange bellowing cries and
he investigates.
He comes across a corral filled with about half a dozen DRAGONLIKE
LIZARDS. SEVERAL WRANGLERS are standing around.
OBI-WAN walks up to the WRANGLERS and uses the Force with his
slight hand movements.
OBI-WAN
I need transportation.
WRANGLER
"(subtitled, in native tongue) You need transportation."
OBI-WAN
Get it for me.
WRANGLER
"(subtitled, in native tongue) I will get it for you."
One of the WRANGLERS turns to the others and chatters away in his
strange tongue. OBI-WAN walks along the line of
"DRAGON/LIZARDS, checking out each one. He looks at their teeth,"
"legs, etc. Finally he pats one on the neck."
OBI-WAN
This one.
The WRANGLER brings the chosen one over to him.
WRANGLER
Boga. She answers to Boga.
OBI-WAN
"Good girl, Boga."
OBI-WAN swings onto the back of the LIZARD. The beast rears up
and scurries outside to the edge of the sinkhole.
110 EXT. UTAPAU-SINKHOLE WALL-LIZARD-DAY
"The LIZARD BOGA rears up on her hind legs again, then climbs the"
wall of the sheer cliff and starts moving up toward the tenth level. The
city appears to be deserted. OBI-WAN is alert to any movement.
111 INT. UTAPAU-CONFERENCE ROOM-GRAND CHAMBER-DAY
GENERAL GRIEVOUS stands before the COUNCIL OF
"SEPARATISTS, including NUTE GUNRAY, RUNE HAAKO."
"POGGLE THE LESSER, SHU MAI, SAN HILL PO NUDO, WAT"
"TAMBOR, and PASSEL ARGENTE. OBI-WAN hides above the"
assembly and watches intently.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
It won’t be long before the armies of the Republic track us here. I am
sending you to the Mustafar system in the Outer Rim. It is a volcanic
planet which generates a great deal of scanning interference. You will
be safe there.
NUTE GUNRAY
"Safe? Chancellor Palpatine managed to escape your grip, General,"
without Count Dooku. I have doubts about your ability to keep us
safe.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
"Be thankful, Viceroy, you have not found yourself in my grip . . . Your"
ship is waiting.
OBI-WAN is deep in thought.
112 INT. UTAPAU-TENTH LEVEL-CONTROL CENTER-DAY
The JEDI removes his cloak and jumps down behind the GENERAL.
OBI-WAN
"Hello, there!"
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
"General Kenobi, you are a bold one. I find your behavior bewildering ."
". . Surely you realize you’re doomed, (to droids) Kill him!"
"About a HUNDRED BATTLE DROIDS surround OBI-WAN,"
"GENERAL GRIEVOUS, and his BODYGUARDS. OBI-WAN looks"
"around, then walks right up to GENERAL GRIEVOUS."
They stare at each other for a moment.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
Enough of this.
The BODYGUARDS raise their power staffs to knock OBI-WAN
"away, but OBI-WAN ducks as the deadly staffs whistle over his head."
"The Jedi’s lightsaber ignites, and OBI-WAN deftly cuts one"
BODYGUARD in two. His staff flies into the air and is caught by
GENERAL GRIEVOUS. The other THREE BODYGUARDS attack
OBI-WAN with an intense fury.
OBI-WAN uses the Force to release apiece of equipment from the
"ceiling. It drops on the BODYGUARDS, smashing them. OBI-WAN"
"walks toward GRIEVOUS, slashing the last BODYGUARD to pieces."
BATTLE DROIDS move toward OBI-WAN.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
Back away. I will deal with this Jedi slime myself.
OBI-WAN
Your move.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
You fool. I have been trained in your Jedi arts by Count Dooku
"himself. Attack, Kenobi."
His arms separate and grab all four lightsabers on his belt. His four
arms create a flashing display of swordsmanship.
OBI-WAN
You forget I trained the Jedi that defeated Count Dooku!
OBI-WAN is hard-pressed to defend himself against the deadly
onslaught. They fight across the control room as the BATTLE DROID
SHARPSHOOTERS try to pick off the Jedi. OBI-WAN mounts a
ferocious counterattack and cuts off one of GRIEVOUS’s hands. A
loud EXPLOSION is heard echoing throughout the sinkhole.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS and OBI-WAN glance to the entrance of the
"control center and see CLONE TROOPS in the distance, attacking"
"DROIDS in the sinkhole. On the far wall of the sinkhole, CLONES can"
be seen rappelling onto balconies.
OBI-WAN
"I may not defeat your droids, but my troops certainly will."
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
"Army or not, you must realize you are doomed."
OBI-WAN
I don’t think so.
TWENTY CLONES suddenly rappel into the entrance of the control
"center, ray guns blazing. Chaos. Laser bolts fly everywhere as the"
"DROIDS return fire. OBI-WAN attacks GENERAL GRIEVOUS, who"
defends himself rigorously with one of his bodyguard’s electro-staffs.
OBI-WAN uses the Force to hurl GENERAL GRIEVOUS backwards.
He falls onto a lower platform and OBI-WAN jumps down after him.
113 INT. UTAPAU-TENTH LEVEL-CONTROL CENTER-DAY
More CLONES rappel into the control center and blast away at the
remaining DROIDS.
The JEDI cuts down several DROIDS as he races to the entrance of
the control center. OBI-WAN spots GENERAL GRIEVOUS racing
toward one of the landing platforms in the midst of the battle.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS jumps onto a WHEEL SCOOTER and takes
off down the wall of the sinkhole. OBI-WAN whistles for his LIZARD
"BOGA, who runs to him. OBI-WAN jumps on."
114 EXT. UTAPAU-CLIFF AND LANDING PLATFORM-DAY
The chase begins. Obi-Wan drops his lightsaber while riding Boga.
115 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-SUNSET
The sun is setting as the lights come on in the massive Senate Office
Building. The sky is red.
116 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR’S OFFICE-SUNSET
"PALPATINE listens to a delegation from the Senate, which includes"
PADME and five other Senators
"NEE ALAVAR, FANG ZAR, MALEDEE, SWEITT CONCORKILL, and"
MON CALAMARI. ANAKIN stands to one side of PALPATINE.
PALPATINE
"I understand your reservations completely, Senator, and I assure you"
the appointment of Governors will in no way compete with the duties
of the Senate.
PADME
"May I take it then, that there will be no further amendments to the"
Constitution?
PALPATINE
"I want this terrible conflict to end as much as you do, My Lady, and"
when it does I guarantee an immediate return to democracy . . .
PADME
"You are pursuing a diplomatic solution to the war, then."
PALPATINE
"You must trust me to do the right things, Senator. That is why I am"
here.
FANG ZAR
But surely . . .
The Chancellor turns on FANG ZAR.
PALPATINE
"I have said I will do what is right, that should be enough for your . . ."
committee.
PADME
"On behalf of the “delegation of two thousand,” I thank you,"
Chancellor.
PALPATINE
"I thank you for bringing this to my attention, Senator."
"PADME gives ANAKIN a frustrated look, then turns and exits with the"
other FIVE SENATORS. PALPATINE turns to ANAKIN.
PALPATINE
"(continuing) Their sincerity is to be admired, although I sense there is"
more to their request than they are telling us.
ANAKIN
What do you mean?
PALPATINE
They are not to be trusted.
ANAKIN
Surely Senator Amidala can be trusted . . .
PALPATINE
"These are unstable times for the Republic, Anakin. Some see"
instability as an opportunity. Senator Amidala is hiding something. I
can see it in her eyes.
ANAKIN
I’m sure you’re mistaken.
PALPATINE
I’m surprised your Jedi insights are not more sensitive to such things.
ANAKIN
I simply don’t sense betrayal in Senator Amidala.
PALPATINE studies ANAKIN carefully and gives him a skeptical look.
PALPATINE
"Yes, you do, but you don’t seem to want to admit it. There is much"
"conflict in you, Anakin."
117 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI WAR ROOM-EARLY EVENING
"KI-ADI-MUNDI, ANAKIN, YODA, MACE, CLONE COMMANDER"
"CODY, and AAYLA SECURA talk via holograms."
CLONE COMMANDER CODY
"Master Windu, may I interrupt? General Kenobi has made contact"
"with General Grievous, and we have begun our attack."
MACE WlNDU
"Thank you, Commander. Anakin, deliver this report to the Chancellor."
His reaction will give us a clue to his intentions.
ANAKIN
"Yes, Master."
ANAKIN leaves the room. COMMANDER CODY’s hologram
disappears.
MACE WINDU
I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi. The dark side of the Force
surrounds the Chancellor.
Kl-ADI-MUNDI
If he does not give up his emergency powers after the destruction of
"Grievous, then he should be removed from office."
MACE WINDU
That could be a dangerous move … the Jedi Council would have to
take control of the Senate in order to secure a peaceful transition . . .
Kl-ADI-MUNDI
. . . and replace the Congress with Senators who are not filled with
greed and corruption.
YODA
To a dark place this line of thought will carry us. Hmmmmm. . . . great
care we must take.
118 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR’S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING
ANAKIN brings news to PALPATINE.
ANAKIN
"Chancellor, we have just received a report from Master Kenobi. He"
has engaged General Grievous.
PALPATINE
We can only hope that Master Kenobi is up to the challenge.
ANAKIN
I should be there with him.
PALPATINE
It is upsetting to me to see that the Council doesn’t seem to fully
appreciate your talents. Don’t you wonder why they won’t make you a
Jedi Master?
ANAKIN
I wish I knew. More and more I get the feeling that I am being
excluded from the Council. I know there are things about the Force
that they are not telling me.
PALPATINE
"They don’t trust you, Anakin. They see your future. They know your"
"power will be too strong to control. Anakin, you must break through"
the fog of lies the Jedi have created around you. Let me help you to
know the subtleties of the Force.
They walk into the hallway.
ANAKIN
How do you know the ways of the Force?
PALPATINE
My mentor taught me everything about the Force . . . even the nature
of the dark side.
They stop.
ANAKIN
You know the dark side?!?
PALPATINE
"Anakin, if one is to understand the great mystery, one must study all"
"its aspects, not just the dogmatic, narrow view of the Jedi. If you wish"
"to become a complete and wise leader, you must embrace a larger"
"view of the Force. Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin. (pausing) They fear"
you. In time they will destroy you. Let me train you.
ANAKIN
I won’t be a pawn in your political game. The Jedi are my family.
PALPATINE
Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi.
"Learn to know the dark side of the Force, Anakin, and you will be able"
to save your wife from certain death.
ANAKIN
What did you say?
PALPATINE
"Use my knowledge, I beg you . . ."
ANAKIN
You’re a Sith Lord!
ANAKIN ignites his lightsaber.
PALPATINE
I know what has been troubling you . . . Listen to me. Don’t continue
"to be a pawn of the Jedi Council! Ever since I’ve known you, you’ve"
been searching for a life greater than that of an ordinary Jedi . . . a life
"of significance, of conscience."
ANAKIN
You’re wrong!
PALPATINE
Are you going to kill me?
ANAKIN
I would certainly like to.
PALPATINE
"I know you would. I can feel your anger. It gives you focus, makes"
you stronger.
ANAKIN raises his lightsaber to PALPATINE’s throat. There is a
"tense moment, then ANAKIN relaxes, and then turns off his"
lightsaber.
ANAKIN
I am going to turn you over to the Jedi Council.
PALPATINE
"Of course you should. But you’re not sure of their intentions, are you?"
What if I am right and they are plotting to take over the Republic?
ANAKIN
I will quickly discover the truth of all this.
PALPATINE
"You have great wisdom, Anakin. Know the power of the dark side."
The power to save Padme.
ANAKIN stares at him for a moment.
PALPATINE turns and moves to his office.
PALPATINE
(continuing) I am not going anywhere. You have time to decide my
fate. Perhaps you’ll reconsider and help me rule the galaxy for the
good of all . . .
PALPATINE sits behind his desk.
119 EXT. UTAPAU-CLIFF AND LANDING PLATFORM-DAY
"OBI-WAN gives the LIZARD a swift kick with the heel of his boot, and"
they take off down the vertical side of the sheer cliff. As GENERAL
GRIEVOUS reaches the landing platform where his shuttle is waiting.
OBI-WAN drops onto the top of the starship with his LIZARD.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS spins his scooter around and takes off up the
vertical cliff face with OBI-WAN and his LIZARD in hot pursuit. The
sinkhole is engulfed in a great battle between CLONES and DROIDS.
The PEOPLE OF UTAPAU cower in whatever shelter they can find.
120 EXT. UTAPAU-MAIN CITY PLAZA-DAY
A LARGE GROUP OF UTAPAUAN TROOPS on LIZARDS attack the
DROID ARMY.
OBI-WAN and GENERAL GRIEVOUS race through the city at
"breakneck speed. Passing through battle zones, narrowly escaping"
"EXPLOSIONS, laser bolts, and TROOPS from both sides."
GENERAL GRIEVOUS lays the Scooter down as he goes around
sharp turns. Obi-Wan’s LIZARD breathes hard as she tries to keep
"up. They destroy droids, equipment, and clone troops as the JEDI"
and the GENERAL cut a swath of destruction through the city.
121 EXT. UTAPAU-WINDMILLS-DAY
GENERAL GRIEVOUS works his way out onto the rim of the
"sinkhole, passing some wind blades. The evil Droid General releases"
"the brakes on the lethal blades, and they begin to spin, cutting off"
Obi-Wan’s access to the General. Obi-Wan’s LIZARD pulls up short
in front of the blades. GENERAL GRIEVOUS laughs and talks into a
comlink.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS
Prepare to move out of orbit. I will be up in a few moments.
"OBI-WAN sizes up the situation, looking for a way to get to"
GENERAL GRIEVOUS.
"The GENERAL accelerates off the edge, activating his claws, drops,"
and clings to another nearby grouping of windmills. Obi-Wan’s
"LIZARD attempts to jump to follow and barely makes it, almost falling"
into the precipice below.
122 INT. UTAPAU-CITY TUNNEL SYSTEM-DAY
"GENERAL GRIEVOUS roars through the stone block tunnel system,"
riding up on the curved walls as he goes around corners or passes
"oncoming traffic. OBI-WAN races after the Droid, his LIZARD moving"
onto the ceiling as they pass traffic. OBI-WAN catches up with
"GENERAL GRIEVOUS, and they charge through the tunnel, side by"
side. OBI-WAN grabs the Droid’s electronic staff.
123 EXT. UTAPAU-SECRET LANDING PLATFORM-DAY
Extending from the wall of a small sinkhole is a secret landing
platform with a small Federation Fighter sitting in the middle of it.
OBI-WAN and GENERAL GRIEVOUS race out of the tunnel system
and onto the landing platform.
"OBI-WAN yanks on the staff, then jumps off his LIZARD onto the"
"General’s scooter, knocking both warriors to the ground. GENERAL"
GRIEVOUS pulls out a laser pistol and fires at OBI-WAN. The Jedi
"reaches out his hand, grabs the General’s electro-staff and spins the"
"staff, blocking the laser bolts."
"OBI-WAN charges GENERAL GRIEVOUS, swinging the staff and"
"hitting the Droid in the stomach, knocking the gun away. GENERAL"
"GRIEVOUS is hit by the staff, and the Force bends his forearm. He"
"pulls OBI-WAN close to him, and they engage in a furious fight. The"
electro-staff is knocked away. The two engage in hand-to-hand
"combat. OBI-WAN struggles to avoid the deadly blows of the brutal,"
unstoppable Droid.
GENERAL GRIEVOUS’s stomachplate is loose. OBI-WAN grabs it
"and rips it off, revealing the alien life form’s guts encased in a bag in"
"the Droid’s chest. GENERAL GRIEVOUS grabs OBI-WAN, hoists him"
"over his head, and tosses him across the platform. OBI-WAN dangles"
"off the edge of the platform. He clutches the rim, trying to hold on."
The DROID then grabs the staff and charges OBI-WAN. At the last
"second, OBI-WAN reaches out his hand and uses the Force to"
retrieve the Droid’s laser pistol.
"The JEDI fires several blasts in the stomach area of the alien Droid,"
and he EXPLODES from the inside out. The smoldering Droid falls to
the ground. OBI-WAN has killed GENERAL GRIEVOUS. He pulls
himself up onto the platform and walks by the destroyed carcass.
OBI-WAN
So uncivilized . . .
"OBI-WAN brushes himself off. He throws the pistol onto the platform,"
"picks up the electro-staff, and jumps on BOGA. The trusty beast rears"
up and takes off into the tunnel system.
124 INT. JEDI GUNSHIP-LANDING PLATFORM-EARLY EVENING
"MACE and the JEDI (AGEN KOLAR, KIT FISTO, AND SAESEE TIIN)"
are preparing to board a JEDI GUNSHIP to the CHANCELLOR’s
office. ANAKIN enters the hangar.
ANAKIN
"Master Windu, I must talk to you."
MACE WINDU
"What is it, Skywalker? We are in a hurry. We have just received word"
that Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous. We are on our way to
make sure the Chancellor returns emergency powers back to the
Senate.
ANAKIN
He won’t give up his power. I’ve just learned a terrible truth. I think
Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith Lord.
MACE WINDU
A Sith Lord?
ANAKIN
Yes. The one we have been looking for.
MACE WINDU
How do you know this?
ANAKIN
He knows the ways of the Force. He has been trained to use the dark
side.
MACE WINDU
Are you sure?
ANAKIN
Absolutely.
MACE WINDU
Then our worst fears have been realized. We must move quickly if
the Jedi Order is to survive.
ANAKIN
"Master, the Chancellor is very powerful. You will need my help if you"
are going to arrest him.
MACE WINDU
"For your own good, stay out of this affair. I sense a great deal of"
"confusion in you, young Skywalker. There is much fear that clouds"
your judgment.
ANAKIN
"I must go, Master."
MACE WINDU
"No. If what you told me is true, you will have gained my trust, but for"
now remain here.
ANAKIN
"Yes, Master."
MACE WINDU
Wait for us in the Council Chamber until we return.
ANAKIN
"Yes, Master."
ANAKIN watches as the JEDI leave in their ship.
125 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI COUNCIL/PADME’S APARTMENTEARLY
EVENING
(INTERCUT)
"PADME is alone in her apartment, thinking of Anakin. ANAKIN sits"
alone in the Jedi Council Chamber thinking of PADME.
PALPATINE
"(V.O.) You do know, don’t you, if the Jedi destroy me, any chance of"
saving her will be lost.
PADME
"I truly, deeply love you. Before I die. I want you to know."
C-3PO
"My Lady, are you. . . . Are you all right?"
ANAKIN
I can’t do this … I can’t let her die.
ANAKIN rushes out of the Council Chamber and to his speeder. The
hangar door opens and he lifts off.
126 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-LANDING
PLATFORM-EARLY EVENING
The sky is still blue as a JEDI GUNSHIP lands on the Senate Office
Building landing platform.
FOUR JEDI exit the SHUTTLE and enter the Senate Office Building.
"MACE WINDU, AGEN KOLAR, KIT FISTO, and SAESEE TIIN, like"
"gunfighters out of the Old West, walk through the massive hallway,"
four across.
127 INT. CORUSCANT-LOBBY TO CHANCELLOR’S OFFICEEARLY
EVENING
"The FOUR JEDI enter the lobby, raising their arms, and send the"
"Chancellor’s aide, DAR WAC, flying against the wall, along with TWO"
REPUBLIC GUARDS. They storm into the Chancellor’s office.
128 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR’S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING
MACE arrives with THREE JEDI to arrest PALPATINE.
PALPATINE
Master Windu. I take it General Grievous has been destroyed then. I
"must say, you’re here sooner than expected."
MACE WINDU
"In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic, you are under"
"arrest, Chancellor."
MACE WINDU and the other JEDI ignite their lightsabers.
PALPATINE
"Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?"
MACE
The Senate will decide your fate.
PALPATINE
(burst of anger) I am the Senate!
MACE
Not yet!
"PALPATINE stands, a laser sword appears out of his cloak sleeve,"
and he spins toward the JEDI.
PALPATINE
"It’s treason, then."
A close shot of PALPATINE as the fight begins. Close shots of
THREE JEDI getting cut down by PALPATINE. PALPATINE and
MACE continue to fight.
Jedi Master MACE WINDU and the Sith Lord fight their way down the
hallway and into the main office area. PALPATINE is able to use the
"Force to slam MACE against the wall, but he recovers before the"
Chancellor can cut him down.
"ANAKIN lands his speeder, jumps out, and runs down a long corridor"
toward the Chancellor’s office.
"In the heat of battle, MACE cuts the window behind the Chancellor’s"
"desk, and it crashes away. MACE is forced out onto the ledge, which"
is twenty stories up. They fight over the precipice. ANAKIN arrives to
see PALPATINE and MACE fighting.
They stop as MACE forces PALPATINE to drop his sword.
PALPATINE and MACE start yelling at each other.
MACE WINDU
"You are under arrest, My Lord."
PALPATINE
Anakin! I told you it would come to this. I was right. The Jedi are
taking over.
MACE WlNDU
You old fool. The oppression of the Sith will never return. Your plot to
regain control of the Republic is over . . . you have lost . . .
PALPATINE
No! No! You will die!
"PALPATINE raises his hands, and lightning bolts shoot out. They are"
blocked by MACE’s lightsaber. PALPATINE is pushed back against
the window sill.
PALPATINE
"He is a traitor, Anakin."
MACE WlNDU
He’s the traitor. Stop him!
PALPATINE
"Come to your senses, boy. The Jedi are in revolt. They will betray"
"you, just as they betrayed me."
MACE WlNDU
Aarrrrggghhhhh . . .
PALPATINE
"You are not one of them, Anakin. Don’t let him kill me."
MACE WlNDU
Aarrrrggghhhhh . . .
PALPATINE
I am your pathway to power. I have the power to save the one you
love. You must choose. You must stop him.
MACE WlNDU
"Don’t listen to him, Anakin."
PALPATINE
Help me! Don’t let him kill me. I can’t hold on any longer. Ahhhhhhh .
. . ahhhhhhh . . . ahhhhhhh . . .
MACE pushes PALPATINE out to the edge of the ledge. As the Jedi
"moves closer, the bolts from Palpatine’s hands begin to arch back on"
him. The Chancellor’s face begins to twist and distort. His eyes
become yellow as he struggles to intensify his powers.
PALPATINE
I can’t … I give up. Help me. I am weak … I am too weak. Don’t kill
me. I give up. I’m dying. I can’t hold on any longer.
MACE WlNDU
You Sith disease. I am going to end this once and for all.
ANAKIN
"You can’t kill him, Master. He must stand trial."
MACE WlNDU
He has too much control of the Senate and the Courts. He is too
dangerous to be kept alive.
PALPATINE
I’m too weak. Don’t kill me. Please.
ANAKIN
It is not the Jedi way . . .
MACE raises his sword to kill the CHANCELLOR.
ANAKIN
(continuing) He must live . . .
PALPATINE
"Please don’t, please don’t . . ."
ANAKIN
I need him . . .
PALPATINE
Please don’t . . .
ANAKIN
NO!!!
"Just as MACE is about to slash PALPATINE, ANAKIN steps in and"
cuts off the Jedi’s hand holding the lightsaber.
"As MACE stares at ANAKIN in shock, PALPATINE springs to life."
The full force of Palpatine’s powerful Bolts blasts MACE. He attempts
"to deflect them with his one good hand, but the force is too great. As"
"blue rays engulf his body, he is flung out the window and falls twenty"
stories to his death. No more screams. No more moans. PALPATINE
lowers his arm.
PALPATINE
Power! Unlimited power!
His face has changed into a horrible mask of evil. ANAKIN looks on in
horror. PALPATINE cackles.
ANAKIN
What have I done?
ANAKIN sits.
PALPATINE
"You are fulfilling your destiny, Anakin. Become my apprentice. Learn"
to use the dark side of the Force.
ANAKIN
I will do whatever you ask.
PALPATINE
Good.
ANAKIN
Just help me save Padme’s life. I can’t live without her. I won’t let her
die. I want the power to stop death.
PALPATINE
"To cheat death is a power only one has achieved, but if we work"
"together, I know we can discover the secret."
ANAKIN kneels before PALPATINE.
ANAKIN
I pledge myself to your teachings. To the ways of the Sith.
PALPATINE
Good. Good. The Force is strong with you. A powerful Sith you will
"become. Henceforth, you shall be known as Darth . . . Vader."
ANAKIN
Thank you. my Master.
PALPATINE
"Rise, Darth Vader."
Palpatine moves over to his desk.
129 EXT. KASHYYYK-MEETING HALL-DAY
"YODA winces, closes his eyes, and holds his head. He feels a"
disturbance in the Force.
130 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR’S OFFICE-EVENING
PALPATINE is putting on his dark cloak. He is now fully DARTH
SIDIOUS.
PALPATINE
"Because the Council did not trust you, my young apprentice, I believe"
you are the only Jedi with no knowledge of this plot. When the Jedi
"learn what has transpired here, they will kill us, along with all the"
Senators.
ANAKIN
I agree. The Jedi’s next move will be against the Senate.
PALPATINE
"Every single Jedi, including your friend Obi-Wan Kenobi, is now an"
"enemy of the Republic. You understand that, don’t you?"
ANAKIN
"I understand, Master."
PALPATINE
We must move quickly. The Jedi are relentless; if they are not all
"destroyed, it will be civil war without end. First, I want you to go to the"
"Jedi Temple. We will catch them off balance. Do what must be done,"
Lord Vader. Do not hesitate. Show no mercy. Only then will you be
strong enough with the dark side to save Padme.
ANAKIN
What about the other Jedi spread across the galaxy?
PALPATINE
Their betrayal will be dealt with. After you have killed all the Jedi in
"the Temple, go to the Mustafar system. Wipe out Viceroy Gunray and"
"the other Separatist leaders. Once more, the Sith will rule the galaxy,"
and we shall have peace.
131 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE ENTRY-NIGHT
ANAKIN goes to the Jedi Temple with a battalion of Clone Troopers.
132 EXT. UTAPAU-TENTH LEVEL-LANDIXG PLATFORM-DAY
The battle between the CLONES and the DROIDS rages throughout
the sinkhole. OBI-WAN rides up to CLONE COMMANDER CODY.
OBI-WAN
"Commander, contact your troops. Tell them to move to the higher"
levels.
CLONE COMMANDER CODY
"Very good, sir."
"CLONE COMMANDER CODY starts to move away, then remembers"
something and returns to OBI-WAN.
CLONE COMMANDER CODY
"(continuing) Oh, by the way, I think you’ll be needing this."
"He hands OBI-WAN his lightsaber, and the LIZARD rears up."
OBI-WAN
"Thank you, Cody, (smiling) Now let’s get a move on. We’ve got a"
battle to win here.
CLONE COMMANDER CODY
"Yes, sir!"
OBI-WAN and the LIZARD ride off down the wall of the giant
sinkhole.
The battle rages throughout the city. CLONE COMMANDER CODY
"(2224,) takes out his comlink and listens to the HOLOGRAM OF"
"DARTH SIDIOUS as, far below, OBI-WAN can been seen battling"
DROIDS on a landing platform.
DARTH SlDIOUS
"Commander Cody, the time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six."
CLONE COMMANDER CODY
"It will be done, My Lord."
"The HOLOGRAM disappears, and CLONE COMMANDER CODY"
gestures to a nearby Clone Trooper.
CLONE COMMANDER CODY
Blast him!
The battle rages all around OBI-WAN. DROIDS and CLONES are
"everywhere. OBI-WAN is riding on a LIZARD, cutting down DROIDS"
as he races across the battlefield. Suddenly a volley of laser blasts
from behind him knocks him and his LIZARD off the wall of the
sinkhole. He looks around just in time to see his CLONE TROOPS
are firing on him.
OBI-WAN falls hundreds of feet to the bottom of the water-filled
sinkhole.
133 EXT. MYGEETO-DAWN
The sky slowly awakens on the crystal world of Mygeeto. A battle
rages. Clone troops battle the droid armies across a long bridge. KIADI-
MUNDi uses his light saber to deflect enemy fire. CLONE
COMMANDER BACARA (1138) exits a Gunship near the entrance to
"the city. He rallies his TROOPS to attack the city, then gets a"
message on his comlink. He stops and moves to one side as a
HOLOGRAM OF DARTH SIDIOUS appears on the comlink in the
palm of his hand. He moves further into the shadows.
DARTH SlDIOUS
Commander 1138 . . .
CLONE COMMANDER BACARA
"Yes, sir."
DARTH SlDIOUS
The time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six.
CLONE COMMANDER BACARA
"It will be done, My Lord."
"DARTH SIDIOUS fades, and the CLONE COMMANDER snaps the"
"comlink closed and looks to the main plaza of the city, where KI-ADIMUNDI"
is leading the charge. The clones stop. KI-ADI-MUNDI turns
around and is blasted by clone fire. He’s killed before he can defend
himself.
134 EXT. FELUCIA-FOREST-DAY
A column of CLONE WALKERS marches across the forest floor. The
STRANGE CALLS of the alien forest creatures of FELUCIA suddenly
stop. The Jedi AAYLA SECURA and her CLONE TROOPS brace for
an ambush.
AAYLA
Steady. . . . steady . . .
They all look around for signs of the enemy. CLONE COMMANDER
BLY moves up behind the Jedi.
AAYLA
"(continuing) Bly, do you think they’re Droids?"
BLY
No.
BLY blasts AAYLA in the back. The OTHER CLONES fire on her as
she hits the ground.
"Another Jedi, BARRISS OFFEE, is cutting down a patrol of DROIDS"
when a CLONE WALKING TANK and SEVEN CLONE TROOPERS
round a corner and blast the Jedi away.

"YODA drops his gimer stick, clutches his chest, and rests against a"
wall.
136 EXT. KASHYYYK-EDGE OF VILIAGE-DAY
The battle appears to be over. WOOKIEES stack destroyed Droids
"while CLONES assess the damage to their equipment. A Jedi,"
"LUMINARA UNDULI, talks with EIGHT CLONE OFFICERS standing"
in a circle around her. Suddenly they reveal their hidden pistols and
blast her before she can react.
The Jedi QUINLAN VOS is riding on top of a CLONE TURBO TANK.
The main cannon of a second tank slowly swings to point right at him
and a COUPLE OF CLONES.
"The cannon fires, and QUINLAN VOS and the CLONES disappear in"
a huge EXPLOSION.

"her, causing her to crash in a huge EXPLOSION."
141 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR’S OFFICE-NIGHT
"DARTH SIDIOUS stands alone in his private office, illuminated only"
from a hologram projector beam from above. A small HOLOGRAM
OF COMMANDER GREE stands in front of him.
CLONE COMMANDER GREE
"Yes, My Lord."
DARTH SIDIOUS
The time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six.
142 EXT. KASHYYYK-MEETING HALL BALCONY-DAY
"A vista of waterways, high green mesas, and giant tree cities serves"
"as a backdrop for the fierce battle, CLONES AND WOOKIEES"
"against TRADE FEDERATION DROID ARMIES, with treaded tanklike"
vehicles. CLONE COMMANDER GREE holds his comlink.
CLONE COMMANDER GREE
"It will be done, My Lord."
CLONE COMMANDER GREE snaps his comlink shut.
YODA watches from the balcony. The battle rages as CLONES and
WOOKIEES attack DROIDS coming across the water on
CORPORATE ALLIANCE TANK DROIDS. CHEWBACCA and
TARFFUL stand on either side of the Jedi Master as he watches the
battle below. CLONE COMMANDER GREE and ONE OFFICER walk
onto the balcony toward YODA. YODA stands looking over the
"battlefield below. When they are close enough, the CLONES reveal"
their weapons and fire.
"But faster than the CLONES can reveal their weapons, YODA ignites"
"his lightsaber, leaps in the air, and beheads both CLONES."
CHEWBACCA and TARFFUL fire their weapons as more CLONES
enter the hall. The Wookiees call out to YODA to follow them.
CHEWBACCA picks YODA up and carries him away.
143 EXT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-NIGHT
A JEDI is surrounded and gunned down by CLONE TROOPERS.

"He exits Shaak Ti’s room and enters a hallway, where the battle is"
taking place.
145 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-BATTLE-NIGHT
ANAKIN enters a room full of YOUNGLINGS huddled in a corner.
YOUNGLINGS
"Master Skywalker, there are too many of them. What are we going to"
do?
ANAKIN looks back at them with a stern expression on his face and
ignites his lightsaber.
146 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME’S APARTMENT-PRE-DAWN
C-3PO and PADME look out the apartment window.
C-3PO
The Chancellor’s office indicated Master Anakin returned to the Jedi
"Temple. Don’t worry, My Lady. I am sure he will be all right."
PADME bursts into tears.
147 EXT. CORUSCANT-CITYSCAPE-PRE-DAWN
The city planet is covered in a hazy glow. A column of black smoke
can be seen rising in the distance. BAIL ORGANA’s Speeder flies
"overhead, straight toward the smoke."
148 EXT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-LANDING PLATFORM-PREDAWN
The Jedi Temple is on fire. Large plumes of smoke billow toward the
sky as BAIL ORGANA lands his Speeder on a Jedi Temple platform.
FOUR CLONE TROOPERS stand guard at the entrance to the
Temple. They lower their guns as BAIL gets out of his Speeder and
walks toward them.
BAIL ORGANA
What’s going on here?!?
CLONE SERGEANT
"There’s been a rebellion. Don’t worry, sir, the situation is under"
control.
The CLONES bar the Senator from entering the Temple.
CLONE SERGEANT
"(continuing) I’m sorry, sir. No one is allowed entry."
The CLONES point their guns at BAIL and cock them.
CLONE SERGEANT
"(continuing) It’s time for you to leave, sir."
BAIL ORGANA
And so it is.
"BAIL reluctantly heads hack toward his Speeder. Suddenly, several"
"SHOTS RING OUT. BAIL turns and sees a ten-year-old Jedi, ZETT"
"JUKASSA, fighting the CLONES. Several more CLONES join in the"
"fight, followed by CLONE COMMANDER APPO (1119), who points at"
BAIL.
CLONE COMMANDER APPO
Get him! Shoot him!
SEVERAL CLONES start firing at BAIL. The Senator jumps for cover
"behind his Speeder, starting the engines and pulling out his laser"
pistol.
"The YOUNG JEDI cuts down several CLONES, including APPO,"
before he is overrun and shot.
The Speeder takes off with BAIL clinging to the side. The CLONES
fire at it as it disappears into the cityscape.
149 EXT. CORUSCANT-CITYSCAPE-PRE-DAWN
BAIL ORGANA struggles to pull himself into the Speeder as it races
"along through the cityscape. Finally, he climbs in, just as the Speeder"
is about to hit a building. BAIL steers clear of the building and races
away.
150 EXT. UTAPAU-UNDERWATER SINKHOLE-DAY
The Jedi dives below the surface amid a barrage of laser fire. He
"dives deeper under the water, fumbling in his utility belt for a"
breathing device. He finds it and puts it in his mouth. He swims
underwater until the CLONE TROOPS give up and stop filing.
151 EXT. UTAPAU-UNDERWATER CAVES-DAY
OBI-WAN removes the breathing apparatus after coming up from
underwater. He starts to climb the rock wall.
OBI-WAN climbs the wall to the second cave just as TWO LITTLE
SEEKER DRONES pop out of the water with their searchlights
glowing. OBI-WAN presses himself against the wall of the smaller
cave as the TWO SEEKER DRONES search the grotto. One of the
SEEKERS begins to enter the cave in which OBI-WAN is hiding. OBIWAN
presses further into the wall. The light shines on the opposite
"wall and moves to the back of the cave, illuminating a huge NOS"
MONSTER. OBI-WAN holds his breath. The SEEKER is confused for
"a moment, then the NOS MONSTER lunges at the SMALL DROID"
and consumes it in one bite.
"The NOS MONSTER’S lunge takes him past OBI-WAN, out of the"
"cave, and into the water."
The SECOND SEEKER shines its light on the NOS MONSTER as
the evil creature tries to grab the LITTLE DRONE. OBI-WAN slinks
off toward the back of the cave. He comes upon a nest of BABY NOS
MONSTERS. They SCREECH and make horrible sounds. OBI-WAN
jumps over them and continues on his way through the tunnel
system.
152 EXT. KASHYYYK-LAKE ON VILLAGE EDGE-DUSK
CLONES in modified one-man AT-ST’s and Swamp Speeders flash
their searchlights across the gloomy lake. The light of one of the ATST’s
spots something floating in the water. It is what’s left of a
Wookiee catamaran. The body of a dead Wookiee (TARFFUL) is
lying across the stern of the wreckage of the flying boat. There is
some movement on the boat. The CLONE SERGEANT on the AT-ST
fires a warning shot past the boat.
AT-ST CLONE SERGEANT
Everyone out of there!
A CRAZY LITTLE CREATURE about two feet high pops its head over
the rail. The creature is covered with mud. His long hair is frizzed out
in all directions.
CREATURE
Wookiee good . . . eat Wookiee. (crazy little laugh)
CLONE SERGEANT
Did you find something?
CREATURE
"It’s nothing, nothing. (laughs)"
CLONE SERGEANT
"It’s nothing, nothing. All these Wookiees are dead. Move to the east."
CLONE TROOPER
"Yes, sir."
"Suddenly, CHEWBACCA climbs up behind the AT-ST CLONE,"
"dripping wet, and throws the CLONE SERGEANT into the water."
CHEWIE BARKS.
CREATURE
"Right you are, Chewbacca. Faster that will be."
"TARFFUL jumps up in the boat, and the CREATURE takes off his"
hair. It is Yoda.
YODA
"Stink, this mud does. A moment to bathe, give me."
"YODA, covered with mud, jumps into the water. TARFFUL climbs"
onto the AT-ST with CHEWBACCA. YODA is out of the water and
putting his robes back on.
YODA
"(continuing) Not far, are we, from the emergency ship. Quickly . . ."
YODA whistles and a large ALIEN FLYING INSECT called CANCELL
appears. YODA jumps on the insect’s back and they take off.
The WOOKIEES follow on the AT-ST. The CLONES continue to
search the swamp.
153 EXT. KASHYYYK-HILLS OVERLOOKING LAKE-DUSK
The AT-ST marches up the hill and stops. The WOOKIEES jump
down. YODA lands on CAN-CELL nearby. CHEWBACCA goes to a
tree and pulls down one of its branches.
"The ground opens up, and a small WOOKIEE ESCAPE POD rises"
into the field. YODA opens the door of the pod.
YODA
"Good-bye. Chewbacca and Tarfful, miss you I will. Good friends you"
"are. For your help, much gratitude and respect, I have."
The Wookiees BARK as the Jedi climbs into the WOOKIEE POD and
takes off into the dusk sky.
154 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDINGUNDERGROUND
STARSHIP LANDING PLATFORM-DAY
BAIL ORGANA walks out of a tunnel onto a huge underground
platform with two of his AIDES. He is stopped by TWO ROYAL
GUARDS.

"check them over and give them back, then BAIL and his CREW walk"
on board his Starship.
155 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDINGUNDERGROUND

morning sky.
156 INT ALDERAAN-STARCRUISER-HALLWAY-DAY
BAIL ORGANA is greeted by CAPTAIN ANTILLES and TWO
ALDERAAN TROOPERS.
BAIL ORGANA
Were you able to get hold of a Jedi homing beacon?
CAPTAIN ANTILLES
"Yes, sir. We’ve encountered no opposition. The clones are still a bit"
confused. It appears no one is in command.
BAIL ORGANA
That will change soon. Hopefully we will be able to intercept a few
Jedi before they walk into this catastrophe.
157 EXT. UTAPAU-SINKHOLE WALL-LATE DAY
OBI-WAN hides from a group of CLONE TROOPERS.
CLONE CAPTAIN
Did you find Kenobi?
CLONE TROOPER
No one could have survived that fall.
He watches them pass.
CLONE CAPTAIN
Start loading your men on the ship.
CLONE TROOPER
"Yes, sir."
"OBI-WAN tries to sneak back to the secret platform, down a flight of"
stairs.
158 EXT. UTAPAU-SECRET LANDING PLATFORM-LATE DAY
OBI-WAN makes his way out of the cave and onto General
Grievous’s secret landing platform. He runs to the Starfighter and
climbs into the one-man ship. The Starfighter takes off and
disappears into the sky.
159 EXT. UTAPAU-SPACE
OBI-WAN flies away from the planet Utapau in General Grievous’s
tiny Starfighter.
160 INT. GENERAL GRIEVOUS’S STARFIGHTER-SPACE
OBI-WAN activates the controls on the Starfighter. He punches in
several coordinates and codes. A BEEPING SOUND is heard. It
quickly speeds up until it is a steady tone. OBI-WAN speaks into his
comlink.
OBI-WAN
Emergency Code Nine Thirteen … I have no contact on any
frequency. Are there any Jedi out there? . . . anywhere . . .
A BURST OF STATIC is heard- and a FUZZY HOLOGRAM image
appears.
BAIL
(hologram) . . . Kenobi . . .
OBI-WAN
(continuing) I’ve locked on. Repeat.
"The FUZZY HOLOGRAM image comes into focus, and it is BAIL"
ORGANA.
BAIL ORGANA
Master Kenobi??
OBI-WAN
Senator Organa! My Clone Troops turned on me … I need help.
BAIL ORGANA
We have just rescued Master Yoda. It appears this ambush has
happened everywhere. We’re sending you our coordinates.
161 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME’SAPARTMENT-PRE-DAWN
"PADME stands before the window of her living room, watching the"
plume of smoke from the Jedi Temple. C-3PO enters from the
bedroom.
C-3PO
"My Lady, there’s a Jedi fighter docking on the veranda."
PADME turns and rushes to the bedroom.
162 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME’S APARTMENT-VERANDA-PREDAWN
THREEPIO walks out to ANAKIN’s ship and talks with ARTOO.
ARTOO beeps.
THREEPIO
Hush! Not so loud!
PADME rushes onto the veranda as ANAKIN exits his GREEN JEDI
FIGHTER. They embrace.
PADME
Are you all right? I heard there was an attack on the Jedi Temple . . .
you can see the smoke from here.
ANAKIN
I’m fine. I’m fine. I came to see if you and the baby are safe.
PADME
"Captain Typho’s here, we’re safe. What’s happening?"
C-3PO continues to talk to R2-D2 on the GREEN FIGHTER.
C-3PO
What is going on?
ARTOO SQUEAKS and BEEPS.
C-3PO
(continuing) You can’t be anymore confused than I am.
ANAKIN
The situation is not good. The Jedi have tried to overthrow the
Republic . . .
PADME
I can’t believe that!
ANAKIN
"I couldn’t either at first, but it’s true. I saw Master Windu attempt to"
assassinate the Chancellor myself.
C-3PO leans over and whispers to ARTOO.
C-3PO
Something important is going on! I heard a rumor they are going to
banish all droids.
ARTOO BEEPS rather loudly. C-3PO puts his fingers to his lips.
C-3PO
(continuing) Shhhhhh . . . not so loud.
ARTOO BEEPS quietly.
C-3PO
"(continuing) Whatever it is, we’ll be the last to know."
PADME
"Anakin, what are you going to do?"
ANAKIN looks down for a moment and then walks away from Padme.
ANAKIN
I will not betray the Republic . . . my loyalties lie with the Chancellor
and with the Senate . . . and with you.
ANAKIN turns and walks back to Padme.
PADME
What about Obi-Wan?
ANAKIN
I don’t know . . . Many Jedi have been killed. We can only hope that
he’s remained loyal to the Chancellor.
PADME
How could this have happened?
ANAKIN
"The Republic is unstable, Padme. The Jedi aren’t the only ones trying"
to take advantage of the situation. There are also traitors in the
Senate.
PADME stands and reacts ever so slightly.
PADME
What are you saying?
ANAKIN
You need to distance yourself from your friends in the Senate. The
Chancellor said they will be dealt with when this conflict is over.
PADME
What if they start an inquisition? I’ve opposed this war. What will you
do if I become a suspect?
ANAKIN
That won’t happen. I won’t let it.
PADME
"Oh, Anakin, I’m afraid."
ANAKIN takes PADME in his arms.
ANAKIN
"Have faith, my love. Everything will soon be set right. The Chancellor"
has given me a very important mission. The Separatists have
gathered in the Mustafar system. I’m going there to end this war. Wait
"for me until I return . . . things will be different, I promise."
They kiss.
ANAKIN
"(continuing) Please, wait for me."
PADME
I will.
ANAKIN gets into his Fighter as THREEPIO backs away.
C-3PO
"(to Artoo) Well, he is under a lot of stress, Artoo."
ARTOO beeps.
C-3PO
"(continuing) Take care, my little friend."
"ARTOO BEEPS a good-bye, and the fighter takes off. PADME is left"
alone on the veranda. She starts to cry. THREEPIO comes up to her.
C-3PO
"(continuing) My Lady, is there anything I might do?"
PADME
"No thank you, Threepio."
G-3PO
"A snack, perhaps?"
PADME
No.
THREEPIO starts to move off.
C-3PO
I feel so helpless.
163 EXT. ALDERAAN-STARCRUISER-SPACE
OBI-WAN’s ship docks with Bail Organa’s Starcruiser.
164 INT. ALDERAAN-STARCRUISER-HALLWAY-DAY
The door to the main hallway slides open. OBI-WAN enters and is
greeted by YODA and BAIL ORGANA. The three walk down the
hallway.
BAIL ORGANA
You made it.
YODA
"Master Kenobi, dark times are these. Good to see you. it is."
OBI-WAN
"You were attacked by your Clones, also?"
YODA
"With the help of the Wookiees, barely escape, I did."
OBI-WAN
How many other Jedi managed to survive?
YODA
"Heard from no one, have we."
BAIL ORGANA
I saw thousands of troops attack the Jedi Temple. That’s why I went
looking for Yoda.
OBI-WAN
Have we had any contact from the Temple?
YODA
"Received a coded retreat message, we have."
BAIL ORGANA
It requests all Jedi to return to the Temple. It says that the war is over
. . .
OBI-WAN
"Well, then we must go back! If there are other stragglers, they will fall"
into the trap and be killed.
BAIL ORGANA
It’s too dangerous to return.
YODA
"Suggest dismantling the coded signal, do you?"
OBI-WAN
"Yes, Master. There is too much at stake here, and we need a clearer"
picture of what has happened.
YODA
I agree. In a dark place we find ourselves … a little more knowledge
might light our way.
165 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LAVA FIELDS-DAY
"Workers move across the lava beds, gathering the magma. A column"
of aliens riding giant MUSTAFAR FLEAS marches forward.
166 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY
A HOLOGRAM of DARTH SIDIOUS is in the center of the room.
NUTE GUNRAY and the REST OF THE SEPARATIST COALITION
watch SIDIOUS.
NUTE GUNRAY
"The plan has gone as you had promised, My Lord."
DARTH SIDIOUS
"You have done well, Viceroy. When my new apprentice, Darth Vader,"
"arrives, he will take care of you."
The hologram disappears.
167 INT. CRUISER-COCKPIT
"The Republic Cruiser heads toward Coruscant. OBI-WAN, BAIL,"
"YODA, and TWO PILOTS sit in the cockpit."
PILOT
"We are receiving a message from the Chancellor’s office, sir."
BAIL ORGANA
Send it through.
PILOT
"Yes, sir."
The PILOT pushes some buttons. MAS AMEDDA appears on screen.
MAS AMEDDA
Senator Organa . . . the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic
requests your presence at a special session of Congress.
BAIL ORGANA
Tell the Chancellor I will be there.
MAS AMEDDA
Very well. He will be expecting you.
MAS AMEDDA’s image disappears from the screen.
BAIL ORGANA
It could be a trap.
OBI-WAN
"No, I don’t think so. The Chancellor will not be able to control the"
thousands of star systems without keeping the Senate intact.
YODA
"If a special session of Congress there is, easier for us to enter the"
Jedi Temple it will be.
168 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE LANDING PLATFORM-LATE DAY
"OBI-WAN, BAIL, and YODA land on Coruscant. The elevator door"
"opens, and they step out."
GUARD
"Welcome back, Senator. May I see your clearance?"
BAIL ORGANA
Certainly.
GUARD
"Thank you, you may proceed. We will take custody of the Jedi."
OBI-WAN
It would be better if we stayed with the Senator.
GUARD
It would be better if they stayed with you.
BAIL and his AIDES go into the Senate. YODA and OBI-WAN head
for the Jedi Temple.

ANAKIN’s Jedi Starfighter heads for the hazy blood-red planet of
Mustafar.
170 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY
ANAKIN flies over the volcanoes of Mustafar and lands his Jedi
Starfighter on a complex of Landing Platforms. His cockpit opens as
R2-D2 pops from the ship with a happy BEEP.
ANAKIN
Artoo . . . stay with the ship.
ARTOO lets out a sad little BEEP and moves back toward the ship.
171 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY
"ANAKIN, putting on his hood, walks across a walkway upon arriving"
on Mustafar.
172 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY
ANAKIN appears in the doorway of the control center.
NUTE GUNRAY
"Welcome, Lord Vader. We’ve been expecting you."
Everyone in the room looks to him as he raises his hand toward a
"control panel, and all the exits close. The confused SEPARATISTS"
look around in bewilderment.
173 EXT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-LATE DAY
Smoke from the smoldering shell of the Jedi Temple fills the air with a
brown haze.
174 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-MAIN ENTRANCE-LATE

A DOZEN CLONE TROOPERS stand guard at the entrance of the
"Jedi Temple. Suddenly there is a flash of a lightsaber, a flurry of"
"confusion, and all of the Clone Troopers are dead on the floor. YODA"
and OBI-WAN stand in the middle of the carnage.
OBI-WAN
There are several battalions of Clone Troopers on every level. Many
are dressed as Jedi.
YODA
"Dismantle the coded signal quickly. That group back there, soon"
discovered will be.
175 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE BUILDING-SUNSET
The awesome Senate Building looms over the city. The endless
traffic continues to clutter the skyline.
176 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMBER-SUNSET
The Chancellor is in the podium in the center of the vast arena giving

He enters the Senate Pod of Naboo and sits next to PADME. JAR
"JAR, CAPTAIN TYPHO and TWO HANDMAIDENS are in the pod"
also.
PALPATINE
. . . and the Jedi Rebellion has been foiled.
BAIL ORGANA
I was held up. What’s happening?
PADME
"The Chancellor has been elaborating on a plot by the Jedi, to"
overthrow the Senate.
BAIL ORGANA
That’s not true!
PADME
He’s been presenting evidence all afternoon.
BAIL ORGANA
"And the Senate will go along with it, just like they always do."
PALPATINE
The remaining Jedi will be hunted down and defeated. (applause)
Any collaborators will suffer the same fate. (applause)

177 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-HALLWAY-SUNSET

the HUNDREDS OF CLONE TROOPERS. They use the Force to
distract the CLONES when they can.
YODA and OBI-WAN walk through the ruins of the Temple until they
come across the bodies of some students.
OBI-WAN
Not even the younglings survived.
YODA
"Killed not by clones, this Padawan. By a lightsaber, he was."
OBI-WAN
. . .Who?? Who could have done this?
178 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY
"ANAKIN ignites his lightsaber, NUTE and the OTHERS panic. The"
"DROIDS at the controls and the GUARDS grab their weapons, but it"
is too late. They are cut down in a flash. The Separatists bang on the
"doors, and NUTE and RUNE HAAKO flee under a table."
"ANAKIN, stone-faced, moves through the room like the grim reaper."
Bodies drop everywhere. SCREAMS are cut short as the head of the
Banking Clan dies.

"MAI, and the REST OF THE SEPARATISTS run into the conference"
room.

181 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMBER-SUNSET
PALPATINE continues his speech at the podium.
PALPATINE
"The war is over. (applause) The Separatists have been defeated,"
(applause) and the Jedi rebellion has been foiled. We stand on the
threshold of a new beginning.
There is a long period of APPLAUSE.
PADME
"Well, this is the moment we discover if he intends to return the"
Republic to a democracy.
PALPATINE
"In order to ensure our security and continuing stability, the Republic"
"will be reorganized into the first Galactic Empire, for a safe and"
secure society which I assure you will last for ten thousand years.
"There is a loud, sustained CHEER from the Senate. BAIL ORGANA"
"and PADME sit, dumbfounded."
PALPATINE
(continuing) An empire that will continue to be ruled by this august
"body, and a sovereign ruler chosen for life . . ."
The Senate CHEERS again. BAIL and PADME are devastated.
PADME begins to cry.
PALPATINE
(continuing) An empire ruled by the majority . . . Ruled by a new
constitution . . .
The Senate APPLAUDS.
PADME
"So this is how liberty dies, with thunderous applause . . ."
BAIL ORGANA
We cannot let this happen.
He starts to stand up. PADME stops him.
PADME
Not now! There will be a time.

ROOM-DAY
"After everyone in the Main Control Room is dead, ANAKIN moves to"
"the small conference room where WAT TAMBOR. SHU MAI, and"
some OTHER SEPARATISTS are hiding. RUNE HAAKO tries to run
but is trapped by a dead-end as ANAKIN advances.
RUNE HAAKO
"Stop! Enough, this is not right!"
RUNE is cut down. NUTE GUNRAY crawls out from under the table
"and opens the Main Door, allowing DESTROYER DROIDS to enter."
"WAT TAMBOR is cut down, along with SHU MAI. DESTROYER"
"DROIDS appear in the doorway and blast away, causing total"
"destruction. When the firing is over, ANAKIN is gone. Blown away?"
No. ANAKIN drops from the ceiling behind the TWO DROIDS and
cuts them to pieces before they know what hit them.
183 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-HALLWAY-DAY
NUTE GUNRAY is the last Separatist leader alive. ANAKIN moves on
to find NUTE GUNRAY hiding in an alcove.
NUTE GUNRAY
The war is over. Lord Sidious promised us peace … we only want…
NUTE GUNRAY is cut down in midsentence.
184 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-COMPUTER ROOM-NIGHT
"OBI-WAN stands in a large computer area as YODA looks on, in the"
hatchway to the Main Control Center.
OBI-WAN
I’ve recalibrated the code warning all surviving Jedi to stay away.
YODA
"Good… For the Clones to discover the recalibration, a long time it will"
"take. To change it back, longer still. Hurry."
185 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-CONTROL CENTER-NIGHT
OBI-WAN enters the Main Control Center with YODA and heads for
the hologram area.
OBI-WAN
"Wait, Master. There is something I must know . . ."
YODA
"If into the security recordings you go, only pain will you find."
OBI-WAN
"I must know the truth, Master."
OBI-WAN moves to a panel and flips some switches. He sees a
"HOLOGRAM of ANAKIN slaughtering JEDI, including the YOUNG"
ONES. OBI-WAN and YODA react.
OBI-WAN
(continuing) It can’t be . . . It can’t be . . .
"As ANAKIN surveys the carnage, a DARK-ROBED SITH LORD"
enters. ANAKIN turns to DARTH SIDIOUS and kneels before him.
ANAKIN
"The traitors have been taken care of, Lord Sidious."
DARTH SlDIOUS
"Good . . . good . . . You have done well, my new apprentice. Do you"
feel your power growing?
ANAKIN
"Yes, My Master."
DARTH SlDIOUS
"Now, Lord Vader, now go and bring peace to the Empire."
OBI-WAN watches in horror. Tears well up in his eyes.
OBI-WAN
I can’t watch any more.
OBI-WAN switches off the hologram. The TWO JEDI stand in silence
for a few moments.
YODA
"Destroy the Sith, we must."
OBI-WAN
Send me to kill the Emperor. I will not kill Anakin.
YODA
"To fight this Lord Sidious, strong enough, you are not."
OBI-WAN
He is like my brother … I cannot do it.
YODA
"Twisted by the dark side, young Skywalker has become. The boy you"
"trained, gone he is . . . Consumed by Darth Vader."
OBI-WAN
How could it have come to this?
YODA
"To question, no time there is."
OBI-WAN
I do not know where the Emperor has sent him. I don’t know where to
look.
YODA
"Use your feelings, Obi-Wan, and find him, you will. Visit the new"
"Emperor, my task is. May the Force be with you."
OBI-WAN
"May the Force be with you, Master Yoda."
186 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME’S APARTMENT-AFTERNOON
A DC0052 Intergalactic Speeder pulls up to the veranda landing of
Padme’s apartment.
187 EXT. CORUSCANT -PADME’S APARTMENT-VERANDAAFTERNOON
"The cockpit of the sleek yellow Galactic Speeder opens, and a"
HOODED FIGURE emerges and walks onto the veranda. An ALARM
GOES OFF deep in the apartment. The FIGURE stops before a
security curtain that protects the veranda. C-3PO enters the veranda
and approaches the FIGURE.
C-3PO
"Hello, might I help you . . . Oh, it’s you, Master Kenobi. Come in,"
quickly.
"The security curtain disappears, and the FIGURE lifts his hood. It is"
OBI-WAN. The alarm stops sounding.
OBI-WAN
Has Anakin been here . . . ?
C-3PO
Yes . . . right after the attack on the Jedi Temple.
PADME comes down the stairs in a robe. THREEPIO leaves.
PADME
Master Kenobi . . .
She embraces Obi-Wan.
PADME
"(continuing) Oh, Obi-Wan, thank goodness . . . you’re alive."
OBI-WAN
The Republic has fallen. Padme . . . The Jedi Order is no more . . .
PADME
"I know, it’s hard to believe everything to which we’ve dedicated our"
lives is gone.
OBI-WAN
I believe we have been part of a plot hundreds of years in the making.
PADME
"The Senate is still intact, there is some hope."
OBI-WAN
No. Padme . . . It’s over . . . The Sith now rule the galaxy as they did
before the Republic.
PADME
The Sith!?!
OBI-WAN
I’m here looking for Anakin . . . When was the last time you saw him?
PADME
Yesterday.
OBI-WAN
And do you know where he is now?
PADME
(looks down) No.
OBI-WAN
"Padme, I need your help. He’s in grave danger."
PADME
From the Sith?
OBI-WAN
"From himself . . . Padme, Anakin has turned to the dark side."
PADME
You’re wrong! How could you even say that?
OBI-WAN
I have seen a security hologram of him killing younglings.
PADME
Not Anakin! He couldn’t!
OBI-WAN
He was deceived by a lie. We all were. It appears that the Chancellor
"is behind everything, including the war. Palpatine is the Sith Lord"
"we’ve been looking for. After the death of Count Dooku, Anakin"
became his new apprentice.
PADME
I don’t believe you … I can’t.
OBI-WAN
"Padme, I must find him."
PADME
"You’re going to kill him, aren’t you?"
OBI-WAN
He has become a very great threat.
"As PADME moves to sit down, she reveals her pregnancy."
PADME
I can’t . . .
OBI-WAN
"Anakin is the father, isn’t he?"
PADME looks away.
OBI-WAN
(continuing) I’m so sorry.
"OBI-WAN turns and leaves as PADME stares transfixed, not knowing"
what to do. She is worried and tormented. OBI-WAN takes off in the
Speeder. She studies the japor snippet that is hanging around her
neck.
188 INT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY
R2-D2 waits forlornly for his Master in front of the Jedi Starfighter.
189 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY
ANAKIN surveys the slaughter with a crazed look in his eyes.
190 INT. MUSTAFAR-CONTROL CENTER-BALCONY-DAY
"ANAKIN stares out at Mustafar, standing on the control room"
balcony.
191 EXT. CORUSCANT-LANDING PLATFORM-SUNSET
A small Naboo Skiff rests on a landing platform in the vast congestion
"of Coruscant. PADME gets out of her Speeder, followed by CAPTAIN"
TYPHO and C-3PO.
CAPTAIN TYPHO
"My Lady, let me come with you."
PADME
"There is no danger. The fighting is over, and . . . this is personal."
TYPHO bows.
CAPTAIN TYPHO
"As you wish, My Lady . . . but I strongly disagree."
PADME
"I’ll be all right, Captain."
He goes to the speeder and gets in.
PADME
"(continuing) This is something I must do myself. Besides, Threepio"
will look after me.
C-3PO
"Oh, dear."
TYPHO takes off and PADME and THREEPIO board the small
NABOO SKIFF. A shadow moves out from under the SKIFF. It is
OBI-WAN. He quickly jumps on the retracting ramp as the SKIFF
takes off.
192 INT. NABOO SKIFF
"THREEPIO chatters away as PADME breaks down in tears, the"
painful reality sinking in.
C-3PO
Green light. Do you know that I think I’m beginning to get the hang of
this flying business.
OBI-WAN stows away on Padme’s ship. The ship lifts from the
landing platform and heads into the traffic lanes.
193 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE ARENA-CHANCELLOR’S
HOLDING OFFICE-SUNSET
A HOLOGRAM OF ANAKIN appears before PALPATINE in his office
at the bottom of the Senate Arena.
DARTH VADER
"The Separatists are taken care of, My Master."
DARTH SlDIOUS
"It is finished, then. You have restored peace and justice to the galaxy."
"You have done well, Lord Vader."
DARTH VADER
"Thank you, My Master."
194 INT. MUSTAFAR-COXFERENCE ROOM-DAY
A Hologram of Sidious speaks with Anakin in the Mustafar control
room.
DARTH SlDIOUS
Send a message to the ships of the Trade Federation. Tell them the
Separatist leaders have been wiped out. Grievous and Dooku have
been destroyed. All droid units must shut down immediately.
DARTH VADER
"Very good, My Lord."
ANAKIN sees Padme’s ship arriving on the screen and goes out to
meet her.
195 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY
The sleek NABOO SKIFF lands on the Mustafar landing platform
near Anakin’s GREEN STARFIGHTER. ANAKIN runs up to the
SKIFF as the ramp lowers. PADME runs to him.
ANAKIN
"Padme, I saw your ship . . ."
They embrace.
PADME
"Oh, Anakin!"
ANAKIN
"It’s all right, you’re safe now. What are you doing out here?"
PADME
I was so worried about you. Obi-Wan told me terrible things.
ANAKIN
What things?
PADME
He said you have turned to the dark side . . . that you killed
younglings.
ANAKIN
Obi-Wan is trying to turn you against me.
PADME
He cares about us.
ANAKIN
Us??!
PADME
He knows . . . He wants to help you.
ANAKIN
Is Obi-Wan going to protect you? He can’t … he can’t help you. He’s
not strong enough.
PADME
"Anakin, all I want is your love."
ANAKIN
"Love won’t save you, Padme. Only my new powers can do that."
PADME
At what cost? You are a good person. Don’t do this.
ANAKIN
I won’t lose you the way I lost my mother! I’ve become more powerful
than any Jedi has ever dreamed of and I’ve done it for you. To protect
you.
PADME
Come away with me. Help me raise our child. Leave everything else
behind while we still can.
ANAKIN
"Don’t you see, we don’t have to run away anymore. I have brought"
peace to the Republic. I am more powerful than the Chancellor. I can
"overthrow him, and together you and I can rule the galaxy. Make"
things the way we want them to be.
PADME
I don’t believe what I’m hearing . . . Obi-Wan was right. You’ve
changed.
ANAKIN
I don’t want to hear any more about Obi-Wan. The Jedi turned
against me. Don’t you turn against me.
PADME
"I don’t know you anymore. Anakin, you’re breaking my heart. I’ll never"
"stop loving you, but you are going down a path I can’t follow."
ANAKIN
Because of Obi-Wan?
PADME
"Because of what you’ve done . . . what you plan to do. Stop, stop"
now. Come back! I love you.
ANAKIN
(seeing Obi-Wan) Liar!
PADME turns around and. sees OBI-WAN standing in the doorway of
the Naboo Cruiser.
PADME
No!
ANAKIN
You’re with him. You’ve betrayed me! You brought him here to kill
me!
PADME
NO! Anakin. I swear … I …
"ANAKIN reaches out, and PADME grabs her throat as she starts to"
choke.
OBI-WAN
"Let her go, Anakin."
ANAKIN
What have you and she been up to?
OBI-WAN
Let her go!
ANAKIN releases his grip on the unconscious PADME and she
crumples to the ground.
ANAKIN
You turned her against me.
OBI-WAN
You have done that yourself.
ANAKIN
You will not take her from me.
ANAKIN throws off his cloak.
OBI-WAN
Your anger and your lust for power have already done that.
OBI-WAN flings off his cloak.
OBI-WAN
(continuing) You have allowed this Dark Lord to twist your mind until
now . . . until now you have become the very thing you swore to
destroy.
They circle each other until OBI-WAN is near PADME. He places his
hand on her.
ANAKIN
"Don’t lecture me, Obi-Wan. I see through the lies of the Jedi. I do not"
"fear the dark side as you do. I have brought peace, justice, freedom,"
and security to my new Empire.
OBI-WAN
Your new Empire?
ANAKIN
Don’t make me kill you.
OBI-WAN
"Anakin, my allegiance is to the Republic … to democracy."
ANAKIN
"If you’re not with me, you’re my enemy."
OBI-WAN
Only a Sith Lord deals in absolutes. I will do what I must. (ignites his
lightsaber)
ANAKIN
You will try.
ANAKIN ignites his lightsaber.
"ANAKIN lashes out at OBI-WAN, and they begin a ferocious sword"
fight. ANAKIN throws CONTAINERS at OBI-WAN using the Force.
They work their way off the landing platform and into the main entry
"hallway. ANAKIN kicks OBI-WAN, and OBI-WAN drops to a lower"
level.
ARTOO BEEPS his concern and rushes to the unconscious
PADME’s aid.
196 INT. CORRIDOR-SENATE ARENA-CHANCELLOR’S HOLDING
OFFICE-NIGHT
"YODA enters, using the Force to throw two RED GUARDS against"
"the wall, knocking them unconscious. DARTH SIDIOUS turns his"
chair toward YODA. MAS AMEDDA stands behind SIDIOUS’s desk.
YODA
"I hear a new apprentice, you have. Emperor, or should I call you"
Darth Sidious.
DARTH SlDIOUS
"Master Yoda, you survived."
YODA
Surprised?
DARTH SlDIOUS
"Your arrogance blinds you, Master Yoda. Now you will experience the"
full power of the dark side.
"The Dark Lord raises his arms, and LIGHTNING BOLTS shoot out,"
surrounding YODA.
"YODA is picked up and thrown across the room, hitting the wall and"
sliding down in a crumpled heap. DARTH SIDIOUS chuckles.
197 INT. MUSTAFAR-PASSAGES TO MAIN CONTROL CENTERDAY
ANAKIN and OBI-WAN move their fight toward the main control
"center. As the laser swords fly, bits of the hallway are cut up. OBIWAN"
and ANAKIN jump and use every trick in the Jedi book.
198 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-NABOO CRUISERDAY
"R2-D2, tries to drag PADME on board the Naboo Cruiser. C-3PO"
pokes his head out of the ship’s doorway.
C-3PO
What are you doing? You’re going to hurt her. Wait!!
C-3PO starts down the ramp.
199 INT. CORRIDOR-SENATE ARENA-CHANCELLOR’S HOLDING
OFFICE-NIGHT
MAS AMEDDA leaves the room. PALPATINE approaches a stunned
YODA.
DARTH SlDIOUS
"I have waited a long time for this moment, my little green friend. At"
"last, the Jedi are no more."
YODA
"Not if anything I have to say about it, Lord Sidious."
"YODA uses the Force to throw DARTH SIDIOUS back, knocking him"
clear over his desk and onto the floor in a heap.
YODA
"(continuing) At an end your rule is and not short enough it was, I must"
say.
"DARTH SIDIOUS flies through the air, cape flapping, heading toward"
"the exit. At the last second, YODA flies into the exit and stops the"
Dark Lord.
YODA
"(continuing) If so powerful you are, why leave??"
YODA ignites his lightsaber.
DARTH SlDIOUS
You will not stop me. Darth Vader will become more powerful than
either of us.
DARTH SIDIOUS ignites his lightsaber.
YODA
"Faith in your new apprentice, misplaced may be, as is your faith in"
the dark side of the Force.
Their swords CLASH. The battle is extremely fast and furious.
200 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY
View screens EXPLODE around ANAKIN and OBI-WAN as they work
their way into the Control Room. The fighting is intense. OBI-WAN is
on the defensive as he jumps up on the table view screen in the
center of the room.
ANAKIN
"Don’t make me destroy you, Master. You’re no match for the dark"
side.
OBI-WAN
"I’ve heard that before, Anakin . . . but I never thought I’d hear it from"
you.
ANAKIN forces OBI-WAN back into the Conference Room where the
quarters are much closer. Sparks fly everywhere. ANAKIN jumps
"onto the conference table. OBI-WAN slides across the table,"
knocking ANAKIN over. OBI-WAN grabs ANAKIN’s lightsaber as he
falls. OBI-WAN uses the Force to summon his dropped lightsaber.
ANAKIN does the same.
201 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMBER-MAIN ARENA-NIGHT
PALPATINE seeks refuge in the vast Senate Chamber. He gets into
the Chancellor’s Podium and it starts to rise up into the Arena. YODA
makes a giant leap into the control pod. The sword fighting is intense
in the confined space.
202 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY
The battle intensifies.
OBI-WAN
(continuing) The flaw of power is arrogance.
OBI-WAN stands looking at his former apprentice for a moment.
ANAKIN
You hesitate . . . the flaw of compassion.
OBI-WAN and ANAKIN lock sabers. OBI-WAN puts out his hand to
use the Force to push ANAKIN away. ANAKIN puts out his hand to
block OBI-WAN.
Both combatants are blasted backwards onto the control panels.
They regain their footing and the battle continues. ANAKIN kicks OBIWAN
away.
"They battle around the room, and eventually the door to the exterior"
is knocked open. They continue battling out onto the balcony.
203 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMRER-MAIN ARENA-NIGHT
"YODA unleashes a ferocious assault on PALPATINE, causing him to"
almost go over the edge. The Dark Lord drops his lightsaber but
recovers with a BLAST OF ENERGY from his hands that surrounds
YODA. YODA is deflecting the Sith Lord’s lightning bolts.
The energy bolts begin to arc back on the Emperor. It looks as if the
Dark Lord is doomed.
YODA
"Destroy you I will, just as Master Kenobi, your apprentice will destroy."
YODA jumps to a lower Senate Pod. PALPATINE reaches out with
"one hand, and a Senate pod is released from its mooring and heads"
toward the Podium. PALPATINE uses the Force to hurl pod after pod
"at YODA, who ducks and jumps from one flying pod to another."
YODA leaps away from the pods. He uses the Force to hold one pod
suspended in the air. The pod spins and YODA throws it back at
"PALPATINE, who leaps away at the last moment."
"YODA leaps after him, but PALPATINE quickly turns and aims the full"
"force of his energy bolts at the tiny green Jedi, catching him in mid-air"
and throwing him back hard against the Podium. The force causes
YODA to drop his lightsaber. YODA blocks the lightning and throws
PALPATINE backwards off the podium. YODA is knocked off the
Podium and falls several hundred feet to the base of the Podium.
"PALPATINE follows in his pod, searching for YODA."
204 EXT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER BALCONY-DAY
ANAKIN forces OBI-WAN down a narrow balcony outside the Control
Room. He rips objects off the wall and throws them at OBI-WAN as
he pushes him further and further along the walkway.
"The balcony ends, and OBI-WAN is trapped. He looks over the"
balcony and into a river of lava.
"ANAKIN cuts apiece of the balcony railing off, along with a control"
panel.
"ALARMS SOUND, and a protective ray shield around the"
"superstructure disappears. It tumbles into the molten abyss,"
disappearing in a puff of smoke. A small pipe connects the Control
Center to the Main Collection Plant. OBI-WAN has no choice but to
tightrope-walk out across the lava river while fighting ANAKIN.
"205 EXT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER BALCONY, PIPE"
"ACROSS LAVA RIVER, MAIN COLLECTION PLANT-DAY"
"ANAKIN, following OBI-WAN, jumps down onto the flexing pipe,"
"lands, and resumes fighting."
206 INT. MUSTAFAR-PIPE ACROSS LAVA RIVER-DAY
"OBI-WAN and ANAKIN work their way across the small pipe, fighting"
"ferociously as they go. OBI-WAN slips, throws his lightsaber up in the"
"air, grabs on to the pipe, swings around, grabs on to an upper pipe,"
"retrieves his lightsaber, and lands back on the original pipe. They"
continue to fight across the pipe until they reach the Main Collection
Plant.
207 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-WIRING
CHUTE-NIGHT
YODA squishes his way through a mass of wires in a small chute. He
talks on his comlink.
YODA
Hurry. Careful timing we will need.
BAIL ORGANA
(in speeder) There aren’t many troops on this side. Activate your
homing beacon when you’re ready.
208 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMBER-MAIN ARENA-NIGHT
A Senate pod with COMMANDER THIRE (4477) and SEVERAL
OTHER CLONE TROOPERS climb up to where MAS AMEDDA and
"PALPATINE are waiting. Beneath the Main Podium, TWENTY"
CLONE TROOPERS search for Yoda ‘s body.
CLONE COMMANDER THIRE
"There is no sign of his body, sir."
MAS AMEDDA
Then he is not dead.
PALPATINE
Double your search.
CLONE COMMANDER THIRE
"Yes sir. Right away, sir."
PALPATINE
(to Mas Amedda) Tell Captain Kagi to prepare my shuttle for
immediate takeoff.
MAS AMEDDA
"Yes, Master."
PALPATINE
I sense Lord Vader is in danger.
PALPATINE walks into the Arena hallway. COMMANDER THIRE
"descends down to the floor of the Arena, where an intense search is"
taking place. SEVERAL CURIOUS SENATORS rubberneck in
scattered pods.
209 EXT. MUSTAFAR-COLLECTION PANELS-DAY
OBI-WAN and ANAKIN battle on the top of the multispired collection
"panels, jumping from one to the other. At the end of the collection"
"cluster, a huge spray of lava covers the attachments that hold up the"
collectors. The frame begins to melt. It’s raining lava. Both ANAKIN
and OBI-WAN run for cover under the collection cluster. They
"continue to fight in the lava rain, darting from cover to attack, then"
quickly retreating to cover.
"Support for the entire structure begins to fall away, and the collection"
"cluster falls into the lava river. The Jedi continue their fight, climbing"
to the highest point on the tower as the rest begins to melt away as it
rides the swift current down the river.
It bends toward the lava as they get out toward the end. The fighting
gets fierce. OBI-WAN gets to the end and is trapped. The tower
slowly starts to sink under the lava.
210 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-NIGHT
"BAIL ORGANA, in his open Cockpit Speeder, flies along next to the"
roof eave of the huge Senate Building. He slows and moves closer to
a long row of recessed lights. Suddenly YODA falls out of one of the
light recesses and lands in the Speeder. BAIL guns it and heads
away from the Senate Building.
211 INT. CORUSCANT-BAIL ORGANA’S SPEEDER-NIGHT
YODA straightens himself out.
YODA
"Into exile I must go. Failed, I have."
YODA and BAIL fly into the traffic of the city.
212 EXT. MUSTAFAR-COLLECTION PANELS-DAY
OBI-WAN realizes he is getting very close to the edge of the lava
falls. He grabs a rope and leaps from the collection arm. ANAKIN
follows.
ANAKIN and OBI-WAN continue their sword fight hanging from
cables as they swing past each other.
213 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-NABOO SKIFF-DAY
C-3PO carefully lifts PADME into his arms. R2-D2 nervously looks
on. BEEPING.
C-3PO
"I am being careful. I’ve got a good hold on her, but . . . I’m worried"
about my back. I hope it’s able to hold up under this weight.
C-3PO carries PADME into the Naboo Skiff.
214 EXT. MUSTAFAR-COLLECTION PANELS-DAY
"From their cables, ANAKIN and OBI-WAN both spot something that"
causes them to stop fighting. The lava river ahead drops off in a
tremendous lava fall.
SNAPPING AND METAL GROANS are heard as the main part of the
collector starts to break away and move toward the lava fall. OBIWAN
looks around and sees a small floating platform making its way
toward the tower.
OBI-WAN does a double hack-flip and lands squarely on the floating
platform. He immediately leans to one side and moves away from the
tower.
ANAKIN realizes he is doomed as the entire tower heads for the falls.
In the distance he sees some CONSTRUCTION DROIDS. He swings
"back to the tower, climbs up and makes a running leap and"
miraculously lands on A WORKER DROID. The DROID is confused
and chatters to his CO-WORKER. The giant collector goes over the
lava flow and disappears in the mist of sparks below.
"OBI-WAN heads for the bank of the lava river, but Anakin’s DROID is"
faster. He catches up with his old Master.
"OBI-WAN and ANAKIN continue the swordfight. They battle away,"
"balancing on the tiny platform and puzzled DROID. ANAKIN, standing"
"on the Droid, approaches OBI-WAN on the work platform."
OBI-WAN
"I have failed you, Anakin. I was never able to teach you to think."
ANAKIN and OBI-WAN confront each other on the lava river.
ANAKIN
I should have known the Jedi were plotting to take over . . .
OBI-WAN
"From the Sith!!! Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil."
ANAKIN
"From the Jedi point of view! From my point of view, the Jedi are evil."
OBI-WAN
"Well, then you are lost!"
ANAKIN
"This is the end for you, My Master. I wish it were otherwise."
ANAKIN jumps and flips onto OBI- WAN’s platform. The fighting
continues again until OBI-WAN jumps toward the safety of the black
sandy edge of the lava river. He yells at Anakin.
OBI-WAN
"It’s over, Anakin. I have the high ground."
ANAKIN
You underestimate my power!
OBI-WAN
Don’t try it.
"ANAKIN follows, and OBI-WAN cuts his young apprentice at the"
"knees, then cuts off his left arm in the blink of an eye. ANAKIN"
tumbles down the embankment and rolls to a stop near the edge of
the lava.
ANAKIN struggles to pull himself up the embankment with his
mechanical hand. His thin leather glove has been burned off. He
keeps sliding down in the black sand.
OBI-WAN
(continuing) . . . You were the Chosen One! It was said that you
"would, destroy the Sith, not join them. It was you who would bring"
"balance to the Force, not leave it in Darkness."
OBI-WAN picks up Anakin’s light saber and begins to walk away. He
stops and looks back.
ANAKIN
I hate you!
OBI-WAN
"You were my brother, Anakin. I loved you."
ANAKIN’S clothing blows into the lava river and ignites. Suddenly
ANAKIN bursts into flames and starts SCREAMING.
215 INT. MUSTAFAR-VOLCANO EDGE-DAY
OBI-WAN looks in horror as ANAKIN becomes engulfed in flames.
"OBI-WAN can’t watch him as he struggles to climb the embankment,"
covered in flames.
"He runs back to Padme’s ship as ANAKIN drops, smoldering, near"
the top of the lava pit.
216 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-NABOO SKIFF-DAY
OBI-WAN makes his way to the SKIFF. He looks for Padme.
THREEPIO sticks his head out the door of the SKIFF.
C-3PO
"Master Kenobi! We have Miss Padme on board. Please, please"
hurry. We should leave this dreadful place.
OBI-WAN runs on board the Naboo Skiff.
217 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-NABOO SKIFF-DAY
PADME lies on a cot or bed inside the ship. OBI-WAN walks over and
checks on her.
PADME
Obi-Wan? Is Anakin all right?
OBI-WAN looks at her sadly and does not answer. He brushes her
hair back. Padme drops back into unconsciousness. ARTOO watches
over her.
OBI-WAN rides in the co-pilot’s station. He sits looking pensive.
THREEPIO drives.
218 EXT. MUSTAFAR-VOLCANO EDGE-DAY
"ANAKIN crawls up the bank, his body smoking. A shuttle flies"
overhead and lands.
219 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-IMPERIAL SHUTTLEDAY
An Imperial Shuttle closes its wings and settles on the highest of the
Mustafar Landing Platforms. A PLATOON OF CLONE TROOPERS
"exits the craft, followed by DARTH SIDIOUS."
220 INT. MUSTAFAR-VOLCANO PIT-DAY
DARTH SIDIOUS walks in front of the CLONE TROOPERS on his
way to get to Anakin at the edge of the lava pit.
221 EXT. MUSTAFAR-VOLCANO PIT-DAY
DARTH SIDIOUS discovers what remains of ANAKIN and checks
him out. He turns to the CLONES.
DARTH SIDIOUS
"Anakin! Anakin! There he is. He’s still alive. Get a medical capsule,"
immediately.
CLONE CAPTAIN
Yes sir. Right away.
Several of the CLONES rush off as DARTH SIDlOUS puts his hand
on ANAKIN’s forehead.
222 INT. POLIS MASSA-OBSERVATION DOME-NIGHT
"On the isolated asteroid of Polis Massa, YODA meditates."
YODA
"Failed to stop the Sith Lord, I have. Still much to learn, there is …"
QUI -GON
(V.O.) Patience. You will have time. I did not. When I became one
"with the Force I made a great discovery. With my training, you will be"
"able to merge with the Force at will. Your physical self will fade away,"
but you will still retain your consciousness. You will become more
powerful than any Sith.
YODA
Eternal consciousness.

"(V.O.) The ability to defy oblivion can be achieved, but only for"
oneself. It was accomplished by a Shaman of the Whills. It is a state
"acquired through compassion, not greed."

"power greater than all, it is."
QUI-GON

YODA
"A great Jedi Master, you have become, Qui-Gon Jinn. Your"

"YODA thinks about this for a minute, then BAIL ORGANA enters the"
room and breaks his meditation.
BAIL ORGANA
"Excuse me, Master Yoda. Obi-Wan Kenobi has made contact."
223 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY
The CLONES have placed ANAKIN in a medical capsule. They float
the wounded Sith Lord into the belly of the IMPERIAL CRUISER.
DARTH SIDIOUS follows the capsule into the ship. The ship takes
off.

OBI-WAN lands the Naboo Cruiser on the landing platform of the
"isolated post of Polis Massa. YODA and BAIL ORGANA, along with a"
"FEW GROUND CREW, are waiting as the ramp lowers and OBIWAN"
"emerges, carrying the unconscious PADME in his arms,"
followed by ARTOO and THREEPIO.
BAIL ORGANA
"We’ll take her to the medical center, quickly."

"POLIS MEDICS work, on PADME in an operating theater. OBI-WAN"
and one of the MEDICAL DROIDS enter an observation room where
BAIL and YODA are waiting.
MEDICAL DROID
"Medically, she is completely healthy. For reasons we can’t explain,"
we are losing her.
OBI-WAN
She’s dying?
MEDICAL DROID
We don’t know why. She has lost the will to live. We need to operate
quickly if we are to save the babies.
BAIL ORGANA
Babies??!!
MEDICAL DROID
She’s carrying twins.
YODA
"Save them, we must. They are our last hope."
The MEDICAL DROID rushes back to the operating room. ARTOO
"and THREEPIO watch, greatly puzzled. ARTOO BEEPS."
C-3PO
"It s some kind of reproductive process, I think."
227 INT. CORUSCANT-IMPERIAL REHAB CENTER-DAY
"ANAKIN, in the medical capsule, is lifted onto a table in the Rehab"
Center. DROIDS go to work on him. ANAKIN has new legs and a
new arm.

"The TWINS are being delivered as BAIL ORGANA, YODA, ARTOO,"
and THREEPIO watch. OBI-WAN is in the operating theater with
PADME. He takes her hand.
OBI-WAN
"Don’t give up, Padme."
PADME winces from the pain. The MEDICAL DROID is holding the
BABY.
MEDICAL DROID
It’s a boy.
PADME
Luke . . .
PADME can only offer up a faint smile. She struggles to touch the
baby on the forehead.
MEDICAL DROID

"plugs are inserted and the mask drops from above, sealing tightly."
The helmet is fitted and VADER begins breathing.
230 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-NIGHT
OBI WAN leans over PADME and softly speaks to her.
OBI-WAN
"You have twins, Padme They need you . . . hang on."
PADME
I can’t . . .
PADME winces again and takes OBI-WAN’s hand. She is holding
Anakin’s japor snippet.
OBI-WAN
Save your energy.
PADME
Obi-Wan . . . there . . . is good in him. I know there is … still . . .
"A last gasp, and she dies. Obi-Wan studies the necklace."
231 INT. CORUSCANT-IMPERIAL REHAB CENTER-DAY
DARTH SIDIOUS hovers around the periphery of a group of
MEDICAL DROIDS who are working on ANAKIN. DARTH SIDIOUS
paces in the foreground. A DROID approaches the Dark Lord.
MEDICAL DROID
"My Lord, the construction is finished … he lives."
DARTH SIDIOUS
Good. Good.
The DROID moves back to the table where DARTH VADER lies. The
table begins to move upright. DARTH SIDIOUS moves in next to
DARTH VADER.
DARTH SIDIOUS
"(continuing) Lord Vader, can you hear me?"
"DARTH VADER, with his dark mask and helmet, moves up into the"
frame until he is in a CLOSEUP.
DARTH VADER
"Yes, My Master."
DARTH VADER looks around the room.
DARTH VADER
"(continuing) Where is Padme? Is she safe, is she all right?"
DARTH SIDIOUS moves closer to the half droid/half man.
DARTH SIDIOUS
"I’m afraid she died. … it seems in your anger, you killed her."
A LOW GROAN emanates from Vader’s mask. Suddenly everything
"in the room begins to implode, including some of the DROIDS."
DARTH VADER
I couldn’t have! She was alive! I felt her! She was alive! It’s
impossible! No!!!
"VADER SCREAMS, breaks his bonds to the table, and steps forward,"
"waving his hands, causing objects to fly around the room. SIDIOUS"
"deflects the objects, but some of the DROIDS aren’t so lucky."
VADER’S PAINFUL SCREAMS echo throughout the Center.

BAIL ORGANA’s Starcruiser approaches the city of Theed.
233 INT. ALDERAAN CRUISER-CONFERENCE ROOM
"BAIL ORGANA, YODA, and OBI-WAN sit around a conference table."
YODA
"Pregnant, she must still appear. Hidden, safe, the children must be"
kept.
OBI-WAN
We must take them somewhere the Sith will not sense their
presence.
YODA
"Split up, they should be."
BAIL ORGANA
My wife and I will take the girl. We’ve always talked of adopting a
baby girl. She will be loved with us.
OBI-WAN
And what of the boy?
YODA
"To Tatooine. To his family, send him."
OBI-WAN
"I will take the child and watch over him. Master Yoda, do you think"
Anakin’s twins will be able to defeat Darth Sidious?
YODA
"Strong the Force runs, in the Skywalker line. Hope, we can . . . Done,"
"it is. Until the time is right, disappear we will."
BAIL leaves the conference room. YODA stops OBI-WAN.
YODA
"(continuing) Master Kenobi, wait a moment. In your solitude on"
"Tatooine, training I have for you."
OBI-WAN
Training??
YODA
An old friend has learned the path to immortality.
OBI-WAN
Who?
YODA
One who has returned from the netherworld of the Force to train me .
". . your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn."
OBI-WAN
"Qui-Gon? But, how could he accomplish this?"
YODA
"The secret of the Ancient Order of the Whills, he studied. How to"
commune with him. I will teach you.
OBI-WAN
I will be able to talk with him?
YODA
"How to join the Force, he will train you. Your consciousness you will"
"retain, when one with the Force. Even your physical self, perhaps."
234 INT. ALDERAAN STARCRUISER-HALLWAY- SPACE
"BAIL ORGANA, followed by ARTOO and THREEPIO, approaches"
CAPTAIN ANTILLES and TWO CREW MEMBERS.
BAIL ORGANA
Captain Antilles.
CAPTAIN ANTILLES
"Yes, Your Highness."
BAIL ORGANA
I’m placing these droids in your care. Treat them well. Clean them up.
Have the Protocol Droid’s mind wiped.
C-3PO
"Oh, no."

The QUEEN OF ALDERAAN sits on a balcony looking out over the
awesome mountains of Alderaan. BAIL ORGANA brings a small baby
to her. She takes her and rocks her.
240 EXT. TATOOINE-SUNSET
OBI-WAN rides up to the moisture farm homestead on an EOPIE. He
"dismounts, takes the BABY out of a papoose on his back, and walks"
"toward AUNT BERU, who walks over to greet him. They talk for a"
"moment, and OBI-WAN turns the baby over to the young"
homesteader. AUNT BERU walks to UNCLE OWEN who is standing
"on the ridge near the homestead. OBI-WAN leaves as OWEN,"
"BERU, and the BABY watch the twin suns set."
END TITLES.
STAR WARS
"“A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away…”"
A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title. War
drums echo through the heavens as a rollup slowly crawls into
infinity.
"“It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a"
"hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic"
Empire.
"During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the"
"Empire’s ultimate weapon, the Death Star, an armored space station"
with enough power to destroy an entire planet.
"Pursued by the Empire’s sinister agents, Princess Leia races home"
"aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her"
people and restore freedom to the galaxy…”
"The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total eclipse,"
"her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tiny silver spacecraft,"
"a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers from the back of the ship,"
races through space. It is pursed by a giant Imperial Star Destroyer.
Hundreds of deadly laserbolts streak from the Imperial Star
"Destroyer, causing the main solar fin of the Rebel craft to"
disintegrate. INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER – MAIN
PASSAGEWAY
"An explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2-D2) and"
See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their way through the
"shaking, bouncing passageway. Both robots are old and battered."
"Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. His face is a mass of computer"
"lights surrounding a radar eye. Threepio, on the other hand, is a tall,"
slender robot of human proportions. He has a gleaming bronze-like
metallic surface of an Art Deco design.
Another blast shakes them as they struggle along their way.
THREEPIO Did you hear that? They’ve shut down the main reactor.
We’ll be destroyed for sure. This is madness!
Rebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions in the main
passageway. They aim their weapons toward the door.
THREEPIO We’re doomed!
The little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that only
another robot could understand.
THREEPIO There’ll be no escape for the Princess this time.
Artoo continues making beeping sounds. Tension mounts as loud
metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment are heard
moving around the outside hull of the ship.
THREEPIO What’s that? EXT. SPACECRAFT IN SPACE
The Imperial craft has easily overtaken the Rebel Blockade Runner.
The smaller Rebel ship is being drawn into the underside dock of the
giant Imperial starship. INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER
The nervous Rebel troopers aim their weapons. Suddenly a
tremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and a
score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make their
way into the smoke-filled corridor.
In a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with laserfire. The
deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns creating huge
explosions. Stormtroopers scatter and duck behind storage lockers.
Laserbolts hit several Rebel soldiers who scream and stagger
"through the smoke, holding shattered arms and faces."
An explosion hits near the robots.
THREEPIO I should have known better than to trust the logic of a
half-sized thermocapsulary dehousing assister…
Artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages around the
two hapless robots. EXT. TATOOINE – DESERT WASTELAND –
DAY
A death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon. The
"tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone figure, Luke"
"Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations who looks much"
younger than his eighteen years. His shaggy hair and baggy tunic
give him the air of a simple but lovable lad with a prize-winning smile.
A light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a large
battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the desert floor much
like an oil pipe with valves. He is aided by a beatup tread-robot with
six claw arms. The little robot appears to be barely functioning and
moves with jerky motions. A bright sparkle in the morning sky catches
Luke’s eye and he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from
his utility belt. He stands transfixed for a few moments studying the
"heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repaired"
Landspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few feet above the
ground on a magnetic-field). He motions for the tiny robot to follow
him.
LUKE Hurry up! Come with me! What are you waiting for?! Get in
gear!
"The robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and smoke"
begins to pour out of every joint. Luke throws his arms up in disgust.
"Exasperated, the young farm boy jumps into his Landspeeder leaving"
the smoldering robot to hum madly. INT. REBEL BLOCKADE
RUNNER – MAIN HALLWAY
"The awesome, seven-foot-tall Dark Lord of the Sith makes his way"
"into the blinding light of the main passageway. This is Darth Vader,"
right hand of the Emperor. His face is obscured by his flowing black
"robes and grotesque breath mask, which stands out next to the"
fascist white armored suits of the Imperial stormtroopers.
Everyone instinctively backs away from the imposing warrior and a
deathly quiet sweeps through the Rebel troops. Several of the Rebel
troops break and run in a frenzied panic. INT. REBEL BLOCKADE
RUNNER
A woman’s hand puts a card into an opening in Artoo’s dome. Artoo
makes beeping sounds. INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER
"Threepio stands in a hallway, somewhat bewildered. Artoo is"
nowhere in sight. The pitiful screams of the doomed Rebel soldiers
can be heard in the distance.
"THREEPIO Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?"
A familiar clanking sound attacks Threepio’s attention and he spots
little Artoo at the end of the hallway in a smoke-filled alcove. A
beautiful young girl (about sixteen years old) stands in front of Artoo.
"Surreal and out of place, dreamlike and half hidden in the smoke, she"
"finishes adjusting something on Artoo’s computer face, then watches"
as the little robot joins his companion.
THREEPIO At last! Where have you been?
Stormtroopers can be heard battling in the distance.
THREEPIO They’re heading in this direction. What are we going to
do? We’ll be sent to the spice mines of Kessel or smashed into who
knows what!
Artoo scoots past his bronze friend and races down the subhallway.
Threepio chases after him.
"THREEPIO Wait a minute, where are you going?"
Artoo responds with electronic beeps. INT. REBEL BLOCKADE
RUNNER – CORRIDOR
The evil Darth Vader stands amid the broken and twisted bodies of
his foes. He grabs a wounded Rebel Officer by the neck as an
Imperial Officer rushes up to the Dark Lord.
IMPERIAL OFFICER The Death Star plans are not in the main
computer.
"Vader squeezes the neck of the Rebel Officer, who struggles in vain."
VADER Where are those transmissions you intercepted? [What have
you done with those plans?]
Vader lifts the Rebel off his feet by his throat.
REBEL OFFICER We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah… This is a
consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission.
VADER If this is a consular ship… where is the Ambassador?
The Rebel refuses to speak but eventually cries out as the Dark Lord
"begins to squeeze the officer’s throat, creating a gruesome snapping"
"and choking, until the soldier goes limp. Vader tosses the dead"
soldier against the wall and turns to his troops.
"VADER Commander, tear this ship apart until you’ve found those"
plans and bring me the Ambassador. I want her alive!
The stormtroopers scurry into the subhallways. INT. REBEL
BLOCKADE RUNNER – SUBHALLWAY
The lovely young girl huddles in a small alcove as the stormtroopers
"search through the ship. She is Princess Leia Organa, a member of"
the Alderaan Senate. The fear in her eyes slowly gives way to anger
as the muted crushing sounds of the approaching stormtroopers grow
louder. One of the troopers spots her.
TROOPER There she is! Set for stun!
Leia steps from her hiding place and blasts a trooper with her laser
pistol. She starts to run but is felled by a paralyzing ray. The troopers
inspect her inert body.
TROOPER She’ll be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a
prisoner. INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER – SUBHALLWAY
Artoo stops before the small hatch of an emergency lifepod. He
snaps the seal on the main latch and a red warning light begins to
flash. The stubby astro-robot works his way into the cramped fourman
pod.
"THREEPIO Hey, you’re not permitted in there. It’s restricted. You’ll"
be deactivated for sure..
Artoo beeps something to him.
"THREEPIO Don’t call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight"
glob of grease! Now come out before somebody sees you.
Artoo whistles something at his reluctant friend regarding the mission
he is about to perform.
THREEPIO Secret mission? What plans? What are you talking
about? I’m not getting in there!
"Artoo isn’t happy with Threepio’s stubbornness, and he beeps and"
twangs angrily.
"A new explosion, this time very close, sends dust and debris through"
"the narrow subhallway. Flames lick at Threepio and, after a flurry of"
"electronic swearing from Artoo, the lanky robot jumps into the lifepod."
THREEPIO I’m going to regret this. INT. REBEL BLOCKADE
RUNNER
"The safety door snaps shut, and with the thunder of exploding latches"
the tiny lifepod ejects from the disabled ship. INT. IMPERIAL STAR

Artoo and Threepio look out at the receding Imperial starship. Stars
circle as the pod rotates through the galaxy.

THREEPIO Are you sure this things safe? EXT. TATOOINE –
ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT – POWER STATION – DAY
Heat waves radiate from the dozen or so bleached white buildings.
Luke pilots his Landspeeder through the dusty empty street of the tiny
settlement. An old woman runs to get out of the way of the speeding
"vehicle, shaking her fist at Luke as he flies past."
WOMAN I’ve told you kids to slow down!
Luke pulls up behind a low concrete service station that is all but
covered by the shifting desert sands. INT. POWER STATION – DAY
"Luke bursts into the power station, waking The Fixer, a rugged"
"mechanic and Camie, a sexy, disheveled girl who has been asleep in"
"his lap. They grumbled as he races through the office, yelling wildly."
FIXER Did I hear a young noise blast through here?
CAMIE It was just Wormie on another rampage.
Luke bounces into a small room behind the office where Deak and
"Windy, two tough boys about the same age as Luke, are playing a"
"computer pool-like game with Biggs, a burly, handsome boy a few"
years older than the rest. His flashy city attire is a sharp contrast to
the loose-fitting tunics of the farm boys. A robot repairs some
equipment in the background.
LUKE Shape it up you guys!… Biggs?
Luke’s surprise at the appearance of Biggs gives way to great joy and
emotion. They give each other a great bear hug.
LUKE I didn’t know you were back! When did you get in?
"BIGGS Just now. I wanted to surprise you, hot shot. I thought you’d"
be here… certainly didn’t expect you to be out working. (laughs)
LUKE The Academy didn’t change you much… but you’re back so
"soon? Hey, what happened, didn’t you get your commission?"
Biggs has an air of cool that seems slightly phony.
BIGGS Of course I got it. Signed aboard The Rand Ecliptic last
week. First mate Biggs Darklighter at your service… (he salutes) … I
just came back to say goodbye to all you unfortunate
landlocked simpletons.
Everyone laughs. The dazzling spectacle of his dashing friend is
"almost too much for Luke, but suddenly he snaps out of it."
LUKE I almost forgot. There’s a battle going on! Right here in our
system. Come and look!
DEAK Not again! Forget it. EXT. TATOOINE – ANCHORHEAD –
SETTLEMENT – POWER STATION – DAY
The group stumbles out into the stifling desert sun. Camie and The
Fixer complain and are forced to shade their eyes. Luke has his
binoculars out scanning the heavens.
LUKE There they are!
Biggs takes the electrobinoculars from Luke as the others strain to
see something with the naked eye. Through the electrobinoculars
Biggs sees two small silver specks.
"BIGGS That’s no battle, hot shot… they’re just sitting there! Probably"
a freighter-tanker refueling.
LUKE But there was a lot of firing earlier…
Camie grabs the electrobinoculars away banging them against the
building in the process. Luke grabs them.
"LUKE Hey, easy with those…"
"CAMIE Don’t worry about it, Wormie."
The Fixer gives Luke a hard look and the young farm boy shrugs his
shoulders in resignation.
"FIXER I keep telling you, the Rebellion is a long way from here. I"
doubt if the Empire would even fight to keep this system. Believe me
"Luke, this planet is a big hunk of nothing…"
"Luke agrees, although it’s obvious he isn’t sure why. The group"
"stumbles back into the power station, grumbling about Luke’s"
ineptitude. INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER – HALLWAY
Princess Leia is led down a low-ceilinged hallway by a squad of
armored stormtroopers. Her hands are bound and she is brutally
shoved when she is unable to keep up with the briskly marching
troops. They stop in a smoky hallway as Darth Vader emerges from
the shadows. The sinister Dark Lord stares hard at the frail young
"senator, but she doesn’t move."
"LEIA Lord Vader, I should have known. Only you could be so bold."
"The Imperial Senate will not sit still for this, when they hear"
you’ve attacked a diplomatic…
"VADER Don’t play games with me, Your Highness. You weren’t on"
any mercy mission this time. You passed directly through a
restricted system. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by
Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent
you.
LEIA I don’t know what you’re talking about. I’m a member of the
Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan…
VADER You’re a part of the Rebel Alliance … and a traitor. Take her
away!
Leia is marched away down the hallway and into the smoldering hole
blasted in the side of the ship. An Imperial Commander turns to
Vader.
"COMMANDER Holding her is dangerous. If word of this gets out, it"
could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate.
VADER I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only
link to find their secret base!
COMMANDER She’ll die before she’ll tell you anything.
VADER Leave that to me. Send a distress signal and then inform the
senate that all aboard were killed!
Another Imperial Officer approaches Vader and the Commander.
They stop and snap to attention.
"SECOND OFFICER Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not"
aboard this ship! And no transmissions were made. An escape pod
"was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard."
Vader turns to the Commander.
VADER She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a
"detachment down to retrieve them. See to it personally, Commander."
There’ll be no one to stop us this time.
"COMMANDER Yes, sir. EXT. SPACE"
The Imperial Star Destroyer comes over the surface of the planet
Tatooine. EXT. TATOOINE – DESERT
"Jundland, or “No Man’s Land”, where the rugged desert mesas meet"
the foreboding dune sea. The two helpless astro-robots kick up
clouds of sand as they leave the lifepod and clumsily work their way
across the desert wasteland. The lifepod in the distance rests half
buried in the sand.
THREEPIO How did I get into this mess? I really don’t know how. We
seem to be made to suffer. It’s our lot in life.
Artoo answers with beeping sounds.
THREEPIO I’ve got to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost
frozen.
Artoo continues to respond with beeping sounds.
THREEPIO What a desolate place this is.
"Suddenly Artoo whistles, makes a sharp right turn and starts off in the"
direction of the rocky desert mesas. Threepio stops and yells at him.
THREEPIO Where are you going?
A stream of electronic noises pours forth from the small robot.
"THREEPIO Well, I’m not going that way. It’s much too rocky. This"
way is much easier.
Artoo counters with a long whistle.
THREEPIO What makes you think there are settlements over there?
Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.
THREEPIO Don’t get technical with me.
Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.
THREEPIO What mission? What are you talking about? I’ve had just
about enough of you! Go that way! You’ll be malfunctioning within a
"day, you nearsighted scrap pile!"
Threepio gives the little robot a kick and starts off in the direction of
the vast dune sea.
"THREEPIO And don’t let me catch you following me begging for help,"
because you won’t get it.
Artoo’s reply is a rather rude sound. He turns and trudges off in the
direction of the towering mesas.
THREEPIO No more adventures. I’m not going that way.
Artoo beeps to himself as he makes his way toward the distant
mountains. EXT. TATOOINE – DUNE SEA
"Threepio, hot and tired, struggles up over the ridge of a dune: only to"
"find more dunes, which seem to go on for endless miles. He looks"
back in the direction of the now distant rock mesas.
THREEPIO That malfunctioning little twerp. This is all his fault! He
"tricked me into going this way, but he’ll do no better."
"In a huff of anger and frustration, Threepio knocks the sand from his"
"joints. His plight seems hopeless, when a glint of reflected light in the"
distance reveals an object moving towards him.
"THREEPIO Wait, what’s that? A transport! I’m saved!"
The bronze android waves frantically and yells at the approaching
transport.
"THREEPIO Over here! Help! Please, help!"

Luke and Biggs are walking and drinking a malt brew. Fixer and the
others can be heard working inside.
"LUKE (Very animated) … so I cut off my power, shut down the"
afterburners and came in low on Deak’s trail. I was so close I thought
I was going to fry my instruments. As it was I busted up the
Skyhopper pretty bad. Uncle Owen was pretty upset. He
grounded me for the rest of the season. You should have been
there… it was fantastic.
BIGGS You ought to take it a little easy Luke. You may be the
"hottest bushpilot this side of Mos Eisley, but those little Skyhoppers"
"are dangerous. Keep it up, and one day, whammo, you’re going to be"
nothing more than a dark spot on the down side of a canyon wall.
LUKE Look who’s talking. Now that you’ve been around those
giant starships you’re beginning to sound like my uncle. You’ve
gotten soft in the city…
BIGGS I’ve missed you kid.
"LUKE Well, things haven’t been the same since you left, Biggs. It’s"
been so…quiet.
Biggs looks around then leans close to Luke.
"BIGGS Luke, I didn’t come back just to say goodbye… I shouldn’t"
"tell you this, but you’re the only one I can trust… and if I don’t"
"come back, I want somebody to know."
Luke’s eyes are wide with Biggs’ seriousness and loyalty.
LUKE What are you talking about?
BIGGS I made some friends at the Academy. (he whispers) … when
"our frigate goes to one of the central systems, we’re going to jump"
ship and join the Alliance…
"Luke, amazed and stunned, is almost speechless."
LUKE Join the Rebellion?! Are you kidding! How?
BIGGS Quiet down will ya! You got a mouth bigger than a meteor
crater!
LUKE I’m sorry. I’m quiet. (he whispers) Listen how quiet I am. You
can barely hear me…
Biggs shakes his head angrily and then continues.
BIGGS My friend has a friend on Bestine who might help us make
contact.
LUKE You’re crazy! You could wander around forever trying to find
them.
"BIGGS I know it’s a long shot, but if I don’t find them I’ll do what I can"
"on my own… It’s what we always talked about. Luke, I’m not going to"
wait for the Empire to draft me into service. The Rebellion is
spreading and I want to be on the right side – the side I believe in.
LUKE And I’m stuck here…
BIGGS I thought you were going to the Academy next term. You’ll get
your chance to get off this rock.
LUKE Not likely! I had to cancel my application. There has been a
lot of unrest among the Sand People since you left… they’ve even
raided the outskirts of Anchorhead.
BIGGS Your uncle could hold off a whole colony of Sand People with
one blaster.
"LUKE I know, but he’s got enough vaporators going to make the"
place pay off. He needs me for just one more season. I can’t leave
him now.
"BIGGS I feel for you, Luke, you’re going to have to learn what seems"
to be important or what really is important. What good is all your
uncle’s work if it’s taken over by the Empire?… You know they’re
starting to nationalize commerce in the central systems… it won’t be
"long before your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving for the greater glory"
of the Empire.
LUKE It couldn’t happen here. You said it yourself. The Empire won’t
bother with this rock.
BIGGS Things always change.
LUKE I wish I was going… Are you going to be around long?
"BIGGS No, I’m leaving in the morning…"
LUKE Then I guess I won’t see you.
BIGGS Maybe someday… I’ll keep a lookout.
"LUKE Well, I’ll be at the Academy next season… after that who"
knows. I won’t be drafted into the Imperial Starfleet that’s for sure…
"Take care of yourself, you’ll always be the best friend I’ve got."
"BIGGS So long, Luke."
Biggs turns away from his old friend and heads back towards the
power station. EXT. TATOOINE – ROCK CANYON – SUNSET
The gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strange foreboding
mist and the ominous sounds of unearthly creatures fill the air. Artoo
"moves cautiously through the creepy rock canyon, inadvertently"
"making a loud clicking noise as he goes. He hears a distant, hard,"
"metallic sound and stops for a moment. Convinced he is alone, he"
continues on his way.
"In the distance, a pebble tumbles down the steep canyon wall and a"
small dark figure darts into the shadows. A little further up the canyon
a slight flicker of light reveals a pair of eyes in the dark recesses only
a few feet from the narrow path.
"The unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail until suddenly,"
"out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray shoots out of the rocks and"
engulfs him in an eerie glow.
He manages one short electronic squeak before he topples over onto
"his back. His bright computer lights flicker off, then on, then off again."
"Out of the rocks scurry three Jawas, no taller than Artoo. They holster"
strange and complex weapons as they cautiously approach the robot.
They wear grubby cloaks and their faces are shrouded so that only
their glowing yellow eyes can be seen. They hiss and make odd
guttural sounds as they heave the heavy robot onto their shoulders
and carry him off down the trail. EXT. TATOOINE – ROCK CANYON
– SANDCRAWLER – SUNSET
The eight Jawas carry Artoo out of the canyon to a huge tank-like
vehicle the size of a four-story house. They weld a small disk on the
side of Artoo and then put him under a large tube on the side of the
vehicle and the little robot is sucked into the giant machine.
The filthy little Jawas scurry like rats up small ladders and enter the
main cabin of the behemoth transport. INT. SANDCRAWLER –
HOLD AREA
It is dim inside the hold area of the Sandcrawler. Artoo switches on a
small floodlight on his forehead and stumbles around the scrap heap.
The narrow beam swings across rusty metal rocket parts and an
array of grotesquely twisted and maimed astro-robots. He lets out a
pathetic electronic whimper and stumbles off toward what appears to
be a door at the end of the chamber. INT. SANDCRAWLER –
PRISON AREA
Artoo enters a wide room with a four-foot ceiling. In the middle of the
scrap heap sit a dozen or so robots of various shapes and sizes.
"Some are engaged in electronic conversation, while others simply mill"
about. A voice of recognition calls out from the gloom.
THREEPIO Artoo-Detoo! It’s you! It’s you!
A battered Threepio scrambles up to Artoo and embraces him. EXT.
TATOOINE – ROCK CANYON – SANDCRAWLER – SUNSET
The enormous Sandcrawler lumbers off toward the magnificent twin
"suns, which are slowly setting over a distant mountain ridge. EXT."
TATOOINE – DESERT – DAY
Four Imperial stormtroopers mill about in front of the half buried
lifepod that brought Artoo and Threepio to Tatooine. A trooper yells to
an officer some distance away.
FIRST TROOPER Someone was in the pod. The tracks go off in this
direction.
A second trooper picks up a small bit of metal out of the sand and
gives it to the first trooper.
"SECOND TROOPER Look, sir – droids. EXT. TATOOINE – DUNES"
The Sandcrawler moves slowly down a great sand dune. INT.
SANDCRAWLER
Threepio and Artoo noisily bounce along inside the cramped prison
chamber. Artoo appears to be shut off.
THREEPIO Wake up! Wake up!
"Suddenly the shaking and bouncing of the Sandcrawler stops,"
creating quite a commotion among the mechanical men. Threepio’s
fist bangs the head of Artoo whose computer lights pop on as he
"begins beeping. At the far end of the long chamber a hatch opens,"
filling the chamber with blinding white light. a dozen or so Jawas
make their way through the odd assortment of robots.
THREEPIO We’re doomed.
A Jawa starts moving toward them.
THREEPIO Do you think they’ll melt us down?
"Artoo responds, making beeping sounds."
THREEPIO Don’t shoot! Don’t shoot! Will this never end? EXT.
TATOOINE – DESERT – LARS HOMESTEAD – AFTERNOON
The Jawas mutter gibberish as they busily line up their battered
"captives, including Artoo and Threepio, in front of the enormous"
"Sandcrawler, which is parked beside a small homestead consisting of"
three large holes in the ground surrounded by several tall moisture
vaporators and one small adobe block house.
"The Jawas scurry around fussing over the robots, straightening them"
up or brushing some dust from a dented metallic elbow. The
"shrouded little creatures smell horribly, attracting small insects to the"
dark areas when their mouths and nostrils should be.
"Out of the shadows of a dingy side-building limps Owen Lars, a large"
burly man in his mid-fifties. His reddish eyes are sunken in a dustcovered
"face. As the farmer carefully inspects each of the robots, he"
"is closely followed by his slump-shouldered nephew, Luke Skywalker."
One of the vile little Jawas walks ahead of the farmer spouting an
"animated sales pitch in a queer, unintelligible language."
A voice calls out from one of the huge holes that form the homestead.
Luke goes over to the edge and sees his Aunt Beru standing in the
main courtyard.
"BERU Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it"
speaks Bocce.
LUKE It looks like we don’t have much of a choice but I’ll remind him.
Luke returns to his uncle as they look over the equipment for sale
with the Jawa leader.
OWEN I have no need for a protocol droid.
THREEPIO (quickly) Sir – not in an environment such as this – that’s
why I’ve also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions
that…
OWEN What I really need is a droid that understands the
binary languages of moisture vaporators.
THREEPIO Vaporators! Sir – My first job was programming binary
load lifters … very similar to your vaporators. You could say…
OWEN Do you speak Bocce?
"THREEPIO Of course I can, sir. It’s like a second language for me…"
I’m as fluent in Bocce…
OWEN All right; shut up! (turning to Jawa) I’ll take this one.
"THREEPIO Shutting up, sir."
"OWEN Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you? I want you"
to have both of them cleaned up before dinner.
LUKE But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power
converters…
OWEN You can waste time with your friends when your chores
"are done. Now, come on, get to it!"
"LUKE All right, come on! And the red one, come on. Well, come"
"on, Red, let’s go."
As the Jawas start to lead the three remaining robots back into the
"Sandcrawler, Artoo lets out a pathetic little beep and starts after his"
"old friend Threepio. He is restrained by a slimy Jawa, who zaps him"
with a control box.
Owen is negotiating with the head Jawa. Luke and the two robots
"start for the garage when a plate pops off the head of the red astrodroid,"
throwing parts all over the ground. He adjusts the astro-droid’s
head plate and it sparks wildly.
LUKE Uncle Owen…
OWEN Yeah?
LUKE This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look!
"OWEN (to the head Jawa) Hey, what’re you trying to push on us?"
"The Jawa goes into a loud spiel. Meanwhile, Artoo has sneaked out"
of line and is moving up and down trying to attract attention. He lets
out with a low whistle. Threepio taps Luke on the shoulder.
"THREEPIO (pointing to Artoo) Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in"
prime condition. A real bargain.
LUKE Uncle Owen…
OWEN Yeah?
LUKE What about that one?
OWEN (to Jawa) What about that blue one? We’ll take that one.
With a little reluctance the scruffy dwarf trades the damaged astrodroid
for Artoo.
"LUKE Yeah, take it away."
"THREEPIO Uh, I’m quite sure you’ll be very pleased with that one,"
sir. He really is in first-class condition. I’ve worked with him before.
Here he comes.
Owen pays off the whining Jawa and the two robots trudge off toward
a grimy homestead entry.
"LUKE Okay, let’s go."
"THREEPIO (to Artoo) Now, don’t forget this! Why I should stick my"
neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity! INT. LARS
HOMESTEAD – GARAGE AREA – LATE AFTERNOON
"The garage is cluttered and worn, but a friendly peaceful atmosphere"
permeates the low gray chamber. Threepio lowers himself into a
large tub filled with warm oil. Near the battered Landspeeder little
Artoo rests on a large battery with a cord to his face.
THREEPIO Thank the maker! This oil bath is going to feel so good.
"I’ve got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move!"
Artoo beeps a muffled reply. Luke seems to be lost in thought as he
runs his hand over the damaged fin of a small two-man skyhopper
spaceship resting in a low hangar off the garage. Finally Luke’s
frustrations get the better of him and he slams a wrench across the
workbench.
"LUKE It just isn’t fair. Oh, Biggs is right. I’m never gonna get out of"
here!
THREEPIO Is there anything I might do to help?
Luke glances at the battered robot. A bit of his anger drains and a tiny
smile creeps across his face.
"LUKE Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest,"
or teleport me off this rock!
"THREEPIO I don’t think so, sir. I’m only a droid and not very"
"knowledgeable about such things. Not on this planet, anyways. As a"
"matter of fact, I’m not even sure which planet I’m on."
"LUKE Well, if there’s a bright center to the universe, you’re on"
the planet that it’s farthest from.
"THREEPIO I see, sir."
"LUKE Uh, you can call me Luke."
"THREEPIO I see, sir Luke."
LUKE (laughing) Just Luke.
"THREEPIO And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this"
"is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo."
LUKE Hello.
Artoo beeps in response. Luke unplugs Artoo and begins to scrape
several connectors on the robot’s head with a chrome pick. Threepio
climbs out of the oil tub and begins wiping oil from his bronze body.
LUKE You got a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys
have seen a lot of action.
"THREEPIO With all we’ve been through, sometimes I’m amazed"
"we’re in as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all."
LUKE You know of the Rebellion against the Empire?
"THREEPIO That’s how we came to be in your service, if you take my"
"meaning, sir."
LUKE Have you been in many battles?
"THREEPIO Several, I think. Actually, there’s not much to tell. I’m not"
"much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling"
"stories. Well, not at making them interesting, anyways."
Luke struggles to remove a small metal fragment from Artoo’s neck
joint. He uses a larger pick.
"LUKE Well, my little friend, you’ve got something jammed in here"
real good. Were you on a starcruiser or…
"The fragment breaks loose with a snap, sending Luke tumbling head"
over heels. He sits up and sees a twelve-inch three-dimensional
"hologram of Leia Organa, the Rebel senator, being projected from the"
face of little Artoo. The image is a rainbow of colors as it flickers and
jiggles in the dimly lit garage. Luke’s mouth hangs open in awe.
"LEIA Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You’re my only hope."
LUKE What’s this?
Artoo looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for Threepio to
translate.
Leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment over and over.
THREEPIO What is what?!? He asked you a question… (pointing to
Leia) What is that?
Artoo whistles his surprise as he pretends to just notice the hologram.
He looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for Threepio to
translate. Leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment over and
over.
"LEIA Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You’re my only hope. Help me, Obi-"
Wan Kenobi. You’re my only hope.
"THREEPIO Oh, he says it’s nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction. Old"
data. Pay it no mind.
Luke becomes intrigued by the beautiful girl.
LUKE Who is she? She’s beautiful.
"THREEPIO I’m afraid I’m not quite sure, sir."
"LEIA Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi…"
THREEPIO I think she was a passenger on our last voyage. A person
"of some importance, sir – I believe. Our captain was attached to…"
LUKE Is there more to this recording?
Luke reaches out for Artoo but he lets out several frantic squeaks and
a whistle.
"THREEPIO Behave yourself, Artoo. You’re going to get us in"
"trouble. It’s all right, you can trust him. He’s our new master."
Artoo whistles and beeps a long message to Threepio.
"THREEPIO He says he’s the property of Obi- Wan Kenobi, a resident"
"of these parts. And it’s a private message for him. Quite frankly, sir,"
I don’t know what he’s talking about. Our last master was
"Captain Antilles, but with what we’ve been through, this little R2 unit"
has become a bit eccentric.
LUKE Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi?
"THREEPIO I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he’s talking"
about?
"LUKE Well, I don’t know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives"
out beyond the dune sea. He’s kind of a strange old hermit.
Luke’s gazes at the beautiful young princess for a few moments.
LUKE I wonder who she is. It sounds like she’s in trouble. I’d
better play back the whole thing.
Artoo beeps something to Threepio.
THREEPIO He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his
"recording system. He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might"
be able to play back the entire recording.
"Luke looks longingly at the lovely, little princess and hasn’t really"
heard what Threepio has been saying.
"LUKE H’m? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you’re too small to run away on"
me if I take this off! Okay.
Luke takes a wedged bar and pops the restraining bolt off Artoo’s
side.
LUKE There you go.
The princess immediately disappears.
"LUKE Well, wait a minute. Where’d she go? Bring her back! Play"
back the entire message.
Artoo beeps an innocent reply as Threepio sits up in embarrassment.
THREEPIO What message? The one you’ve just been playing. The
one you’re carrying inside your rusty innards!
A women’s voice calls out from another room.
AUNT BERU Luke? Luke! Come to dinner!
Luke stands up and shakes his head at the malfunctioning robot.
"LUKE All right, I’ll be right there, Aunt Beru."
"THREEPIO I’m sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight"
flutter.
Luke tosses Artoo’s restraining bolt on the workbench and hurries out
of the room.
"LUKE Well, see what you can do with him. I’ll be right back."
THREEPIO (to Artoo) Just you reconsider playing that message for
him.
Artoo beeps in response.
"THREEPIO No, I don’t think he likes you at all."
Artoo beeps.
"THREEPIO No, I don’t like you either. INT. LARS HOMESTEAD –"
DINING AREA
"Luke’s Aunt Beru, a warm, motherly woman, fills a pitcher with blue"
fluid from a refrigerated container in the well-used kitchen. She puts
the pitcher on a tray with some bowls of food and starts for the dining
area.
Luke sits with his Uncle Owen before a table covered with steaming
bowls of food as Aunt Beru carries in a bowl of red grain.
"LUKE You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been"
stolen.
OWEN What makes you think that?
"LUKE Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him."
He says he belongs to someone called Obi- Wan Kenobi.
"Owen is greatly alarmed at the mention of his name, but manages to"
control himself.
LUKE I thought he might have meant Ben. Do you know what he’s
"talking about? Well, I wonder if he’s related to Ben."
Owen breaks loose with a fit of uncontrolled anger.
OWEN That old man’s just a crazy wizard. Tomorrow I want you
to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory
flushed. That’ll be the end of it. It belongs to us now.
LUKE But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?
"OWEN He won’t, I don’t think he exists any more. He died about the"
same time as your father.
LUKE He knew my father?
OWEN I told you to forget it. Your only concern is to prepare the
new droids for tomorrow. In the morning I want them on the south
ridge working out those condensers.
"LUKE Yes, sir. I think those new droids are going to work out fine. In"
"fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying"
"on another season. And if these new droids do work out, I want to"
transmit my application to the Academy this year.
"Owen’s face becomes a scowl, although he tries to suppress it."
OWEN You mean the next semester before harvest?
"LUKE Sure, there’re more than enough droids."
OWEN Harvest is when I need you the most. Only one more
season. This year we’ll make enough on the harvest so I’ll be able
to hire some more hands. And then you can go to the Academy
next year.
"Luke continues to toy with his food, not looking at his uncle."
"OWEN You must understand I need you here, Luke."
LUKE But it’s a whole ‘nother year.
"OWEN Look, it’s only one more season."
Luke pushes his half-eaten plate of food aside and stands.
"LUKE Yeah, that’s what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left."
AUNT BERU Where are you going?
LUKE It looks like I’m going nowhere. I have to finish cleaning
those droids.
"Resigned to his fate, Luke paddles out of the room. Owen"
mechanically finishes his dinner.
"AUNT BERU Owen, he can’t stay here forever. Most of his friends"
have gone. It means so much to him.
OWEN I’ll make it up to him next year. I promise.
"AUNT BERU Luke’s just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his"
father in him.
OWEN That’s what I’m afraid of. EXT. TATOOINE – LARS
HOMESTEAD
The giant twin suns of Tatooine slowly disappear behind a distant
"dune range. Luke stands watching them for a few moments, then"
reluctantly enters the doomed entrance to the homestead. INT. LARS
HOMESTEAD – GARAGE
Luke enters the garage to discover the robots nowhere in sight. He
takes a small control box from his utility belt similar to the one the
"Jawas were carrying. He activates the box, which creates a low hum,"
"and Threepio, letting out a short yell, pops up from behind the"
Skyhopper spaceship.
LUKE What are you doing hiding there?
"Threepio stumbles forward, but Artoo is still nowhere in sight."
"THREEPIO It wasn’t my fault, sir. Please don’t deactivate me. I told"
"him not to go, but he’s faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about"
his mission.
"LUKE Oh, no!"
Luke races out of the garage followed by Threepio. EXT. TATOOINE
– LARS HOMESTEAD
Luke rushes out of the small doomed entry to the homestead and
searches the darkening horizon for the small triped astro-robot.
Threepio struggles out of the homestead and on the salt flat as Luke
scans the landscape with his electrobinoculars.
THREEPIO That R2 unit has always been a problem. These astrodroids
are getting quite out of hand. Even I can’t understand their
logic at times.
LUKE How could I be so stupid? He’s nowhere in sight. Blast it!
"THREEPIO Pardon me, sir, but couldn’t we go after him?"
LUKE It’s too dangerous with all the Sand People around. We’ll
have to wait until morning.
Owen yells up from the homestead plaza.
"OWEN Luke, I’m shutting the power down for the night."
"LUKE All right, I’ll be there in a few minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it."
He takes one final look across the dim horizon.
LUKE You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble.
"THREEPIO Oh, he excels at that, sir. INT. LARS HOMESTEAD –"
PLAZA
Morning slowly creeps into the sparse but sparkling oasis of the open
"courtyard. The idyll is broken be the yelling of Uncle Owen, his voice"
echoing throughout the homestead.
OWEN Luke? Luke? Luke? Where could he be loafing now! INT.
LARS HOMESTEAD – KITCHEN
The interior of the kitchen is a worm glow as Aunt Beru prepares the
morning breakfast. Owen enters in a huff.
OWEN Have you seen Luke this morning?
AUNT BERU He said he had some things to do before he started
"today, so he left early."
OWEN Uh? Did he take those two new droids with him?
AUNT BERU I think so.
"OWEN Well, he’d better have those units in the south range repaired"
be midday or there’ll be hell to pay! EXT. TATOOINE – DESERT

The rock and sand of the desert floor are a blur as Threepio pilots the
sleek Landspeeder gracefully across the vast wasteland. INT./EXT.
LUKE’S SPEEDER – DESERT WASTELAND – TRAVELING – DAY
Luke leans over the back of the speeder and adjusts something in the
motor compartment.
LUKE (yelling) How’s that.
Threepio signals that is fine and Luke turns back into the windwhipped
cockpit and pops the canopy shut.
"LUKE Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere, but I"
don’t see how that R2 unit could have come this far. We must
have missed him. Uncle Owen isn’t going to take this very well.
"THREEPIO Sir, would it help if you told him it was my fault."
LUKE (brightening) Sure. He needs you. He’d probably only
deactivate you for a day or so…
"THREEPIO Deactivate! Well, on the other hand if you hadn’t removed"
his restraining bolt…
"LUKE Wait, there’s something dead ahead on the scanner. It looks"
like our droid… hit the accelerator. EXT. TATOOINE – ROCK MESA
– DUNE SEA – COASTLINE – DAY
"From high on a rock mesa, the tiny Landspeeder can be seen gliding"
across the desert floor. Suddenly in the foreground two weatherbeaten
Sand People shrouded in their grimy desert cloaks peer over
the edge of the rock mesa. One of the marginally human creatures
raises a long ominous laser rifle and points it at the speeder but the
second creature grabs the gun before it can be fired.
"The Sand People, or Tusken Raiders as they’re sometimes called,"
speak in a coarse barbaric language as they get into an animated
argument. The second Tusken Raider seems to get in the final word
and the nomads scurry over the rocky terrain. EXT. TATOOINE –
ROCK MESA – CANYON
The Tusken Raiders approaches two large Banthas standing tied to a
"rock. The monstrous, bear-like creatures are as large as elephants,"
"with huge red eyes, tremendous looped horns, and long, furry,"
dinosaur-like tails. The Tusken Raiders mount saddles strapped to
the huge creatures’ shaggy backs and ride off down the rugged
bluff. EXT. TATOOINE – ROCK CANYON – FLOOR
"The speeder is parked on the floor of a massive canyon. Luke, with"
"his long laser rifle slung over his shoulder, stands before little Artoo."
"LUKE Hey, whoa, just where do you think you’re going?"
"The little droid whistles a feeble reply, as Threepio poses menacingly"
behind the little runaway.
THREEPIO Master Luke here is your rightful owner. We’ll have no
more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish… and don’t talk to me of your
"mission, either. You’re fortunate he doesn’t blast you into a million"
pieces right here.
"LUKE Well, come on. It’s getting late. I only hope we can get back"
before Uncle Owen really blows up.
"THREEPIO If you don’t mind my saying so, sir, I think you should"
deactivate the little fugitive until you’ve gotten him back to your
workshop.
"LUKE No, he’s not going to try anything."
Suddenly the little robot jumps to life with a mass of frantic whistles
and screams.
LUKE What’s wrong with him now?
"THREEPIO Oh my… sir, he says there are several creatures"
approaching from the southeast.
Luke swings his rifle into position and looks to the south.
"LUKE Sand People! Or worse! Come on, let’s have a look. Come"
on. EXT. TATOOINE – ROCK CANYON – RIDGE – DAY
Luke carefully makes his way to the top of a rock ridge and scans the
canyon with his electrobinoculars.
He spots the two riderless Banthas. Threepio struggles up behind the
young adventurer.
LUKE There are two Banthas down there but I don’t see any… wait
"a second, they’re Sand People all right. I can see one of them now."
Luke watches the distant Tusken Raider through his
electrobinoculars. Suddenly something huge moves in front of his
"field of view. Before Luke or Threepio can react, a large, gruesome"
Tusken Raider looms over them. Threepio is startled and backs
"away, right off the side if the cliff. He can be heard for several"
"moments as he clangs, bangs and rattles down the side of the"
mountain.
"The towering creature brings down his curved, double-pointed"
gaderffii – the dreaded axe blade that has struck terror in the heart of
the local settlers. But Luke manages to block the blow with his laser
"rifle, which is smashed to pieces. The terrified farm boy scrambles"
backward until he is forced to the edge of a deep crevice. The sinister
Raider stands over him with his weapon raised and lets out a horrible
shrieking laugh. EXT. TATOOINE – ROCK CANYON – FLOOR –
DAY
Artoo forces himself into the shadows of a small alcove in the rocks
as the vicious Sand People walk past carrying the inert Luke
"Skywalker, who is dropped in a heap before the speeder. The Sand"
"People ransack the speeder, throwing parts and supplies in all"
directions. Suddenly they stop. Then everything is quiet for a few
moments. A great howling moan is heard echoing throughout the
canyon which sends the Sand People fleeing in terror.
Artoo moves even tighter into the shadows as the slight swishing
"sound that frightened off the Sand People grows even closer, until a"
shabby old desert-rat-of-a-man appears and leans over Luke. His
"ancient leathery face, cracked and weathered by exotic climates is"
"set off by dark, penetrating eyes and a scraggly white beard. Ben"
Kenobi squints his eyes as he scrutinizes the unconscious farm boy.
Artoo makes a slight sound and Ben turns and looks right at him.
BEN Hello there! Come here my little friend. Don’t be afraid.
Artoo waddles over to where Luke lies crumpled in a heap and begins
to whistle and beep his concern. Ben puts his hand on Luke’s
forehead and he begins to come around.
"BEN Don’t worry, he’ll be all right."
LUKE What happened?
"BEN Rest easy, son, you’ve had a busy day. You’re fortunate"
you’re still in one piece.
"LUKE Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to see you!"
"BEN The Jundland Wastes are not to be traveled lightly. Tell me,"
"young Luke, what brings you out this far?"
"LUKE Oh, this little droid! I think he’s searching for his former"
master … I’ve never seen such devotion in a droid before… there
seems to be no stopping him. He claims to be the property of an Obi-
Wan Kenobi. Is he a relative of yours? Do you know who he’s talking
about?
"Ben ponders this for a moment, scratching his scruffy beard."
BEN Obi-Wan Kenobi… Obi-Wan? Now thats a name I haven’t heard
in a long time… a long time.
LUKE I think my uncle knew him. He said he was dead.
"BEN Oh, he’s not dead, no… not yet."
LUKE You know him!
"BEN Well of course, of course I know him. He’s me! I haven’t gone by"
"the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born."
LUKE Then the droid does belong to you.
BEN Don’t seem to remember ever owning a droid. Very interesting…
He suddenly looks up at the overhanging cliffs.
BEN I think we better get indoors. The Sand People are easily
startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers.
Luke sits up and rubs his head. Artoo lets out a pathetic beep causing
Luke to remember something. He looks around.
LUKE … Threepio! EXT. TATOOINE – SAND PIT – ROCK MESA –
DAY
Little Artoo stands at the edge of a large sand pit and begins to
chatter away in electronic whistles and beeps. Luke and Ben stand
over a very dented and tangled Threepio lying half buried in the sand.
One of his arms has broken off.
Luke tries to revive the inert robot by shaking him and then flips a
hidden switch on his back several times until finally the mechanical
man’s systems turn on.
THREEPIO Where am I? I must have taken a bad step…
LUKE Can you stand? We’ve got to get out of here before the Sand
People return.
"THREEPIO I don’t think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke."
There’s no sense in you risking yourself on my account. I’m done for.
Artoo makes a beeping sound.
"LUKE No, you’re not. What kind of talk is that?"
Luke and Ben help the battered robot to his feet. Little Artoo watches
from the top of the pit. Ben glances around suspiciously. Sensing
"something, he stands up and sniffs the air."
"BEN Quickly, son… they’re on the move. INT. KENOBI’S DWELLING"
"The small, spartan hovel is cluttered with desert junk but still"
manages to radiate an air of time-worn comfort and security. Luke is
"in one corner repairing Threepio’s arm, as old Ben sits thinking."
"LUKE No, my father didn’t fight in the wars. He was a navigator on"
a spice freighter.
BEN That’s what your uncle told you. He didn’t hold with your
father’s ideals. Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten
involved.
LUKE You fought in the Clone Wars?
"BEN Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father."
LUKE I wish I’d known him.
"BEN He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I"
understand you’ve become quite a good pilot yourself. And he was a
good friend. Which reminds me…
Ben gets up and goes to a chest where he rummages around. As
Luke finishes repairing Threepio and starts to fit the restraining bolt
"back on, Threepio looks at him nervously. Luke thinks about the bolt"
for a moment then puts it on the table. Ben shuffles up and presents
Luke with a short handle with several electronic gadgets attached to
it.
BEN I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to
"have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn’t allow"
it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damnedfool
idealistic crusade like your father did.
"THREEPIO Sir, if you’ll not be needing me, I’ll close down for awhile."
"LUKE Sure, go ahead."
Ben hands Luke the saber.
LUKE What is it?
BEN Your fathers lightsaber. This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not
as clumsy or as random as a blaster.
Luke pushes a button on the handle. A long beam shoots out about
four feet and flickers there. The light plays across the ceiling.
BEN An elegant weapon for a more civilized time. For over
a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace
"and justice in the Old Republic. Before the dark times, before the"
Empire.
Luke hasn’t really been listening.
LUKE How did my father die?
"BEN A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until"
"he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the"
Jedi Knights. He betrayed and murdered your father. Now the Jedi
are all but extinct. Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.
LUKE The Force?
"BEN Well, the Force is what gives the Jedi his power. It’s an"
energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and
penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together.
Artoo makes beeping sounds.
"BEN Now, let’s see if we can’t figure out what you are, my little friend."
And where you come from.
LUKE I saw part of the message he was…
Luke is cut short as the recorded image of the beautiful young Rebel
princess is projected from Artoo’s face.
BEN I seem to have found it.
Luke stops his work as the lovely girl’s image flickers before his eyes.
"LEIA General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the"
Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against
the Empire. I regret that I am unable to present my father’s request
"to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I’m"
afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed
information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory
systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You
must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is our
"most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you’re my only"
hope.
There is a little static and the transmission is cut short. Old Ben leans
back and scratches his head. He silently puffs on a tarnished chrome
water pipe. Luke has stars in his eyes.
BEN You must learn the ways of the Force if you’re to come with
me to Alderaan.
LUKE (laughing) Alderaan? I’m not going to Alderaan. I’ve got to go
"home. It’s late, I’m in for it as it is."
"BEN I need your help, Luke. I’m getting too old for this sort of"
thing. She needs your help.
LUKE I can’t get involved! I’ve got work to do! It’s not that I like the
Empire. I hate it! But there’s nothing I can do about it right now. It’s
such a long way from here.
BEN That’s your uncle talking.
"LUKE (sighing) Oh, God, my uncle. How am I ever going to explain"
this?
"BEN Learn about the Force, Luke."
"LUKE Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get"
a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you’re going.
"BEN You must do what you feel is right, of course. EXT. SPACE"
An Imperial Star Destroyer heads toward the evil planet-like battle
station: the Death Star! INT. DEATH STAR – CONFERENCE ROOM
Eight Imperial senators and generals sit around a black conference
table. Imperial stormtroopers stand guard around the room.
"Commander Tagge, a young, slimy-looking general, is speaking."
TAGGE Until this battle station is fully operational we are
vulnerable. The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. They’re more
dangerous than you realize.
The bitter Admiral Motti twists nervously in his chair.
"MOTTI Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander; not to this"
battle station!
TAGGE The Rebellion will continue to gain support in the
Imperial Senate as long as….
Suddenly all heads turn as Commander Tagge’s speech is cut short
"and the Grand Moff Tarkin, governor of the Imperial outland regions,"
"enters. He is followed by his powerful ally, The Sith Lord, Darth"
"Vader. All of the generals stand and bow before the thin, evil-looking"
governor as he takes his place at the head of the table. The Dark
Lord stands behind him.
TARKIN The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us.
I’ve just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council
permanently. The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept
away.
TAGGE That’s impossible! How will the Emperor maintain control
without the bureaucracy?
TARKIN The regional governors now have direct control over
territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line. Fear of this battle
station.
TAGGE And what of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a
"complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however"
"unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it."
VADER The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.
MOTTI Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be
"a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they’ve"
obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe. I
suggest we use it!
VADER Don’t be too proud of this technological terror
you’ve constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next
to the power of the Force.
"MOTTI Don’t try to frighten us with your sorcerer’s ways, Lord Vader."
Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you
"conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to"
find the Rebel’s hidden fort…
Suddenly Motti chokes and starts to turn blue under Vader’s spell.
VADER I find your lack of faith disturbing.
"TARKIN Enough of this! Vader, release him!"
VADER As you wish.
TARKIN This bickering is pointless. Lord Vader will provide us
with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station
is operational. We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift
stroke. EXT. TATOOINE – WASTELAND
The speeder stops before what remains of the huge Jawas
Sandcrawler. Luke and Ben walk among the smoldering rubble and
scattered bodies.
"LUKE It looks like Sand People did this, all right. Look, here are"
"gaffi sticks, bantha tracks. It’s just… I never heard of them hitting"
anything this big before.
Ben is crouching in the sand studying the tracks.
BEN They didn’t. But we are meant to think they did. These tracks
are side by side. Sand People always ride single file to hide
there numbers.
LUKE These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio.
"BEN And these blast points, too accurate for Sand People."
Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise.
LUKE Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas?
Luke looks back at the speeder where Artoo and Threepio are
"inspecting the dead Jawas, and put two and two together."
"LUKE If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who"
they sold them to. And that would lead them back home!
"Luke reaches a sudden horrible realization, then races for the"
speeder and jumps in.
"BEN Wait, Luke! It’s too dangerous."
Luke races off leaving Ben and the two robots alone with the burning
Sandcrawler. EXT. TATOOINE – WASTELAND
Luke races across the wasteland in his battered Landspeeder. EXT.
TATOOINE – LARS HOMESTEAD
The speeder roars up to the homestead. Luke jumps out and runs to
the smoking holes that were once his home. Debris is scattered
everywhere and it looks as if a great battle has taken place.
LUKE Uncle Owen! Aunt Beru! Uncle Owen!
Luke stumbles around in a daze looking for his aunt and uncle.
"Suddenly he comes upon their smoldering remains. He is stunned,"
and cannot speak. Hate replaces fear and a new resolve comes over
him. EXT. SPACE
Imperial TIE fighter races toward the Death Star. INT. DEATH STAR
– DETENTION CORRIDOR
Two stormtroopers open an electronic cell door and allow several
"Imperial guards to enter. Princess Leia’s face is filled with defiance,"
"which slowly gives way to fear as a giant black torture robot enters,"
followed by Darth Vader.
"VADER And, now Your Highness, we will discuss the location of"
your hidden Rebel base.
The torture robot gives off a steady beeping sound as it approaches
Princess Leia and extends one of its mechanical arms bearing a large
hypodermic needle. The door slides shut and the long cell block
hallway appears peaceful. The muffled screams of the Rebel princess
are barely heard. EXT. TATOOINE – WASTELAND
There is a large bonfire of Jawa bodies blazing in front of the
sandcrawler as Ben and the robots finish burning the dead. Luke
drives up in the speeder and Ben walks over to him.
"BEN There’s nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been"
"there. You’d have been killed, too, and the droids would now be in"
the hands of the Empire.
LUKE I want to come with you to Alderaan. There’s nothing here for
me now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like
my father. EXT. TATOOINE – WASTELAND
"The Landspeeder with Luke, Artoo, Threepio, and Ben in it zooms"
across the desert. The speeder stops on a bluff overlooking the
"spaceport at Mos Eisley. It is a haphazard array of low, gray,"
concrete structures and semi-domes. A harsh gale blows across the
stark canyon floor. Luke adjusts his goggles and walks to the edge of
the craggy bluff where Ben is standing.
BEN Mos Eisley Spaceport. You will never find a more wretched
hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious.
"Ben looks over at Luke, who gives the old Jedi a determined"
smile. EXT. TATOOINE – MOS EISLEY – STREET
The speeder is stopped on a crowded street by several combathardened
stormtroopers who look over the two robots. A Trooper
questions Luke.
TROOPER How long have you had these droids?
LUKE About three or four seasons.
BEN They’re for sale if you want them.
TROOPER Let me see your identification.
Luke becomes very nervous as he fumbles to find his ID while Ben
speaks to the Trooper in a very controlled voice.
BEN You don’t need to see his identification.
TROOPER We don’t need to see his identification.
BEN These are not the droids you’re looking for.
TROOPER These are not the droids we’re looking for.
BEN He can go about his business.
TROOPER You can go about your business.

TROOPER Move along. Move along. EXT. TATOOINE – MOS
EISLEY – STREET
The speeder pulls up in front of a rundown blockhouse cantina on the
"outskirts of the spaceport. Various strange forms of transport,"
"including several unusual beasts of burden, are parked outside the"
bar. A Jawa runs up and begins to fondle the speeder.
THREEPIO I can’t abide these Jawas. Disgusting creatures.
As Luke gets out of the speeder he tries to shoo the Jawa away.
"LUKE Go on, go on. I can’t understand how we got by those troopers."
I thought we were dead.
BEN The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded.
You will find it a powerful ally.
LUKE Do you really think we’re going to find a pilot here that’ll take us
to Alderaan?
"BEN Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here."
Only watch your step. This place can be a little rough.
LUKE I’m ready for anything.
"THREEPIO Come along, Artoo. INT. TATOOINE – MOS EISLEY –"
CANTINA
The young adventurer and his two mechanical servants follow Ben
"Kenobi into the smoke-filled cantina. The murky, moldy den is filled"
with a startling array of weird and exotic alien creatures and monsters
"at the long metallic bar. At first the sight is horrifying. One-eyed,"
"thousand-eyed, slimy, furry, scaly, tentacled, and clawed creatures"
huddle over drinks. Ben moves to an empty spot at the bar near a
"group of repulsive but human scum. A huge, rough-looking Bartender"
stops Luke and the robots.
BARTENDER We don’t serve their kind here!
Luke still recovering from the shock of seeing so many outlandish
"creatures, doesn’t quite catch the bartender’s drift."
LUKE What?
BARTENDER Your droids. They’ll have to wait outside. We don’t
want them here.
"Luke looks at old Ben, who is busy talking to one of the Galactic"
pirates. He notices several of the gruesome creatures along the bar
are giving him a very unfriendly glare.
Luke pats Threepio on the shoulder.
"LUKE Listen, why don’t you wait out by the speeder. We don’t want"
any trouble.
THREEPIO I heartily agree with you sir.
Threepio and his stubby partner go outside and most of the creatures
at the bar go back to their drinks.
"Ben is standing next to Chewbacca, an eight-foot-tall-savage-looking"
creature resembling a huge gray bushbaby monkey with fierce
baboon-like fangs. His large blue eyes dominate a fur-covered face
"and soften his otherwise awesome appearance. Over his matted,"
"furry body he wears two chrome bandoliers, and little else. He is a"
two-hundred-year-old Wookiee and a sight to behold.
"Ben speaks to the Wookiee, pointing to Luke several times during his"
conversation and the huge creature suddenly lets out a horrifying
laugh. Luke is more than a little bit disconcerted and pretends not to
hear the conversation between Ben and the giant Wookiee.
"Luke is terrified but tries not to show it. He quietly sips his drink,"
looking over the crowd for a more sympathetic ear or whatever.
"A large, multiple-eyed Creature gives Luke a rough shove."
CREATURE Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!?
The hideous freak is obviously drunk. Luke tries to ignore the
"creature and turns back on his drink. A short, grubby Human and an"
even smaller rodent-like beast join the belligerent monstrosity.
HUMAN He doesn’t like you.
LUKE I’m sorry.
HUMAN I don’t like you either
The big creature is getting agitated and yells out some unintelligible
"gibberish at the now rather nervous, young adventurer."
HUMAN (continuing) Don’t insult us. You just watch yourself. We’re
wanted men. I have the death sentence on twelve systems.
LUKE I’ll be careful than.
HUMAN You’ll be dead.
The rodent lets out a loud grunt and everything at the bar moves
away. Luke tries to remain cool but it isn’t easy. His three adversaries
ready their weapons. Old Ben moves in behind Luke.
BEN This little one isn’t worth the effort. Come let me buy
you something…
A powerful blow from the unpleasant creature sends the young
"would-be Jedi sailing across the room, crashing through tables and"
breaking a large jug filled with a foul-looking liquid. With a bloodcurdling
"shriek, the monster draws a wicked chrome laser pistol from"
his belt and levels it at old Ben. The bartender panics.
BARTENDER No blasters! No blaster!
With astounding agility old Ben’s laser sword sparks to life and in a
flash an arm lies on the floor. The rodent is cut in two and the giant
"multiple-eyed creature lies doubled, cut from chin to groin. Ben"
carefully and precisely turns off his laser sword and replaces it on his
"utility belt. Luke, shaking and totally amazed at the old man’s abilities,"
attempts to stand. The entire fight has lasted only a matter of
"seconds. The cantina goes back to normal, although Ben is given a"
"respectable amount of room at the bar. Luke, rubbing his bruised"
"head, approaches the old man with new awe. Ben points the the"
Wookiee.
BEN This is Chewbacca. He’s first- mate on a ship that might suit our
needs. EXT. TATOOINE – MOS EISLEY – STREET
Threepio paces in front of the cantina as Artoo carries on an

Strange creatures play exotic big band music on odd-looking
"instruments as Luke, still giddy, downs a fresh drink and follows Ben"
"and Chewbacca to a booth where Han Solo is sitting. Han is a tough,"
"roguish starpilot about thirty years old. A mercenary on a starship, he"
"is simple, sentimental, and cocksure."
HAN Han Solo. I’m captain of the Millennium Falcon. Chewie
here tells me you’re looking for passage to the Alderaan system.
"BEN Yes, indeed. If it’s a fast ship."
HAN Fast ship? You’ve never heard of the Millennium Falcon?
BEN Should I have?
HAN It’s the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve
parsecs!
Ben reacts to Solo’s stupid attempt to impress them with obvious
misinformation.
"HAN (continuing) I’ve outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulkcruisers,"
mind you. I’m talking about the big Corellian ships now.
"She’s fast enough for you, old man. What’s the cargo?"
"BEN Only passengers. Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions"
asked.
HAN What is it? Some kind of local trouble?
BEN Let’s just say we’d like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.
"HAN Well, that’s the real trick, isn’t it? And it’s going to cost you"
something extra. Ten thousand in advance.
LUKE Ten thousand? We could almost buy our own ship for that!
"HAN But who’s going to fly it, kid! You?"
LUKE You bet I could. I’m not such a bad pilot myself! We don’t
have to sit here and listen…
BEN We haven’t that much with us. But we could pay you two
"thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan."
"HAN Seventeen, huh!"
Han ponders this for a few moments.
HAN Okay. You guys got yourself a ship. We’ll leave as soon as
you’re ready. Docking bay Ninety-four.
BEN Ninety-four.
HAN Looks like somebody’s beginning to take an interest in your
handiwork.
Ben and Luke turn around to see four Imperial stormtroopers looking
at the dead bodies and asking the bartenders some questions. The
bartender points to the booth.
"TROOPER All right, we’ll check it out."
The stormtroopers look over at the booth but Luke and Ben are gone.
The bartender shrugs his shoulders in puzzlement.
HAN Seventeen thousand! Those guys must really be desperate.
This could really save my neck. Get back to the ship and get her
ready. EXT. TATOOINE – MOS EISLEY – STREET

foreign tongue translated into English subtitles.
"GREEDO Going somewhere, Solo?"
"HAN Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your"
boss. Tell Jabba that I’ve got his money.
Han sits down and the alien sits across from him holding the gun on
him.
GREEDO It’s too late. You should have paid him when you had the
"chance. Jabba’s put a price on your head, so large that every bounty"
hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you. I’m lucky I found you first.
"HAN Yeah, but this time I got the money."
"GREEDO If you give it to me, I might forget I found you."
HAN I don’t have it with me. Tell Jabba…
GREEDO Jabba’s through with you. He has no time for smugglers
who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.
HAN Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I had a choice?
Han Solo slowly reaches for his gun under the table.
GREEDO You can tell that to Jabba. He may only take your ship.
HAN Over my dead body.
GREEDO That’s the idea I’ve been looking forward to killing you for a
long time.
"HAN Yes, I’ll bet you have."
Suddenly the slimy alien disappears in a blinding flash of light. Han
pulls his smoking gun from beneath the table as the other patrons
look on in bemused amazement. Han gets up and starts out of the

A voice from directly behind the pirates startles them and they turn
"around to see Han Solo and the giant Wookiee, Chewbacca, standing"
behind them with no weapons in sight.
"HAN I’ve been waiting for you, Jabba."
JABBA I expected you would be.
HAN I’m not the type to run.
"JABBA (fatherly-smooth) Han, my boy, there are times when you"
disappoint me… why haven’t you paid me? And why did you have to
fry poor Greedo like that… after all we’ve been through together.
HAN You sent Greedo to blast me.
"JABBA (mock surprise) Han, why you’re the best smuggler in the"
business. You’re too valuable to fry. He was only relaying my concern
at your delays. He wasn’t going to blast you.
HAN I think he thought he was. Next time don’t send one of those
"twerps. If you’ve got something to say to me, come see me yourself."
"JABBA Han, Han! If only you hadn’t had to dump that shipment of"
spice… you understand I just can’t make an exception. Where would
I be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the
first sign of an Imperial starship? It’s not good business.
"HAN You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba. I had no"
"choice, but I’ve got a charter now and I can pay you back, plus a little"
extra. I just need some more time.
"JABBA (to his men) Put your blasters away. Han, my boy, I’m only"
"doing this because you’re the best and I need you. So, for an extra,"
say… twenty percent I’ll give you a little more time… but this is it. If

Han frantically types information into the ship’s computer. Little Artoo
"appears momentarily at the cockpit doorway, makes a few beeping"
"remarks, then scurries away."
HAN It looks like an Imperial cruiser. Our passengers must be hotter
than I thought. Try and hold them off. Angle the deflector shield

"Over the shoulders of Chewbacca and Han, we can see the galaxy"
spread before them. Luke and Ben make their way into the cramped

HAN Stay sharp! There are two more coming in; they’re going to
try to cut us off.
LUKE Why don’t you outrun them? I thought you said this thing
was fast.
"HAN Watch your mouth, kid, or you’re going to find yourself"
floating home. We’ll be safe enough once we make the jump to
"hyperspace. Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We’ll lose them! EXT."

The ship shudders as an explosion flashes outside the window.
HAN Here’s where the fun begins!
BEN How long before you can make the jump to light speed?
HAN It’ll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navicomputer.
The ship begins to rock violently as lasers hit it.
LUKE Are you kidding? At the rate they’re gaining…
"HAN Traveling through hyperspace isn’t like dusting crops, boy!"
Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or
"bounce too close to a supernova and that’d end your trip real quick,"
wouldn’t it?
The ship is now constantly battered with laserfire as a red warning
light begins to flash.
LUKE What’s that flashing?
"HAN We’re losing our deflector shield. Go strap yourself in, I’m going"
to make the jump to light speed.
"The galaxy brightens and they move faster, almost as if crashing a"
barrier. Stars become streaks as the pirateship makes the jump to

Admiral Motti enters the quiet control room and bows before
"Governor Tarkin, who stands before the huge wall screen displaying"
a small green planet.
MOTTI We’ve entered the Alderaan system.
Vader and two stormtroopers enter with Princess Leia. Her hands are
bound.
"LEIA Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you"
holding Vader’s leash. I recognized your foul stench when I was
brought on board.
TARKIN Charming to the last. You don’t know how hard I found it
signing the order to terminate your life!
LEIA I’m surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility
yourself!
"TARKIN Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be"
my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational.
No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.
"LEIA The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems"
will slip through your fingers.
"TARKIN Not after we demonstrate the power of this station. In a way,"
you have determined the choice of the planet that’ll be destroyed
first. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the
"Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station’s destructive"
power… on your home planet of Alderaan.
LEIA No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can’t
possibly…
TARKIN You would prefer another target? A military target? Then
name the system!
Tarkin waves menacingly toward Leia.
TARKIN I grow tired of asking this. So it’ll be the last time. Where
is the Rebel base?
Leia overhears an intercom voice announcing the approach to
Alderaan.
LEIA (softly) Dantooine.
Leia lowers her head.
LEIA They’re on Dantooine.
"TARKIN There. You see Lord Vader, she can be"
reasonable. (addressing Motti) Continue with the operation. You may
fire when ready.
LEIA What?
TARKIN You’re far too trusting. Dantooine is too remote to make an
effective demonstration. But don’t worry. We will deal with your
Rebel friends soon enough.
LEIA No! INT. DEATH STAR – BLAST CHAMBER
VADER Commence primary ignition.
A button is pressed which switches on a panel of lights. A hooded
Imperial soldier reaches overhead and pulls a lever. Another lever is
pulled. Vader reaches for still another lever and a bank of lights on a
panel and wall light up. A huge beam of light emanates from within a
cone-shaped area and converges into a single laser beam out toward
Alderaan. The small green planet of Alderaan is blown into space
dust. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON– CENTRAL HOLD AREA
Ben watches Luke practice the lightsaber with a small “seeker” robot.
"Ben suddenly turns away and sits down. He falters, seems almost"
faint.
LUKE Are you all right? What’s wrong?
BEN I felt a great disturbance in the Force… as if millions of voices
suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I
fear something terrible has happened.
Ben rubs his forehead. He seems to drift into a trance. Then he fixes
his gaze on Luke.
BEN You’d better get on with your exercises.
Han Solo enters the room.
"HAN Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I"
told you I’d outrun ‘em.
Luke is once again practicing with the lightsaber.
HAN Don’t everyone thank me at once.
Threepio watches Chewbacca and Artoo who are engrossed in a
game in which three-dimensional holographic figures move along a
chess-type board.
"HAN Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours."
Chewbacca and the two robots sit around the lighted table covered
with small holographic monsters. Each side of the table has a small
computer monitor embedded in it. Chewbacca seems very pleased
with himself as he rests his lanky fur-covered arms over his head.
"THREEPIO Now be careful, Artoo."
Artoo immediately reaches up and taps the computer with his stubby
"claw hand, causing one of the holographic creatures to walk to the"
new square. A sudden frown crosses Chewbacca’s face and he
begins yelling gibberish at the tiny robot. Threepio intercedes on
behalf of his small companion and begins to argue with the huge
Wookiee.
THREEPIO He made a fair move. Screaming about it won’t help you.
HAN (interrupting) Let him have it. It’s not wise to upset a Wookiee.
"THREEPIO But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid."
HAN That’s ’cause droids don’t pull people’s arms out of their
socket when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that.
"THREEPIO I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, Artoo. Let"
the Wookiee win.
Luke stands in the middle of the small hold area; he seems frozen in
place. A humming lightsaber is held high over his head. Ben watches
"him from the corner, studying his movements. Han watches with a bit"
of smugness.
"BEN Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him."
LUKE You mean it controls your actions?
BEN Partially. But it also obeys your commands.
"Suspended at eye level, about ten feet in front of Luke, a “seeker”, a"
"chrome baseball-like robot covered with antennae, hovers slowly in a"
wide arc. The ball floats to one side of the youth then to the other.
Suddenly it makes a lightning-swift lunge and stops within a few feet
of Luke’s face. Luke doesn’t move and the ball backs off. It slowly
"moves behind the boy, then makes another quick lunge, this time"
emitting a blood red laser beam as it attacks. It hits Luke in the leg
causing him to tumble over. Han lets loose with a burst of laughter.
HAN Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a
"good blaster at your side, kid."
"LUKE You don’t believe in the Force, do you?"
"HAN Kid, I’ve flown from one side of this galaxy to the other."
"I’ve seen a lot of strange stuff, but I’ve never seen anything to"
make me believe there’s one all-powerful force controlling
everything. There’s no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.
Ben smiles quietly
HAN It’s all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.
"BEN I suggest you try it again, Luke."
Ben places a large helmet on Luke’s head which covers his eyes.
"BEN This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct."
"LUKE (laughing) With the blast shield down, I can’t even see. How"
am I supposed to fight?
BEN Your eyes can deceive you. Don’t trust them.
Han skeptically shakes his head as Ben throws the seeker into the
"air. The ball shoots straight up in the air, then drops like a rock. Luke"
"swings the lightsaber around blindly missing the seeker, which fires"
off a laserbolt which hits Luke square on the seat of the pants. He lets
out a painful yell and attempts to hit the seeker.
BEN Stretch out with your feelings.
"Luke stands in one place, seemingly frozen. The seeker makes a"
"dive at Luke and, incredibly, he managed to deflect the bolt. The ball"
ceases fire and moves back to its original position.
"BEN You see, you can do it."
HAN I call it luck.
"BEN In my experience, there’s no such thing as luck."
"HAN Look, going good against remotes is one thing. Going good"
against the living? That’s something else.
Solo notices a small light flashing on the far side of the control panel.
HAN Looks like we’re coming up on Alderaan.
Han and Chewbacca head back to the cockpit.
"LUKE You know, I did feel something. I could almost see the remote."
BEN That’s good. You have taken your first step into a larger
world. INT. DEATH STAR – CONFERENCE ROOM
Imperial Officer Cass stands before Governor Tarkin and the evil
Dark Lord Darth Vader.
TARKIN Yes.
OFFICER CASS Our scout ships have reached Dantooine. They
"found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been"
deserted for some time. They are now conducting an extensive
search of the surrounding systems.
TARKIN She lied! She lied to us!
VADER I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion.
TARKIN Terminate her… immediately! EXT. HYPERSPACE
The pirateship is just coming out of hyperspace; a strange surreal
light show surrounds the ship. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON –
COCKPIT
"HAN Stand by, Chewie, here we go. Cut in the sublight engines."
Han pulls back on a control lever. Outside the cockpit window stars
"begin streaking past, seem to decrease in speed, then stop."
Suddenly the starship begins to shudder and violently shake about.
"Asteroids begin to race toward them, battering the sides of the ship."
"HAN What the…? Aw, we’ve come out of hyperspace into a meteor"
shower. Some kind of asteroid collision. It’s not on any of the charts.
The Wookiee flips off several controls and seems very cool in the
emergency. Luke makes his way into the bouncing cockpit.
LUKE What’s going on?
"HAN Our position is correct, except… no, Alderaan!"
LUKE What do you mean? Where is it?
"HAN Thats what I’m trying to tell you, kid. It ain’t there. It’s been"
totally blown away.
LUKE What? How?
Ben moves into the cockpit behind Luke as the ship begins to settle
down.
BEN Destroyed… by the Empire!
HAN The entire starfleet couldn’t destroy the whole planet. It’d take a
thousand ships with more fire power than I’ve…
A signal light starts flashing on the control panel and a muffled alarm
starts humming.
HAN There’s another ship coming in.
LUKE Maybe they know what happened.
BEN It’s an Imperial fighter.
Chewbacca barks his concern. A huge explosion bursts outside the
"cockpit window, shaking the ship violently. A tiny, finned Imperial TIE"
fighter races past the cockpit window.
LUKE It followed us!
BEN No. It’s a short range fighter.
HAN There aren’t any bases around here. Where did it come
from? EXT. SPACE
The fighter races past the Corellian pirateship. INT. MILLENNIUM
FALCON – COCKPIT
"LUKE It sure is leaving in a big hurry. If they identify us, we’re in"
big trouble.
HAN Not if I can help it. Chewie… jam it’s transmissions.
BEN It’d be as well to let it go. It’s too far out of range.
HAN Not for long… EXT. SPACE
The pirateship zooms over the camera and away into the vastness of
space after the Imperial TIE fighter. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON –

The tension mounts as the pirateship gains on the tiny fighter. In the
"distance, one of the stars becomes brighter until it is obvious that the"
TIE ship is heading for it. Ben stands behind Chewbacca.
BEN A fighter that size couldn’t get this deep into space on its own.
"LUKE Then he must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or"
something…
"HAN Well, he ain’t going to be around long enough to tell anyone"
about us. EXT. SPACE
The TIE fighter is losing ground to the larger pirateship as they race

The distant star can be distinguished as a small moon or planet.
LUKE Look at him. He’s heading for that small moon.
HAN I think I can get him before he gets there… he’s almost in range.
The small moon begins to take on the appearance of a monstrous
spherical battle station.
BEN That’s no moon! It’s a space station.
HAN It’s too big to be a space station.
LUKE I have a very bad feeling about this.
BEN Turn the ship around!
"HAN Yeah, I think your right. Full reverse! Chewie, lock in"
the auxiliary power.
The pirateship shudders and the TIE fighter accelerates away toward
the gargantuan battle station.
LUKE Why are we still moving towards it?
HAN We’re caught in a tractor beam! It’s pulling us in!
LUKE But there’s gotta be something you can do!
"HAN There’s nothin’ I can do about it, kid. I’m in full power. I’m"
going to have to shut down. But they’re not going to get me without a
fight!
Ben Kenobi puts a hand on his shoulder.
BEN You can’t win. But there are alternatives to fighting. INT.
MILLENNIUM FALCON – DEATH STAR
As the battered pirate starship is towed closer to the awesome metal

staggering. Running along the equator of the gigantic sphere is a
mile-high band of huge docking ports into which the helpless

"OFFICER No, sir. If there were any on board, they must also"
have jettisoned.
VADER Send a scanning crew on board. I want every part of this

A trooper runs through the hallway heading for the exit. In a few
moments all is quiet. The muffled sounds of a distant officer giving
orders finally fade. Two floor panels suddenly pop up revealing Han
Solo and Luke. Ben Kenobi sticks his head out of a third locker.
"LUKE Boy, it’s lucky you had these compartments."
HAN I use them for smuggling. I never thought I’d be smuggling
"myself in them. This is ridiculous. Even if I could take off, I’d never"
get past the tractor beam.
BEN Leave that to me!
HAN Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that!
BEN Who’s the more foolish… the fool or the fool who follows him?

"The crewmen carry a heavy box on board the ship, past the two"
stormtroopers guarding either side of the ramp.
"TROOPER The ship’s all yours. If the scanners pick up anything,"
"report it immediately. All right, let’s go."
The crewmen enter the pirateship and a loud crashing sound is
followed by a voice calling to the guard below.
"HAN’S VOICE Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this?"
The stormtroopers enter the ship and a quick round of gunfire is
heard. INT. DEATH STAR – FORWARD BAY – COMMAND OFFICE
"In a very small command office near the entrance to the pirateship, a"
Gantry Officer looks out his window and notices the guards are
missing. He speaks into the comlink.
GANTRY OFFICER TX-four-one-two. Why aren’t you at your post?
"TX-four-one-two, do you copy?"
A stormtrooper comes down the ramp of the pirateship and waves to
"the gantry officer, pointing to his ear, indicating his comlink is not"
working. The gantry officer shakes his head in disgust and heads for
"the door, giving his aide an annoyed look."
GANTRY OFFICER Take over. We’ve got a bad transmitter. I’ll see
what I can do.
"As the officer approaches the door, it slides open revealing the"
"towering Chewbacca. The gantry officer, in a momentary state of"
"shock, stumbles backward. With a bone-chilling howl, the giant"
Wookiee flattens the officer with one blow. The aide immediately
"reaches for his pistol, but is blasted by Han, dressed as an Imperial"
stormtrooper.
"Ben and the robots enter the room quickly followed by Luke, also"
dressed as a stormtrooper. Luke quickly removes his helmet.
"LUKE You know, between his howling and your blasting everything"
"in sight, it’s a wonder the whole station doesn’t know we’re here."
HAN Bring them on! I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking
around.
"THREEPIO We found the computer outlet, sir."
Ben feeds some information into the computer and a map of the city
appears on the monitor. He begins to inspect it carefully. Threepio
and Artoo look over the control panel. Artoo finds something that
makes him whistle wildly.
BEN Plug in. He should be able to interpret the entire
Imperial computer network.
Artoo punches his claw arm into the computer socket and the vast
"Imperial brain network comes to life, feeding information to the little"
"robot. After a few moments, he beeps something."
THREEPIO He says he’s found the main control to the power beam
that’s holding the ship here. He’ll try to make the precise
location appear on the monitor.
The computer monitor flashes readouts.
THREEPIO The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven
locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to
leave.
Ben studies the data on the monitor readout.
BEN I don’t think you boys can help. I must go alone.
HAN Whatever you say. I’ve done more than I bargained for on this
trip already.
LUKE I want to go with you.
"BEN Be patient, Luke. Stay and watch over the droids."
LUKE But he can…
BEN They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer
the same fate as Alderaan. Your destiny lies along a different path
from mine. The Force will be with you … always!
Ben adjusts the lightsaber on his belt and silently steps out of the
"command office, then disappears down a long gray hallway."
Chewbacca barks a comment and Han shakes his head in
agreement.
"HAN Boy you said it, Chewie."
Han looks at Luke.
HAN Where did you dig up that old fossil?
LUKE Ben is a great man.
"HAN Yeah, great at getting us into trouble."
LUKE I didn’t hear you give any ideas…
"HAN Well, anything would be better than just hanging around"
waiting for them to pick us up…
LUKE Who do you think…
Suddenly Artoo begins to whistle and beep a blue streak. Luke goes
over to him.
LUKE What is it?
"THREEPIO I’m afraid I’m not quite sure, sir. He says “I found her,”"
"and keeps repeating, “She’s here.”"
"LUKE Well, who… who has he found?"
Artoo whistles a frantic reply.
THREEPIO Princess Leia.
LUKE The princess? She’s here?
HAN Princess?
LUKE Where… where is she?
HAN Princess? What’s going on?
THREEPIO Level five. Detention block AA- twenty-three. I’m afraid
she’s scheduled to be terminated.
"LUKE Oh, no! We’ve got to do something."
HAN What are you talking about?
LUKE The droid belongs to her. She’s the one in the message.
We’ve got to help her.
"HAN Now, look, don’t get any funny ideas. The old man wants us"
to wait right here.
"LUKE But he didn’t know she was here. Look, will you just find a"
way back into the detention block?
HAN I’m not going anywhere.
"LUKE They’re going to execute her. Look, a few minutes ago you"
said you didn’t want to just wait here to be captured. Now all you
want to do is stay.
HAN Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind.
LUKE But they’re going to kill her!
HAN Better her than me…
LUKE She’s rich.
Chewbacca growls.
HAN Rich?
"LUKE Yes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you were to rescue her, the"
reward would be…
HAN What?
LUKE Well more wealth that you can imagine.
"HAN I don’t know, I can imagine quite a bit!"
LUKE You’ll get it!
HAN I better!
LUKE You will…
"HAN All right, kid. But you’d better be right about this!"
"Han looks at Chewie, who grunts a short grunt."
LUKE All right.
HAN What’s your plan?
"LUKE Uh… Threepio, hand me those binders there will you?"
Luke moves toward Chewbacca with electronic cuffs.
"LUKE Okay. Now, I’m going to put these on you."
Chewie lets out a hideous growl.
"LUKE Okay. Han, you put these on."
Luke sheepishly hands the binders to Han.
"HAN Don’t worry, Chewie. I think I know what he has in mind."
The Wookiee has a worried and frightened look on his face as Han
binds him with the electronic cuffs.
"THREEPIO Master Luke, sir! Pardon me for asking… but, ah… what"
should Artoo and I do if we’re discovered here?
LUKE Lock the door!
HAN And hope they don’t have blasters.
THREEPIO That isn’t very reassuring.
Luke and Han put on their armored stormtrooper helmets and start off
into the giant Imperial Death Star. INT. DEATH STAR – DETENTION
AREA – ELEVATOR TUBE
Han and Luke try to look inconspicuous in their armored suits as they
"wait for a vacuum elevator to arrive. Troops, bureaucrats, and robots"
"bustle about, ignoring the trio completely. Only a few give the giant"
Wookiee a curious glance.
Finally a small elevator arrives and the trio enters.
LUKE I can’t see a thing in this helmet.
"A bureaucrat races to get aboard also, but is signaled away by Han."
The door to the pod-like vehicle slides closed and the elevator car
takes off through a vacuum tube. INT. DEATH STAR – MAIN
HALLWAY
Several Imperial officers walk through the wide main passageway.
They pass several stormtroopers and a robot similar to Threepio but
"with an insect face. At the far end of the hallway, a passing flash of"
"Ben Kenobi appears, then disappears down a small hallway. His"
appearance is so fleeting that it is hard to tell if he is real or just an
illusion. No one in the hallway seems to notice him. INT. DEATH
STAR – INT. ELEVATOR – DETENTION SECURITY AREA
"Luke and Han step forward to exit the elevator, but the door slides"
open behind them. The giant Wookiee and his two guards enter the
old gray security station. Guards and laser gates are everywhere.
Han whispers to Luke under his breath.
HAN This is not going to work.
LUKE Why didn’t you say so before?
HAN I did say so before! INT. DETENTION AREA
"Elevator doors open. A tall, grim looking Officer approaches the trio."
OFFICER Where are you taking this… thing?
Chewie growls a bit at the remark but Han nudges him to shut up.
LUKE Prisoner transfer from Block one- one-three-eight.
OFFICER I wasn’t notified. I’ll have to clear it.
The officer goes back to his console and begins to punch in the
information. There are only three other troopers in the area. Luke and
"Han survey the situation, checking all of the alarms, laser gates, and"
camera eyes. Han unfastens one of Chewbacca’s electronic cuffs
and shrugs to Luke.
Suddenly Chewbacca throws up his hands and lets out with one of
his ear-piercing howls. He grabs Han’s laser rifle.
HAN Look out! He’s loose!
LUKE He’s going to pull us all apart.
HAN Go get him!
The startled guards are momentarily dumbfounded. Luke and Han
have already pulled out their laser pistols and are blasting away at
"the terrifying Wookiee. Their barrage of laserfire misses Chewbacca,"
"but hits the camera eyes, laser gate controls, and the Imperial"
guards. The officer is the last of the guards to fall under the laserfire
just as he is about to push the alarm system. Han rushes to the
"comlink system, which is screeching questions about what is going"
on. He quickly checks the computer readout.
HAN We’ve got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in. Here
it is… cell twenty-one- eight-seven. You go get her. I’ll hold them
here.
Luke races down one of the cell corridors. Han speaks into the
buzzing comlink.
HAN (sounding official) Everything is under control. Situation normal.
INTERCOM VOICE What happened?
"HAN (getting nervous) Uh… had a slight weapons malfunction. But,"
"uh, everything’s perfectly all right now. We’re fine. We’re all fine here,"
"now, thank you. How are you?"
INTERCOM VOICE We’re sending a squad up.
"HAN Uh, uh, negative, negative. We had a reactor leak here now."
Give us a few minutes to lock it down. Large leak… very dangerous.
INTERCOM VOICE Who is this? What’s your operating number?
Han blasts the comlink and it explodes.
HAN Boring conversation anyway. (yelling down the hall) Luke! We’re
going to have company! INT. DEATH STAR – CELL ROW
Luke stops in front of one of the cells and blasts the door away with
"his laser pistol. When the smoke clears, Luke sees the dazzling"
young princess-senator. She had been sleeping and is now looking at
him with an uncomprehending look on her face. Luke is stunned by
her incredible beauty and stands staring at her with his mouth
hanging open.
LEIA (finally) Aren’t you a little short for a stormtrooper?
"Luke takes off his helmet, coming out of it."
LUKE What? Oh… the uniform. I’m Luke Skywalker. I’m here
to rescue you.
LEIA You’re who?
LUKE I’m here to rescue you. I’ve got your R2 unit. I’m here with
Ben Kenobi.
LEIA Ben Kenobi is here! Where is he?
LUKE Come on! INT. DEATH STAR – CONFERENCE ROOM
Darth Vader paces the room as Governor Tarkin sits at the far end of
the conference table.
VADER He is here…
TARKIN Obi-Wan Kenobi! What makes you think so?
VADER A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the
presence of my old master.
TARKIN Surely he must be dead by now.
VADER Don’t underestimate the Force.
"TARKIN The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the"
"universe. You, my friend, are all that’s left of their religion."
There is a quiet buzz on the comlink.
TARKIN Yes.
"INTERCOM VOICE Governor Tarkin, we have an emergency alert in"
detention block AA-twenty-three.
TARKIN The princess! Put all sections on alert!
VADER Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.
"TARKIN If you’re right, he must not be allowed to escape."
VADER Escape may not his plan. I must face him alone. INT. DEATH
STAR – DETENTION AREA – HALLWAY
An ominous buzzing sound is heard on the other side of the elevator
door.
HAN Chewie!
Chewbacca responds with a growling noise.
HAN Get behind me! Get behind me!
A series of explosions knock a hole in the elevator door through
which several Imperial troops begin to emerge.
Han and Chewie fire their laser pistols at them through the smoke
"and flames. They turn and run down the cell hallway, meeting up with"
Luke and Leia rushing toward them.
HAN Can’t get out that way.
LEIA Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route.
"HAN (sarcastically) Maybe you’d like it back in your cell, Your"
Highness.
Luke takes a small comlink transmitter from his belt as they continue
to exchange fire with stormtroopers making their way down the
corridor.
LUKE See-Threepio! See-Threepio!
THREEPIO (over comlink) Yes sir?
LUKE We’ve been cut off! Are there any other ways out of the cell
bay?… What was that? I didn’t copy! INT. DEATH STAR – MAIN
BAY GANTRY – CONTROL TOWER
Threepio paces the control center as little Artoo beeps and whistles a
blue streak. Threepio yells into the small comlink transmitter.
"THREEPIO I said, all systems have been alerted to your presence,"
sir. The main entrance seems to be the only way out; all other
information on your level is restricted.
Someone begins banging on the door.
TROOPER VOICE Open up in there!
"THREEPIO Oh, no! INT. DEATH STAR – DETENTION CORRIDOR"
Luke and Leia crouch together in an alcove for protection as they
continue to exchange fire with troops. Han and Chewbacca are barely
able to keep the stormtroopers at bay at the far and of the hallway.
"The laserfire is very intense, and smoke fills the narrow cell corridor."
LUKE There isn’t any other way out.
HAN I can’t hold them off forever! Now what?
"LEIA This is some rescue. When you came in here, didn’t you have"
a plan for getting out?
"HAN (pointing to Luke) He’s the brains, sweetheart."
Luke manages a sheepish grin and shrugs his shoulders.
"LUKE Well, I didn’t…"
The princess grabs Luke’s gun and fires at a small grate in the wall
"next to Han, almost frying him."
HAN What the hell are you doing?
"LEIA Somebody has to save our skins. Into the garbage chute, wise"
guy.
She jumps through the narrow opening as Han and Chewbacca look
on in amazement. Chewbacca sniffs the garbage chute and says
something.
HAN Get in there you big furry oaf! I don’t care what you smell! Get in
there and don’t worry about it.
Han gives him a big kick and the Wookiee disappears into the tiny
opening. Luke and Han continue firing as they work their way toward
the opening.
HAN Wonderful girl! Either I’m going to kill her or I’m beginning to like
her. Get in there!
Luke ducks laserfire as he jumps into the darkness. Han fires off a
"couple of quick blasts creating a smoky cover, then slides into the"
chute himself and is gone. INT. DEATH STAR – GARBAGE ROOM
Han tumbles into a large room filled with garbage and muck. Luke is
already stumbling around looking for an exit. He finds a small
hatchway and struggles to get it open. It won’t budge.
HAN (sarcastically) Oh! The garbage chute was a really wonderful
idea. What an incredible smell you’ve discovered! Let’s get out of
here! Get away from there…
LUKE No! wait!
Han draws his laser pistol and fires at the hatch. The laserbolt
ricochets wildly around the small metal room. Everyone dives for
cover in the garbage as the bolt explodes almost on top of them. Leia
climbs out of the garbage with a rather grim look on her face.
LUKE Will you forget it? I already tried it. It’s magnetically sealed!
LEIA Put that thing away! You’re going to get us all killed.
"HAN Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I had everything under"
"control until you led us down here. You know, it’s not going to take"
them long to figure out what happened to us.
LEIA It could be worse…
"A loud, horrible, inhuman moan works its way up from the murky"
depths. Chewbacca lets out a terrified howl and begins to back away.
Han and Luke stand fast with their laser pistols drawn. The Wookiee
is cowering near one of the walls.
HAN It’s worse.
LUKE There’s something alive in here!
HAN That’s your imagination.
LUKE Something just moves past my leg! Look! Did you see that?
HAN What?
LUKE Help!
Suddenly Luke is yanked under the garbage.
HAN Luke! Luke! Luke!
Solo tries to get to Luke. Luke surfaces with a gasp of air and
thrashing of limbs. A membrane tentacle is wrapped around his
throat.
LEIA Luke!
Leia extends a long pipe toward him.
"LEIA Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this."
"LUKE Blast it, will you! My gun’s jammed."
HAN Where?
LUKE Anywhere! Oh!!
Solo fires his gun downward. Luke is pulled back into the muck by the
slimy tentacle.
HAN Luke! Luke!
Suddenly the walls of the garbage receptacle shudder and move in a
couple of inches. Then everything is deathly quiet. Han and Leia give
each other a worried look as Chewbacca howls in the corner. With a
rush of bubbles and muck Luke suddenly bobs to the surface.
LEIA Grab him!
Luke seems to be released by the thing.
LEIA What happened?
"LUKE I don’t know, it just let go of me and disappeared…"
HAN I’ve got a very bad feeling about this.
Before anyone can say anything the walls begin to rumble and edge
toward the Rebels.
LUKE The walls are moving!
LEIA Don’t just stand there. Try and brace it with something.
"They place poles and long metal beams between the closing walls,"
but they are simply snapped and bent as the giant trashmasher
rumbles on. The situation doesn’t look too good.
LUKE Wait a minute!
Luke pulls out his comlink.
LUKE Threepio! Come in Threepio! Threepio! Where could he
be? INT. DEATH STAR – MAIN GANTRY – COMMAND OFFICE
A soft buzzer and the muted voice of Luke calling out for See-
"Threepio can be heard on Threepio’s hand comlink, which is sitting"
on the deserted computer console. Artoo and Threepio are nowhere
in sight. Suddenly there is a great explosion and the door of the
control tower flies across the floor. Four armed stormtroopers enter
the chamber.
FIRST TROOPER Take over! (pointing to the dead officer) See to
him! Look there!
A trooper pushes a button and the supply cabinet door slides open.
See-Threepio and Artoo-Detoo are inside. Artoo follows his bronze
companion out into the office.
THREEPIO They’re madmen! They’re heading for the prison level. If
"you hurry, you might catch them."
FIRST OFFICER (to his troops) Follow me! You stand guard.
"The troops hustle off down the hallway, leaving a guard to watch over"
the command office.
THREEPIO (to Artoo) Come on!
The guard aims a blaster at them.
THREEPIO Oh! All this excitement has overrun the circuits of
"my counterpart here. If you don’t mind, I’d like to take him down to"
maintenance.
TROOPER All right.
"The guard nods and Threepio, with little Artoo in tow, hurries out the"
door. INT. DEATH STAR – GARBAGE ROOM
"As the walls rumble closed, the room gets smaller and smaller."
Chewie is whining and trying to hold a wall back with his giant paws.
Han is leaning back against the other wall. Garbage is snapping and
popping. Luke is trying to reach Threepio.
"LUKE Threepio! Come in, Threepio! Threepio!"
Han and Leia try to brace the contracting walls with a pole. Leia
begins to sink into the trash.
HAN Get to the top!
LEIA I can’t
"LUKE Where could he be? Threepio! Threepio, will you come"
in? INT. DEATH STAR – MAIN FORWARD BAY – SERVICE PANEL
THREEPIO They aren’t here! Something must have happened to
them. See if they’ve been captured.
Little Artoo carefully plugs his claw arm into a new wall socket and a
complex array of electronic sounds spew from the tiny robot.
THREEPIO Hurry! INT. DEATH STAR – GARBAGE ROOM
The walls are only feet apart. Leia and Han are braced against the
walls. The princess is frightened. They look at each other. Leia
reaches out and takes Han’s hand and holds it tightly. She’s terrified
and suddenly groans as she feels the first crushing pressure against
her body.
HAN One thing’s for sure. We’re all going to be a lot thinner! (to
Leia) Get on top of it!
LEIA I’m trying! INT. DEATH STAR – MAIN FORWARD BAY –
SERVICE PANEL
"THREEPIO (to Artoo) Thank goodness, they haven’t found them!"
Where could they be?
Artoo frantically beeps something to See-Threepio.
"THREEPIO Use the comlink? Oh, my! I forgot I turned it off! INT."
DEATH STAR – GARBAGE ROOM
"Meanwhile, Luke is lying on his side, trying to keep his head above"
the rising ooze. Luke’s comlink begins to buzz and he rips it off his
belt. INT. DEATH STAR – MAIN FORWARD BAY – SERVICE

"Muffled sounds of Luke’s voice over the comlink can be heard, but"
not distinctly.
"THREEPIO Are you there, sir? INT. DEATH STAR – GARBAGE"

LUKE Threepio! INT. DEATH STAR – MAIN FORWARD BAY –

THREEPIO We’ve had some problems…

DEATH STAR – MAIN FORWARD BAY – SERVICE PANEL
LUKE (over comlink) Shut down all the garbage mashers on the
detention level.
THREEPIO (to Artoo) No. Shut them all down! Hurry!
Threepio holds his head in agony as he hears the incredible
screaming and hollering from Luke’s comlink.
"THREEPIO Listen to them! They’re dying, Artoo! Curse my metal"
body! I wasn’t fast enough. It’s all my fault! My poor master!
"LUKE (over comlink) Threepio, we’re all right! INT. DEATH STAR –"
GARBAGE ROOM
The screaming and hollering is the sound of joyous relief. The walls
"have stopped moving. Han, Chewie and Leia embrace in the"
background.
LUKE We’re all right. You did great.
"Luke moves to the pressure sensitive hatch, looking for a number."
"LUKE Hey… hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit"
number … where are we? INT. DEATH STAR – MAIN FORWARD
BAY – SERVICE PANEL
Threepio looks at the computer panel as Han reads the number.
HAN (over comlink) Three-two-six-eight-two-seven. INT. DEATH
STAR – TRACTOR BEAM – POWER GENERATOR TRENCH
Ben enters a humming service trench that powers the huge tractor
beam. The trench seems to be a hundred miles deep. The clacking
sound of a huge switching devices can be heard. The old Jedi edges
his his way along a narrow ledge leading to a control panel that
connects two large cables. He carefully makes several adjustments in
"the computer terminal, and several lights on the board go from red to"
blue. INT. DEATH STAR – UNUSED HALLWAY
"The group exits the garbage room into a dusty, unused hallway. Han"
and Luke remove the trooper suits and strap on the blaster belts.
"HAN If we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to"
be able to get out of here.
Luke smiles and scratches his head as he takes a blaster from Solo.
"LUKE Well, let’s get moving!"
"Chewie begins growling and points to the hatch to the garbage room,"
as he runs away and then stops howling.
HAN (to Chewie) Where are you going?
"The dianoga bangs against the hatch and a long, slimy tentacle"
works its way out of the doorway searching for a victim. Han aims his
pistol.
"LEIA No, wait. They’ll hear!"
Han fires at the doorway. The noise of the blast echoes relentlessly
throughout the empty passageway. Luke simply shakes his head in
disgust.
"HAN (to Chewie) Come here, you big coward!"
Chewie shakes his head “no.”
HAN Chewie! Come here!
"LEIA Listen. I don’t know who you are, or where you came from, but"
"from now on, you do as I tell you. Okay?"
Han is stunned at the command of the petite young girl.
"HAN Look, Your Worshipfulness, let’s get one thing straight! I"
take orders from one person! Me!
LEIA It’s a wonder you’re still alive. (looking at Chewie) Will
somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?
Han watches her start away. He looks at Luke.
HAN No reward is worth this.
"They follow her, moving swiftly down the deserted corridor. INT."
DEATH STAR – POWER TRENCH
Suddenly a door behind Ben slides open and a detachment of
stormtroopers marches to the power trench. Ben instantly slips into
the shadows as an Officer moves to within a few feet of him.
OFFICER Secure this area until the alert is canceled.
FIRST TROOPER Give me regular reports.
All but two of the stormtroopers leave.
FIRST TROOPER Do you know what’s going on?
SECOND TROOPER Maybe it’s another drill.
"Ben moves around the tractor beam, watching the stormtroopers as"
"they turn their backs to him. Ben gestures with his hand toward them,"
as the troops think they hear something in the other hallway. With the
"help of the Force, Ben deftly slips past the troopers and into the main"
hallway.
SECOND TROOPER What was that?
"FIRST TROOPER Oh, it’s nothing. Don’t worry about it. INT. DEATH"
STAR – HALLWAY
"Luke, Han, Chewbacca, and Leia run down an empty hallway and"
stop before a bay window overlooking the pirateship. Troopers are
milling about the ship. Luke takes out his pocket comlink.
HAN (looking at his ship) There she is.
"LUKE See-Threepio, do you copy?"
"THREEPIO (voice) For the moment. Uh, we’re in the main hangar"
across from the ship.
LUKE We’re right above you. Stand by.
Han is watching the dozen or so troops moving in and out of the
"pirateship. Leia moves towards Han, touches his arm and points out"
the window to the ship.
LEIA You came in that thing? You’re braver that I thought.
HAN Nice! Come on!
"Han gives her a dirty look, and they start off down the hallway. They"
round a corner and run right into twenty Imperial stormtroopers
heading toward them. Both groups are taken by surprise and stop in
their tracks.
FIRST TROOPER It’s them! Blast them!
"Before even thinking, Han draws his laser pistol and charges the"
"troops, firing. His blaster knocks one of the stormtroopers into the air."
"Chewie follows his captain down the corridor, stepping over the fallen"
trooper on the floor.
HAN (to Luke and Leia) Get back to the ship!
LUKE Where are you going? Come back!
Han has already rounded a corner and does not hear.
LEIA He certainly has courage.
LUKE What good will it do us if he gets himself killed? Come on!
Luke is furious but doesn’t have time to think about it for muted
alarms begin to go off down on the hangar deck. Luke and Leia start
off toward the starship hangar. INT. DEATH STAR – SUBHALLWAY
Han chases the stormtroopers down a long subhallway. He is yelling
and brandishing his laser pistol. The troops reach a dead end and are
forced to turn and fight. Han stops a few feet from them and assumes
a defensive position. The troops begin to raise their laser guns. Soon
all ten troopers are moving into an attack position in front of the lone
starpirate. Han’s determined look begins to fade as the troops begin
to advance. Solo jumps backward as they fire at him. INT. DEATH
STAR – SUBHALLWAY
Chewbacca runs down the subhallway in a last-ditch attempt to save
his bold captain. Suddenly he hears the firing of laser guns and
"yelling. Around the corner shoots Han, pirate extraordinaire, running"
"for his life, followed by a host of furious stormtroopers. Chewbacca"
turns and starts running the other way also. INT. DEATH STAR –
SUBHALLWAY
Luke fires his laser pistol wildly as he and Leia rush down a narrow
"subhallway, chased by several stormtroopers. They quickly reach the"
end of the subhallway and race through an open hatchway. INT.
DEATH STAR – CENTRAL CORE SHAFT
Luke and Leia race through the hatch onto a narrow bridge that
"spans a huge, deep shaft that seems to go into infinity. The bridge"
"has been retracted into the wall of the shaft, and Luke almost rushes"
"into the abyss. He loses his balance off the end of the bridge as Leia,"
"behind him, takes hold of his arm and pulls him back."
LUKE (gasping) I think we took a wrong turn.
Blasts from the stormtroopers’ laser guns explode nearby reminding
them of the oncoming danger. Luke fires back at the advancing
troops. Leia reaches over and hits a switch that pops the hatch door
"shut with a resounding boom, leaving them precariously perched on a"
short piece of bridge overhang. Laserfire from the troopers continues
to hit the steel door.
LEIA There’s no lock!
Luke blasts the controls with his laser pistol.
LUKE That oughta hold it for a while.
"LEIA Quick, we’ve got to get across. Find the control that extends"
the bridge.
"LUKE Oh, I think I just blasted it."
Luke looks at the blasted bridge control while the stormtroopers on
the opposite side of the door begin making ominous drilling and
pounding sounds.
LEIA They’re coming through!
"Luke notices something on his stormtrooper belt, when laserfire hits"
the wall behind him. Luke aims his laser pistol at a stormtrooper
perched on a higher bridge overhang across the abyss from them.
"They exchange fire. Two more troopers appear on another overhang,"
"also firing. A trooper is hit, and grabs at his chest."
Another trooper standing on the bridge overhang is hit by Luke’s
"laserfire, and plummets down the shaft. Troopers move back off the"
bridge; Luke hands the gun to Leia.
"LUKE Here, hold this."
Luke pulls a thin nylon cable from his trooper utility belt. It has a
grappler hook on it.
A trooper appears on a bridge overhang and fires at Luke and Leia.
"As Luke works with the rope, Leia returns the laser volley. Another"
"trooper appears and fires at them, as Leia returns his fire as well."
"Suddenly, the hatch door begins to open, revealing the feet of more"
troops.
LEIA Here they come!
"Leia hits one of the stormtroopers on the bridge above, and he falls"
into the abyss. Luke tosses the rope across the gorge and it wraps
itself around an outcropping of pipes. He tugs on the rope to make
"sure it is secure, then grabs the princess in his arms. Leia looks at"
"Luke, then kisses him quickly on the lips. Luke is very surprised."
LEIA For luck!
Luke pushes off and they swing across the treacherous abyss to the
corresponding hatchway on the opposite side. Just as Luke and Leia
"reach the far side of the canyon, the stormtroopers break through the"
hatch and begin to fire at the escaping duo. Luke returns the fire
before ducking into the tiny subhallway. INT. DEATH STAR –
NARROW PASSAGEWAY
Ben hides in the shadows of a narrow passageway as several
stormtroopers rush past him in the main hallway. He checks to make
"sure they’re gone, then runs down the hallway in the opposite"
direction. Darth Vader appears at the far end of the hallway and starts
after the old Jedi. INT. DEATH STAR – MAIN FORWARD BAY
Threepio looks around at the troops milling about the pirateship entry
ramp.
THREEPIO Where could they be?
"Artoo, plugged into the computer socket, turns his dome left and right,"
beeping a response. INT. DEATH STAR – CORRIDOR – BLAST
SHIELDS DOOR
Han and Chewbacca run down a long corridor with several troopers
hot on their trail.
TROOPER Close the blast doors!
"At the end of the hallway, blast doors begin to close in front of them."
The young starpilot and his furry companion race past the huge doors
"just as they are closing, and manage to get off a couple off"
laserblasts at the pursuing troops before the doors slam shut.
TROOPER Open the blast doors! Open the blast doors! INT. DEATH
STAR – HALLWAY LEADING TO MAIN FORWARD BAY
Ben hurries along one of the tunnels leading to the hangar where the
"pirateship waits. Just before he reaches the hangar, Darth Vader"
"steps into view at the end of the tunnel, not ten feet away. Vader"
lights his saber. Ben also ignites his and steps slowly forward.
"VADER I’ve been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. We meet again, at last."
The circle is now complete.
Ben Kenobi moves with elegant ease into a classical offensive
position. The fearsome Dark Knight takes a defensive stance.
"VADER When I left you, I was but the learner; now I am the master."
"BEN Only a master of evil, Darth."
"The two Galactic warriors stand perfectly still for a few moments,"
sizing each other up and waiting for the right moment. Ben seems to
"be under increasing pressure and strain, as if an invisible weight were"
"being placed upon him. He shakes his head and, blinking, tries to"
clear his head.
Ben makes a sudden lunge at the huge warrior but is checked by a
lightning movement of The Sith. A masterful slash stroke by Vader is
"blocked by the old Jedi. Another of the Jedi’s blows is blocked, then"
countered. Ben moves around the Dark Lord and starts backing into
the massive starship hangar. The two powerful warriors stand
"motionless for a few moments with laser swords locked in mid-air,"
creating a low buzzing sound.
"VADER Your powers are weak, old man."
"BEN You can’t win, Darth. If you strike me down, I shall become"
more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
Their lightsabers continue to meet in combat. INT. DEATH STAR –
MAIN FORWARD BAY
"Han Solo and Chewbacca, their weapons in hand, lean back against"
"the wall surveying the forward bay, watching the Imperial"
stormtroopers make their rounds of the hangar.
HAN Didn’t we just leave this party?
"Chewbacca growls a reply, as Luke and the princess join them."
HAN What kept you?
LEIA We ran into some old friends.
LUKE Is the ship all right?
"HAN Seems okay, if we can get to it. Just hope the old man got"
the tractor beam out of commission. INT. DEATH STAR – HALLWAY
Vader and Ben Kenobi continue their powerful duel. As they hit their
"lightsabers together, lightning flashes on impact. Troopers look on in"
interest as the old Jedi and Dark Lord of The Sith fight. Suddenly
Luke spots the battle from his group’s vantage point.
LUKE Look!
"Luke, Leia, Han, and Chewie look up and see Ben and Vader"
emerging from the hallways on the far side of the docking bay. INT.
DEATH STAR – DOCKING BAY
Threepio and Artoo-Detoo are in the center of the Death Star’s
Imperial docking bay.
"THREEPIO Come on, Artoo, we’re going!"
Threepio ducks out of sight as the seven stormtroopers who were
guarding the starship rush past them heading towards Ben and the
Sith Knight. He pulls on Artoo. INT. DEATH STAR – HALLWAY
"Solo, Chewie, Luke, and Leia tensely watch the duel. The troops rush"
toward the battling knights.
HAN Now’s our chance! Go!
They start for the Millennium Falcon.
Ben sees the troops charging toward him and realizes that he is
trapped. Vader takes advantage of Ben’s momentary distraction and
brings his mighty lightsaber down on the old man. Ben manages to
deflect the blow and swiftly turns around.
"The old Jedi Knight looks over his shoulder at Luke, lifts his sword"
from Vader’s then watches his opponent with a serene look on his
face.
"Vader brings his sword down, cutting old Ben in half. Ben’s cloak falls"
"to the floor in two parts, but Ben is not in it. Vader is puzzled at Ben’s"
disappearance and pokes at the empty cloak. As the guards are
"distracted, the adventurers and the robots reach the starship."
"Luke sees Ben cut in two and starts for him. Aghast, he yells out."
LUKE No!
The stormtroopers turn toward Luke and begin firing at him. The
"robots are already moving up the ramp into the Millennium Falcon,"
"while Luke, transfixed by anger and awe, returns their fire. Solo joins"
"in the laserfire. Vader looks up and advances toward them, as one of"
his troopers is struck down.
HAN (to Luke) Come on!
"LEIA Come on! Luke, its too late!"
HAN Blast the door! Kid!
"Luke fires his laser pistol at the door control panel, and it explodes."
The door begins to slide shut. Three troopers charge forward firing
"laser bolts, as the door slides to a close behind them… shutting"
Vader and the other troops out of the docking bay. A stormtrooper
lies dead at the feet of his onrushing compatriots. Luke starts for the
"advancing troops, as Solo and Leia move up the ramp into the"
"pirateship. He fires, hitting a stormtrooper, who crumples to the floor."
"BEN’S VOICE Run, Luke! Run!"
Luke looks around to see where the voice came from. He turns
"toward the pirateship, ducking Imperial gunfire from the troopers and"
races into the ship. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON – COCKPIT
Han pulls back on the controls and the ship begins to move. The dull
thud of laserbolts can be heard bouncing off the outside of the ship as
Chewie adjusts his controls.
"HAN I hope the old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or"
"this is going to be a real short trip. Okay, hit it!"
Chewbacca growls in agreement. EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON

only explanation for the ease of our escape.
HAN Easy… you call that easy?
LEIA Their tracking us!
"HAN Not this ship, sister."
"Frustrated, Leia shakes her head."
LEIA At least the information in Artoo is still intact.
HAN What’s so important? What’s he carrying?
LEIA The technical readouts of that battle station. I only hope
"that when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found. It’s"
not over yet!
"HAN It is for me, sister! Look, I ain’t in this for your revolution, and I’m"
"not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I’m in it for the"
money!
LEIA You needn’t worry about your reward. If money is all that you
"love, then that’s what you’ll receive!"

coming in.
LEIA Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares
about anything… or anyone.
LUKE I care!

at the vast blackness of space.
"LUKE So… what do you think of her, Han?"
"HAN I’m trying not to, kid!"
LUKE (under his breath) Good…
"HAN Still, she’s got a lot of spirit. I don’t know, what do you think? Do"

TARKIN Yes.

"A lone guard stands in a tower high above the Yavin landscape,"
surveying the countryside. A mist hangs over the jungle of twisted
green. INT. MASSASSI – WAR ROOM BRIEFING AREA
Dodonna stands before a large electronic wall display. Leia and
several other senators are to one side of the giant readout. The lowceilinged
"room is filled with starpilots, navigators, and a sprinkling of"
R2-type robots. Everyone is listening intently to what Dodonna is
saying. Han and Chewbacca are standing near the back.
DODONNA The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a
firepower greater than half the star fleet. Its defenses are designed
around a direct large-scale assault. A small one-man fighter should
be able to penetrate the outer defense.
"Gold Leader, a rough looking man in his early thirties, stands and"
addresses Dodonna.
"GOLD LEADER Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub"
fighters going to be against that?
"DODONNA Well, the Empire doesn’t consider a small one-man"
"fighter to be any threat, or they’d have a tighter defense. An analysis"
of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness
in the battle station.
"Artoo-Detoo stands next to a similar robot, makes beeping sounds,"
and turns his head from right to left.
DODONNA The approach will not be easy. You are required to
maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point.
The target area is only two meters wide. It’s a small thermal exhaust
"port, right below the main port. The shaft leads directly to the reactor"
system. A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy
the station.
A murmur of disbelief runs through the room.
DODONNA Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction. The shaft is
"ray- shielded, so you’ll have to use proton torpedoes."
"Luke is sitting next to Wedge Antilles, a hotshot pilot about sixteen"
years old.
"WEDGE That’s impossible, even for a computer."
LUKE It’s not impossible. I used to bullseye womp rats in my Tsixteen
back home. They’re not much bigger than two meters.
DODONNA Man your ships! And may the Force be with you!

OUTPOST – MAIN HANGAR DECK
"Luke, Threepio and little Artoo enter the huge spaceship hangar and"
hurry along a long line of gleaming spacefighters. Flight crews rush
around loading last-minute armaments and unlocking power
couplings. In an area isolated from this activity Luke finds Han and
Chewbacca loading small boxes onto an armored speeder.
"MAN’S VOICE (over loudspeaker) All flight troops, man your"
"stations. All flight troops, man your stations."
Han is deliberately ignoring the activity of the fighter pilots’
preparation. Luke is quite saddened at the sight of his friend’s
departure.
LUKE So… you got your reward and you’re just leaving then?
"HAN That’s right, yeah! I got some old debts I’ve got to pay off with"
"this stuff. Even if I didn’t, you don’t think I’d be fool enough to stick"
"around here, do you? Why don’t you come with us? You’re pretty"
good in a fight. I could use you.
LUKE (getting angry) Come on! Why don’t you take a look around?
"You know what’s about to happen, what they’re up against. They"
could use a good pilot like you. You’re turning your back on them.
HAN What good’s a reward if you ain’t around to use it?
"Besides, attacking that battle station ain’t my idea of courage. It’s"
more like suicide.
"LUKE All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han… guess that’s"
"what you’re best at, isn’t it?"
"Luke goes off and Han hesitates, then calls to him."
"HAN Hey, Luke… may the Force be with you!"
Luke turns and sees Han wink at him. Luke lifts his hand in a small
wave and then goes off.
"Han turns to Chewie who growls at his captain,"
HAN What’re you lookin’ at? I know what I’m doing. INT. MAIN
HANGAR DECK – LUKE’S SHIP
"Luke, Leia, and Dodonna meet under a huge space fighter."
LEIA What’s wrong?
"LUKE Oh, it’s Han! I don’t know, I really thought he’d change"
his mind.
LEIA He’s got to follow his own path. No one can choose it for him.
LUKE I only wish Ben were here.
"Leia gives Luke a little kiss, turns, and goes off."
"As Luke heads for his ship, another pilot rushes up to him and grabs"
his arm.
BIGGS Luke! I don’t believe it! How’d you get here… are you going
out with us?!
"LUKE Biggs! Of course, I’ll be up there with you! Listen, have I got"
some stories to tell…
"Red Leader, a rugged handsome man in his forties, comes up behind"
Luke and Biggs. He has the confident smile of a born leader.
RED LEADER Are you… Luke Skywalker? Have you been checked
out on the Incom T-sixty-five?
"BIGGS Sir, Luke is the best bushpilot in the outer rim territories."
Red Leader pats Luke on the back as they stop in front of his fighter.
RED LEADER I met your father once when I was just a boy. He was
a great pilot. You’ll do all right. If you’ve got half of your father’s
"skill, you’ll do better than all right."
"LUKE Thank you, sir. I’ll try."
Red Leader hurries to his own ship.
"BIGGS I’ve got to get aboard. Listen, you’ll tell me your stories when"
we come back. All right?
"LUKE I told you I’d make it someday, Biggs."
"BIGGS (going off) You did, all right. It’s going to be like old times"
Luke. We’re a couple of shooting stars that’ll never be stopped!
Luke laughs and shakes his head in agreement. He heads for his
ship.
"As Luke begins to climb up the ladder into his sleek, deadly"
"spaceship, the crew chief, who is working on the craft, points to little"
"Artoo, who is being hoisted into a socket on the back of the fighter."
CHIEF This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up. Do you want a new
one?
LUKE Not on your life! That little droid and I have been through a lot
"together. (to Artoo) You okay, Artoo?"
The crewmen lower Artoo-Detoo into the craft. Now a part of the
"exterior shell of the starship, the little droid beeps that he is fine."
Luke climbs up into the cockpit of his fighter and puts an his helmet.
Threepio looks on from the floor of the massive hangar as the
crewmen secure his little electronic partner into Luke’s X-wing. It’s an
emotion-filled moment as Artoo beeps good-bye.
"CHIEF Okay, easy she goes!"
"THREEPIO Hang on tight, Artoo, you’ve got to come back."
Artoo beeps in agreement.
"THREEPIO You wouldn’t want my life to get boring, would you?"
Artoo whistles his reply.
All final preparations are made for the approaching battle. The hangar
is buzzing with the last minute activity as the pilots and crewmen alike
make their final adjustments.
The hum of activity is occasionally trespassed by the distorted voice
of the loudspeaker issuing commands. Coupling hoses are
disconnected from the ships as they are fueled. Cockpit shields roll
"smoothly into place over each pilot. A signalman, holding red guiding"
"lights, directs the ships. Luke, a trace of a smile gracing his lips,"
peers about through his goggles.
"BEN’S VOICE Luke, the Force will be with you."
Luke is confused at the voice and taps his headphones. EXT.

are punishable by death.
Determined to suffocate a growing
"unrest, Supreme Leader KYLO REN has"
silenced all communication between
neighboring systems.
"Led by GENERAL LEIA ORGANA, the"
Resistance has planned a secret
mission to prevent their annihilation
and forge a path to freedom...
EXT. SPACE
"A rich tapestry of stars, reaching beyond all we know."
Two sharp points of a space station enclose the sides of the
frame as we drift backwards into the glowing rectangular
entrance of a DOCKING BAY.
INT. KUAT ORBITAL RING - DOCKING BAY - DAY
A FIRST ORDER TRANSPORT touches down. A wide platform
"descends, revealing a variety of DROIDS."
A GRAPHITE BB UNIT carefully splits off from the group.
INT. KUAT ORBITAL RING - CORRIDOR - DAY
"The graphite BB Unit swerves to avoid a brutish LABOR DROID,"
scraping BB’s spherical side against the wall.
"His head tilts down, checking a scuff in his paint, revealing"
"ORANGE beneath. It’s BB-8, DEEP UNDERCOVER."
He lets out a familiar “uh-oh” and rotates the orange scuff
beneath his head.
INT. SURVEILLANCE DEN - KUAT MOON - DAY
A comm device blinks in a cramped room stacked with recycled
"Imperial gear. ROSE TICO, adventure-worn and battle ready,"
grabs it with gloved hands.
ROSE
"BB-8, you in?"
BB-8 BEEPS affirmative. Rose looks up through the broken roof
at the ORBITAL RING in the sky above. Star Destroyers
protrude from it like spikes on a punk bracelet.
ROSE (CONT'D)
I need eyes on the checkpoint.
INT. KUAT ORBITAL RING - DAY
"BB-8 plugs into a scomp terminal, anxious, tense. Out the"
"window, the glowing KUAT MOON, sun cresting its horizon."
2.
INT. SURVEILLANCE DEN - KUAT SURFACE - DAY
"A holomonitor grid lights up, blurred and scrambled. Rose"
straps electrogoggles over her cracked leather flight helmet.
ROSE
Atta boy.
"ROSE’S POV: The images unscramble, revealing a SECURITY"
CHECKPOINT. The HUD zooms on an approaching DROPSHIP.
ROSE (CONT'D)
Here they come.
EXT. KUAT MOON - SECURITY CHECKPOINT - DAY
The Dropship touches down in a canyon of white and blue
"sedimentary rock, kicking up a storm of silver sand."
STORMTROOPERS shield their eyes as the craft spits out a new
batch of MIGRANT WORKERS from all corners of the galaxy--
aliens and humans submitting to the First Order in exchange
for safety and a scrap of food.
Stormtroopers funnel the migrants toward a Weapons Detector.
We notice FINN disguised in rags among them.
FINN
Checkpoint. Keep your head down.
"A ROBED HUMAN nods, face hidden under dusty headwear."
A bottleneck quickly forms. The ragged aliens bark at each
other in a dozen languages. A beast-like DROVIAN shoves Finn.
FINN (CONT'D)
"Whoa, hey. No trouble here."
The Drovian grabs Finn’s neck with a single hand and lifts
"him up, teeth bared."
FINN (CONT'D)
Trouble. TROUBLE!
The robed human steps between them. POE DAMERON.
POE
"Easy, pal."
Poe pulls a dried three-eyed Peckto fish from a leather pouch
beneath his robe.
3.
POE (CONT'D)
Here. I couldn’t finish it.
"The Drovian eyes the fish, drops Finn, eats."
We notice Poe’s hand on a CONCEALED BLASTER beneath his robe.
"Finn regains his footing, clenching his neck."
FINN
Thanks.
Poe shoots him a tense look. They move toward the scanner.
FINN (CONT'D)
How’ll we know if BB-8 hacked the
mainframe?
The weapons scanner ALARMS. Stormtroopers pull a mangy GOTAL
"out of the group. He pleads, pointing desperately to his"
metallic horns. Blasters FIRE.
POE
We’ll know.
Poe and Finn step into the weapons scanner. Just as they
"enter, the machine SHUDDERS AND CLICKS OFF."
STORMTROOPER #1
We lost power. Hold the line.
"Stormtroopers step in front of the scanner, blasters smoking."
"Finn and Poe eye each other, tense."
INT. KUAT ORBITAL RING - DAY
BB-8’s scomp link stutters and spins. A Stormtrooper drops a
crate of spanners nearby. BB-8 STARTLES as they clatter
across the floor. Droid sweat.
EXT. KUAT MOON - SECURITY CHECKPOINT - DAY
The Stormtrooper smacks the console. It powers up again with
our armed infiltrators standing inside it. No alarm.
STORMTROOPER
"Go on, get moving."
Our guys exhale. Still alive.
4.
EXT. KUAT WORKERS COLONY - DAY
Poe and Finn pass through the border wall to reveal a VAST
MIGRANT SETTLEMENT. Modular housing painted with colorful
"symbols from each worker’s home world, a vibrant melting pot."
"The Orbital Ring looms above, connected to the planet’s"
surface by a massive POWERSHAFT plunged directly into the
core. It glows blue with the ship-fueling energy mined here.
"Poe locks eyes with BISS KOVA, a furry alien watching from a"
machine shop. Biss taps his cheek.
POE
That’s our guy.
"Nearby, a suspicious TUSKEN, face wrapped. The Tusken eyes"
Finn and Poe as they follow Biss Kova inside a hut.
INT. MIGRANT HUT - DAY
"A big-cheeked, hairless ALIEN BABY bounces in a hanging sea"
cow stomach while Biss’ partner DAL KOVA brushes an
unappetizing roast with melted fat.
Rose emerges from behind a beaded curtain in the back.
ROSE
"You said two days, I’ve been here"
two weeks.
FINN
This place doesn’t seem so bad.
ROSE
Good people. Terrible food.
Rose rolls a canvas map onto the table.
ROSE (CONT'D)
This is our access point.
She drops a holochip. It projects the Orbital Ring and the
powershaft plunging from it into the moon’s core.
ROSE (CONT'D)
This powershaft delivers raw ore to
orbital ring. A detonation directly
"into the energy stream, here, will"
cause a chain reaction--
"A blinking holographic light shoots up into the Orbital Ring,"
causing a series of explosions around the entire structure.
5.
POE
--and take the whole thing down.
Finn looks up through the broken roof at the ORBITAL RING
above. A dozen Star Destroyers fueling up.
FINN
Along with their new fleet.
POE
How do we know they haven’t
detected BB-8’s signature?
The alien baby starts to CRY. Rose picks up a rattle and
shakes it.
POE (CONT'D)
There’s a lot we don’t know. That’s
why I voted for the other plan.
FINN
This is when we second guess the
plan? Right now?
Rose sticks a finger into the alien baby’s mouth.
ROSE
We can take out the enemy’s fuel
source and be light years away
before they know what hit them. But
we have to move now.
Finn and Poe regard this odd moment. Rose really has been
down here awhile.
POE
"Okay, let’s blow this thing and go"
home.
EXT. KUAT COLONY - DAY
"Poe, Finn and Rose move past migrant workers toward the"
massive POWERSHAFT BASE extending to the sky.
The Tusken follows them in the deep background.
POE
"BB-8? Don’t worry, I’m alive."
Unlock the powershaft doors and get
ready with that shuttle.
6.
INT. KUAT ORBITAL RING - DAY
BB-8 detatches his scomp link and speeds down the corridor.
EXT. KUAT COLONY - POWERSHAFT BASE - DAY
A trio of space-gray MECHTROOPERS guard the door.
"WHACK! Poe makes short work of the first Mechtrooper,"
knocking him unconscious. Finn and Rose quietly take down the
other two with electric SHOCK PRODS.
"Poe unlatches a device from the Mechtrooper’s belt, throws it"
to Finn. He SCANS IT on the wall.
INT. POWERSHAFT BASE - DAY
A massive cylinder of particle energy rushing upwards.
"Finn, Poe and Rose approach it and gaze up, dwarfed."
POE
We’ll have twenty seconds before
detonation. Give or take.
ROSE
Give or take how long?
Poe hands out three FLYING THERMAL DETONATORS.
POE
Nice and easy. Just like pitching
Pilmetto Stick.
FINN
We didn’t have that...
(Poe activates his charge)
Oh we’re going now?!
Poe underhand tosses his charge into the stream where it
ROCKETS UPWARDS in the particle flow. Rose throws hers.
Finn chucks his like a live grenade and runs.
POE
(into comm)
"BB-8, bombs are away. We’ll meet"
you at the relay point.
7.
INT. MAINTENANCE SHUTTLE DOCK - DAY
"BB-8 rolls into the droid slot of a tiny Maintenance Shuttle,"
old and forgotten.
The ship POWERS UP.
EXT. KUAT COLONY - POWERSHAFT BASE - DAY
Our heroes exit through the maintance door...
...to find themselves face-to-face with a platoon of
STORMTROOPERS and MECHTROOPERS.
STORMTROOPER
Drop your weapons!
Migrant workers crane their necks from the village. The
masked Tusken lurks among them.
"Poe eyes the orbital ring, anticipating the explosion."
POE
"Distraction in three, two, one...now!"
"Poe dives, rolls, head covered...but nothing happens."
INT. KUAT ORBITAL - COMMAND CENTER - DAY
A FIRST ORDER OFFICER rushes to alert steely ADMIRAL VONN.
Screen graphics show a contained blast in the powershaft.
OFFICER
Blast shields have contained the
"explosion, Admiral. All systems"
stable.
"Vonn looks down at the glowing Kuat moon below, scoffs."
ADMIRAL VONN
Their outdated tactics are pitiful.
EXT. KUAT COLONY - POWERSHAFT BASE - DAY
"Rose and Finn look up at the Orbital Ring, fully intact."
POE
Any second now.
Suddenly a high-pitched WAIL spins them around.
8.
The HOODED TUSKEN steps forward. Blades of blue light flash
from its gloved hands.
It’s holding a DUAL LIGHTSABER.
"The Tusken TAKES DOWN EVERYTHING IN ITS PATH, lithe and"
deadly with the blade.
"Finn, Rose and Poe duck and FIRE AWAY until they are"
"surrounded by bodies, blasters smoking."
The Tusken’s mask hits the ground.
It’s REY.
Not the girl we last saw. A grown woman. Powerful. Strong.
FINN
What are you doing here?
Rey spins and BLOCKS A LASER BLAST we didn’t see coming. Her
"robes fall from her shoulders, revealing a battle-ready"
outfit of ALL BLACK.
REY
A simple “thank you” would do.
"She THROWS THE DOUBLE-BLADE LIKE A BOOMERANG, ducks behind a"
"power regulator as the spinning saber slices all in its path,"
then rises in time to CATCH IT.
"This is a new weapon of her own design, made from the pieces"
of Anakin’s broken lightsaber and her own staff. She wields
it with grace.
"Poe ducks behind a generator, yells through lasers at Rey."
POE
You shouldn’t have come here.
REY
You’d rather be killed?
POE
"If it means you’re safe, yeah."
There’s something more behind those words.
REY
Now’s not the time.
POE
Definitely not the time.
9.
"She FORCE PUSHES a pack of eight, sending them clattering."
"The Migrant Workers point to Rey in awe, whispering,"
"reverent. The children cheer, speaking a word they all know."
MIGRANT CHILDREN
Jedi! Jedi!
More Stormtroopers flood into the square--
--but the MIGRANTS BLOCK THEIR PATH TO PROTECT REY. Some
throw rocks. Others swing with hammers and tools.
It’s inspiring. A promise of revolution.
POE
"Rey, we gotta go!"
"Rey hesitates, wanting to fight alongside these people."
REY
I have to help them!
Poe eyes more troop transports and INCOMING TIE FIGHTERS.
POE
Not here. Not now.
"Rey knows he’s right, but it kills her inside. She"
reluctantly follows her friends through the blast door.
"Finn moves to follow them, but his ankle is grabbed by a"
"FALLEN STORMTROOPER, helmet blasted open."
They lock eyes. RECOGNITION. A memory from long ago.
Finn pulls free and continues on. But he’s SHAKEN.
INT. KUAT ORBITAL - COMMAND CENTER - DAY
An Officer races to Admiral Vonn.
ADMIRAL VONN
What happened down there?
OFFICER
"The last Jedi is with them, sir."
Vonn’s confidence turns to fear.
ADMIRAL VONN
Alert the Knights of Ren.
10.
EXT. POWERSHAFT CORE - DAY
"Rey, Poe, Finn and Rose race toward a MAINTENANCE TURBOLIFT"
that runs the length of the powershaft to the ring above.
POE
(into comm link)
BB-8 we’re coming up to you! Plan’s
gone sideways.
EXT. SPACE
"BB-8 has already left the Orbital Ring in the shuttle, on his"
"way down to their rendezvous point on the planet’s surface,"
per the plan. He BEEPS incredulously.
EXT. POWERSHAFT CORE - DAY
Poe looks up at the ring above.
POE
We’re gonna need another ship.
"His eyes settle on THE ECLIPSE, a colossal star destroyer"
"docked just above them, an ivory pirate ship in space."
REY
You’re not serious.
FINN
That’s a Eclipse Class Dreadnaught.
You can’t fly--
POE
I can fly anything.
Rose hacks into the turbolift. The glass door opens.
ROSE
We’re in.
INT. TURBOLIFT - DAY
"The door SLIDES SHUT, cutting off the sound."
ROSE
Clench. Everything.
"The turbolift capsule ROCKETS UP INTO THE TUBE, traveling"
from the planet’s surface to the Orbital Ring in seconds.
11.
INT. KUAT ORBITAL RING - FUELING DOCK
The Turbolift door opens to find the stern of the Eclipse
"Dreadnaught right in front of them, miles wide."
Thick fuel lines attach to the propulsion engines. GLIDE
ROVERS shuttle supplies to the ship.
REY
You sure about this?
POE
Nope.
ROSE
We had better odds on Raxus Prime.
FINN
"That was not my fault, you need to"
let Raxus Prime go.
They hop into a Glide Rover and SPEED OFF.
INT. OBSERVATION TOWER - DAY
Admiral Vonn watches the Glide Rover race toward the Eclipse.
ADMIRAL VONN
Where are they going?
The Glide Rover disappears inside the docked destroyer.
Admiral Vonn cracks slightly as their plan dawns on him.
ADMIRAL VONN (CONT'D)
They can’t possibly.
Admiral Vonn leans over a FIRST ORDER TECH.
ADMIRAL VONN (CONT'D)
How many men on that ship?
FIRST ORDER TECH
"Just the bridge crew, sir. The rest"
are on dock leave.
INT. ECLIPSE DESTROYER - BRIDGE
A massive navigational bridge dense with FIRST ORDER CREW.
A laser blast spins them around. Rose cocks her heavy weapon.
Finn seals the door.
12.
POE
Who’s in charge here?
DECK OFFICER
(brave)
I am.
POE
Great. I’m your new pilot.
(improvising)
Where does the pilot sit?
"Rey loses patience, waves her palm toward the Officer."
REY
You will set a course for the
Nirauan System.
DECK OFFICER
Set a course for the Nirauan System!
"The Crewmen turn and take their positions at the console,"
mind-tricked en masse.
"Poe and Rey take the helm, pressing buttons, guessing."
REY
Cold start the engines. We can jump
right to hyperspace if we overheat
the laser cannon drive.
POE
The exhaust will spill over--
REY (CONT'D)
--into the propulsion
systems. We can freeze the
chamber.
"Poe looks to Rey as they flip switches, a gleam in his eye."
POE (CONT'D)
Don’t you see? You and I? How we--
REY
Not the time.
Finn sits at a massive control board with a hundred buttons.
FINN
"Okay, I’m going to need very"
specific instructions.
Rose goes to work at the NAV CONSOLE.
13.
ROSE
Shields up. Setting calculations
for lightspeed.
POE
Let’s go!
ROSE
Don’t rush me. I mess this up and
we’ll fly right into the sun.
Finn taps a screen in front of him. The ship’s EXTERIOR
LIGHTS click on.
FINN
I found the lights. I turned on the
lights!
"One of the Crewmen SNAPS OUT OF HIS MIND TRICK, eyes Finn."
CREWMAN
Who are you--
WHACK! Finn knocks him out cold.
FINN
Let’s get somewhere else fast!
POE
Working on it...
Poe eases his hands into the steering rig.
POE (CONT'D)
Who uses an inverted control yoke?
EXT. KUAT ORBITAL - SPACE
The Eclipse roughly disengages and SCRAPES ITS WAY OUT. Fuel
"conduits unhinge and SPIT BLUE ENERGY, slicing through the"
dock’s infrastructure.
The ship’s exterior lights blink on and off in patch grids.
Heavy cannons FIRE on the Eclipse’s shields.
INT. ECLIPSE DESTROYER - BRIDGE - SPACE
"Poe leans back, the craft dips DOWN."
14.
REY
The black empty part is where we
should be pointed!
POE
I’m trying! Everything’s backwards!
Finn looks out the window at the planet rising into view as
they tilt further down.
FINN
(mocking)
“I can fly anything.”
Poe gains control of the craft’s trajectory but not its axis.
They are INVERTING. The planet ROLLS from the bottom of the
massive front window to the top.
REY
"Okay, we’re rolling now."
POE
Do we have the droid?
EXT. SPACE
"BB-8’s Maintenance craft is HIT, burning, engineless, fifty"
feet from the dock. He’ll never make it.
REY (ON COMM)
BB-8 now!
BB-8 has to act.
"He EJECTS HIMSELF from the droid socket, floats fifty feet"
"through cold empty space, passes through the oxygen shield"
and LANDS INSIDE THE HANGAR with a clank.
INT. ECLIPSE DESTROYER - BRIDGE - DAY
BB-8 BEEPS affirmative on the commlink.
REY
We got him!
Rose’s console flashes.
ROSE
Good for lightspeed!
Rey leans past Poe and SHOVES the hyperdrive helve forward.
Bars of light STRETCH OUT BEFORE THEM.
15.
EXT. KUAT ORBITAL RING - SPACE
The Eclipse blurs and VANISHES. Silence.
"We TILT UP, stars raining down... WHOOMMMM. A jagged,"
sinister ship appears from hyperspace.
KNIFE 9. Shaped like an arrowhead with adjustable wings. We
follow it back toward the Orbital Ring...
EXT/INT. KUAT ORBITAL - EXTERNAL LANDING AREA - SPACE
"Knife 9 lands on an exposed landing pad, protected by a"
quantum shield from the cold dangers of space.
The KNIGHTS OF REN appear from their ship.
"HATTASKA REN, the leader, armored and caped in black. OTT REN"
"and LORL REN seem to work as a duo. JAEDEC REN is the rogue,"
his mask evoking an angry ghost.
Hattaska eyes the scene in studied silence. He turns his
"ominous, masked gaze to Admiral Vonn, here to meet him."
ADMIRAL VONN
W-we uploaded a veil cipher to the
droid. You’ll have her location the
moment a probe is within range.
Hattaska Ren draws his Darksaber AND CUTS VONN DOWN.
A few Stormtroopers instinctively raise their weapons. The
other Knights RAISE THEIR HEAVY BLASTERS.
"Officers and Stormtroopers back away. Tense, afraid."
"The Knights holster their weapons and return to their ship,"
leaving Admiral Vonn’s body in their wake.
CUT TO:
EXT. CORUSCANT - DAY
A dense cloud layer pierced with skyscrapers.
We follow a SECURITY CRAFT down through the fog to reveal the
"city, unrecognizable from its halcyon days."
New structures built atop the deco architecture of the Old
"Republic, growing older as we descend to the decrepit streets"
below--sedimentary layers of progress.
16.
EXT. CORUSCANT - IMPERIAL BOULEVARD - DAY
The Security Craft lands on a broad avenue rife with despair.
"Immigrants from a thousand systems, all seeking a better"
future for their children.
The Cruiser unloads a squad of eight Stormtroopers on
hovering NIGHTSISTER SPEEDERBIKES. They disappear down long
"alleys, spreading out into the populace."
One buzzes past a dirty propaganda billboard with the
familiar First Order symbol and a message: JOIN TODAY.
Someone has painted DON’T above the JOIN.
"A street kid, DADE, 12, eyes a pair of patrolling"
Stormtroopers as they rough up a limbless alien.
"He picks up a piece of broken cement, aims, throws. It hits"
"the Trooper in the head. Both spin, blasters up. But the kid"
is long gone.
A BANTHA HORN sounds on high.
"Dade races through plumes of smoke, past buildings with"
"shocks of Old Republic-era technology, revealing..."
EXT. MONUMENT SQUARE - DAY
A massive open plaza connected by a web of boulevards. The
"FIRST ORDER CAPITOL towers over it, a jagged structure"
balancing on the surface like a spinning top.
Thousands are gathered here. All eyes are on a dais where
"CAPITOL GUARDS hold a ragged, hooded figure before the crowd."
"The people look to the sky at a HOLOGRAM OF CHANCELLOR HUX,"
four stories tall. Dade weaves closer.
CHANCELLOR HUX (HOLOGRAM)
"Today, another conspirator stands"
charged with treason.
"The Guards remove the conspirator’s hood, revealing BISS KOVA,"
our alien on the ground from the Kuat Colony.
CHANCELLOR HUX (HOLOGRAM) (CONT'D)
Though support for his cause has
"all but vanished, let this day"
remind us of the consequences for
defying our Supreme Leader.
The Capitol Guards lead Biss Kova to a guillotine with a
hissing LIGHTBLADE poised above. He stares silently ahead.
17.
CHANCELLOR HUX (HOLOGRAM) (CONT'D)
"Kylo Ren is not without pity, just"
as the traitor before you is not
without remorse. And so he offers
to spare this man’s life in
exchange for the location of the
Resistance Base.
Biss Kova remains defiant. Hux’s hologram grows irritated.
BISS KOVA
Kofa rebiva tora famlia...
CHANCELLOR HUX (HOLOGRAM)
So be it.
Biss Kova is placed in the lightblade guillotine.
BISS KOVA
Kofa rebiva tora famlia...
Kofa rebiva tora famila...
A woman in the crowd covers Dade’s eyes. He peels her fingers
"away, an anger burning within."
The lightblade FALLS.
INT. CAPITOL CORRIDOR - DAY
"CHANCELLOR HUX, hair streaked with gray, looks down at the"
thousands gathered in Monument Square.
The people are a distant blur from here.
"Bootheels click, revealing COMMANDER SELLIK, Hux’s second in"
military command.
COMMANDER SELLIK
Sir? They’re here.
INT. CAPITOL WAR ROOM - DAY
"A clawed hand reaches into a silver tureen of BABY SHAAKS,"
huddling together for warmth. We follow the squealing animal
"into the mouth of LORD GHERLID, an alien with razor teeth."
"He sits at a table of GALACTIC WARLORDS--tribal, wealthy,"
coated in elaborate robes and stolen jewels.
"Chancellor Hux speaks to them, nostrils flared at the smell."
18.
CHANCELLOR HUX
"I assure you, the stolen Destroyer"
will be found. Our probe droids are
scouring the galaxy as we speak.
LORD GHERLID
(mouth full)
A Dreadnaught class warship just
"slipped through your fingers, Hux."
Your words don’t inspire confidence.
CHANCELLOR HUX
A lone signal won’t be difficult to
find. Our transmissions blockade
has silenced millions of systems.
LORD GHERLID
"You can silence planets, not"
people. There have been uprisings.
We must not allow the seeds of
revolution to take root.
CHANCELLOR HUX
The First Order will punish those who
defy your rule. Submit your youth for
conditioning. They will teach their
elders the rule of law.
"JOR NULT, a nasty dreadlocked Weequay."
JOR NULT
"It’s Skywalker they believe in, not"
"the law. And his apprentice, this"
"girl, this Jedi. She’s become a"
symbol of hope.
"RAYKAR SHEN, a species with curved spider fangs for teeth."
RAYKAR SHEN
The people believe she will destroy
"you, Hux. And your Master."
CHANCELLOR HUX
"Kylo Ren is no Master, certainly"
not mine.
"UGGMOT, a shapeless Noid, pounds the table with his tiny hands."
UGGMOT
(subtitles)
We must kill the last Jedi!
19.
CHANCELLOR HUX
The Knights of Ren have been
dispatched to eliminate her.
LORD GHERLID
Our fate in the hands of zealots?
"You ask for our confidence, yet"
provide nothing to inspire it.
Where is Kylo Ren?
CHANCELLOR HUX
The Supreme Leader will return when
he acquires the knowledge he seeks.
"The warlords eye each other, not satisfied with that."
JOR NULT
When?
"Hux seethes, speaking through his teeth."
CHANCELLOR HUX
Soon.
EXT. MUSTAFAR - DAY
"The terrain is obsidian-like, black and reflective. Jagged"
mountains spike in the distance.
A cloaked figure in tattered robes rises into frame.
"KYLO REN, bearded and weary. He checks the stars for"
"navigation, climbs over a rock precipice..."
...to reveal VADER’S ABANDONED CASTLE in the distance.
"A drone droid, VX-20, floats just behind him."
KYLO
Stay here.
INT. VADER’S CHAMBER - NIGHT
"A forgotten, decrepit cathedral. Crumbling. Pieces of"
"structure litter the ground, untouched for decades."
"Kylo lights his red crossguard lightsaber, holds it up as a"
torch. Tiny creatures scurry at the disturbance.
"A haunting WIND blows against his cheek, chilling him."
20.
KYLO
Leave me alone.
LUKE (VO)
This is where the dark path leads.
An empty tomb.
LUKE SKYWALKER’S VOICE. Haunting his nephew like a spirit.
KYLO
And where did your path lead?
You’re a ghost.
LUKE (VO)
"I know what you’re searching for,"
Ben. Your Master promised you
"strength, but you feel hollow."
KYLO
Soon I will be more powerful than
any Jedi. Even you.
LUKE (VO)
Are you sure?
"Kylo SNAPS, spins and swings his lightsaber at empty space."
"With a billow of cold wind, Luke’s spirit is GONE."
LUKE (VO) (CONT'D)
"Go home, Ben...go home to Leia..."
"Kylo is shaken. But on the altar beyond, the artifact he came"
here to find.
A SITH HOLOCRON.
"He kneels before it. Holds out his palm, channels the Force."
"The three sides of the pyramid pull away, revealing an energy"
within. It grows in intensity and PROJECTS A HOLOGRAM.
"EMPEROR PALPATINE, recorded decades ago."
EMPEROR PALPATINE (HOLOGRAM)
Lord Vader. Young Skywalker will
"soon be ours, I have foreseen it."
But we must prepare for the
unforeseen. Should he strike me
"down, you will take him to the"
Remnicore System. There you will
"find Tor Valum, Master of the Sith"
Lord who instructed me.
21.
The Holocron’s blue light swirls RED. It emits a laser that
SCANS KYLO’S BODY.
EMPEROR PALPATINE (HOLOGRAM) (CONT'D)
Here the son of Skywalker will
acquire a great ability--beyond
what you could hope to command in
"your damaged state. With it, he"
will harness the untapped power of
Mortis. At last we will realize--
The holocron ALARMS--Kylo Ren is not Darth Vader. Palpatine’s
image stutters.
EMPEROR PALPATINE (HOLOGRAM) (CONT'D)
(breaking up)
-- the d-destiny...po-potential--
A blast of RED LIGHTNING shoots from the pyramidal device into
Kylo’s eyes.
The invasive pulse of energy SPREADS OVER HIS FACE like a
"cancer. Horrible, raw purple veins streak through his skin."
"He SCREAMS in deep, unbearable pain."
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - KORILEV - DAY
A pair of blue eyes SNAP OPEN.
LEIA
Ben.
"LEIA ORGANA grips a stone wall, regaining balance."
"Her hair is long and grey, her robes white. A wise and"
"elegant leader, Leia has suffered more loss than a human can"
endure. But she remains a rock in a raging river.
She stands overlooking a terrain of rainforest dusted with
"crisp white snow. KORILEV, the Resistance’s secret base."
She senses a presence behind her.
LEIA (CONT'D)
Speak.
CHEWBACCA (OS)
BRWWWGGHHGHGH!!!
"CHEWBACCA approaches with LT. CONNIX, wounded in battle since"
we last saw her. She now has a visible scar.
22.
CONNIX
"The team has returned, General."
LEIA
Mission accomplished?
CONNIX
Not exactly.
Connix nods to the sky beyond.
Leia turns to see the ECLIPSE DESTROYER descending to
"planetfall over the snowy jungle, escorted by X-Wings."
They look like flies next to it.
INT. ECLIPSE DESTROYER - BRIDGE - DAY
Leia storms onto the bridge as the First Order Officers are
escorted out in handcuffs.
FIRST ORDER OFFICER
You are in strict violation of the
Corellian Accords!
POE
"Yeah, put it on my tab."
Rose rips the Officer’s ID BARS off his uniform.
ROSE
You mind? I collect these.
CONNIX
"What should we do with them,"
General?
LEIA
Cook them dinner. They look thin.
FIRST ORDER OFFICER
The punishment for your act of
rebellion will be swift--
The doors shut in his face.
LEIA
Scan the ship. This thing could be
crawling with enemy troops.
"(to Poe, speaks louder)"
"But our team didn’t consider that,"
did they?
23.
POE
"Come on, tell me you haven’t always"
wanted one of these.
Leia gives him a look. Insufferable.
LEIA
Prepare for evacuation. We’re
leaving.
POE
What? Why?
LEIA
You stole a Star Destroyer.
ROSE
I disabled their homing beacon.
We’re free and clear.
LEIA
Would you bet your life on that?
"That stops them both. Leia looks past them to Rey, in a"
"corridor off the bridge, alone."
LEIA (CONT'D)
Go.
Leia approaches Finn.
LEIA (CONT'D)
How’s she doing?
FINN
Hard to tell. Maybe you can talk to
her?
LEIA
She doesn’t need a master right now.
She needs a friend.
INT. ECLIPSE DESTROYER - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
"Finn approaches Rey, tentative."
FINN
You okay?
REY
I failed.
24.
FINN
Don’t say that. They know our
tactics. We’ve been fighting this
war for too long.
REY
"Those people, the children. I saw"
hope in their eyes.
FINN
They believe in you. We all do.
Those words add more weight to Rey’s heavy shoulders.
REY
I can’t be who they need me to be.
I’m not strong enough.
FINN
That’s not true.
REY
Every night I wake up screaming.
"Every night, another bad dream."
FINN
Is it him?
REY
There’s something between us. I
can’t explain it.
FINN
You have to shut him out. He can’t
"change, it’s too late."
REY
It’s never too late to change. You
taught me that.
"Chewbacca BRAYS, excited. He’s looking out a small"
rectangular porthole into the hull of the ship.
FINN
"What is it, buddy?"
INT. ECLIPSE DESTROYER - WEAPONS ARSENAL - DAY
"Chewie opens the blast door, revealing a mile-long arsenal of"
"DECOMMISSIONED IMPERIAL WEAPONRY. Ships, walkers, urban"
"assault vehicles, mounds of heavy artillery."
Finn’s eyes light up.
25.
FINN
This is enough firepower to take
the Capitol.
(calls out)
"Poe, you need to see this!"
Poe and Rose join them on the overlook. It’s a game changer.
POE
See? When have I ever come back
empty handed?
(slaps Finn’s back)
This. This was the plan.
ROSE
Was it?
FINN
We have ships. Weapons. All we need
is an army.
POE
How? Nobody can hear us. We’re in
the dark.
We push in on Rey...those words resonating with her...
REY
We don’t have to be.
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY
"Rey opens the ancient Jedi text from Ach-To, laid out on the"
"holochess table. Finn, Poe, Rose, Chewie gathered around."
REY
The Jedi had a communications
system. Before the Old Republic. It
was powered by a nexus beneath the
temple.
Sketches of a TOWER in the old Jedi Temple on Coruscant.
Light flowing from the spire into space.
REY (CONT'D)
"A Force beacon, engineered to call"
the outlying systems to war.
FINN
No way it still works.
26.
POE
Old Republic tech is better than
the junk we have today.
ROSE
That frequency pre-dates the Empire
by a thousand years. The First
Order’s blockade couldn’t disrupt
the signal.
FINN
It’s worth a shot.
They look to Poe. The de-facto leader.
POE
Anything’s worth a shot.
(Chewie ROARS)
"Yeah, I hope so too. Rey?"
Rey hesitates for a reason she doesn’t yet understand. A
"dark, ominous feeling."
POE (CONT'D)
Rey.
She snaps back to them.
REY
Hope is all we have left.
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - JEDI DOJO - DAY
"WHACK! A wooden bo-stick hits a pillar, coughing dust."
Light pours through an open sinkhole onto an elaborate wooden
"JEDI SPARRING POST. Extensions on all sides, like branches of"
"a tree. It MOVES--rotating at the base, limbs spinning."
"Rey combats it with aggressive elegance, BLINDFOLDED. She"
"spins, ducks, leaps, climbing while fighting."
THUMP. A swinging post connects with Rey’s back. She hits the
"ground hard, winces in pain."
LUKE’S VOICE (VO)
Your pain is an illusion.
REY
It isn’t actually.
She braces herself and ATTACKS THE POST again. A double flip
and Rey STICKS THE LANDING.
27.
But then she FALTERS. Sensing a disturbance...
EXT. FIRST ORDER CAPITOL - LANDING PAD - NIGHT
A pair of porcine UGNAUGHTS push a levitating stretcher away
from the TIE Silencer.
"On it, KYLO, in worse shape than we left him, damaged veins"
stretching down his neck.
INT. MEDICAL BAY - NIGHT
"Kylo screams on an operating table, surrounded by MEDICAL"
DROIDS. Layers of Mandalorian Iron are smelted to his face.
A discomfiting SIZZLE as they work. Kylo grits his teeth.
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - JEDI DOJO - DAY
Rey touches her cheek. Feeling a sharp but distant pain.
INT. MEDICAL BAY - NIGHT
Kylo screams as a jolt of electricity flows into the iron on
"his face, finishing the job."
He is suddenly WRACKED BY A VISION...
A MOUNTAIN
Snow on the jagged peaks. A TEMPLE older than all known time.
AN ANCIENT CHAMBER
"Two massive thrones built into the rock. A WELL OF LIGHT,"
pulsing from deep below.
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - JEDI DOJO - DAY
Rey is wracked by the same vision...but it continues...
A DARK FIGURE
"Hooded, masked. Kylo Ren. He activates his red lightsaber,"
facing off with Rey before the two thrones.
"They fight, vicious, intense."
With a sharp swing Kylo STRIKES HER DOWN.
28.
BACK TO REY
"She tears off the blindfold, breathless."
LUKE’S VOICE (VO)
What did you see?
REY
I saw a mountain. Two thrones in
the rock. Kylo Ren was...changed.
LUKE SKYWALKER steps into the light. A more tangible form of
"Force Ghost, similar to his projected self on Crait."
LUKE
You saw the future.
REY
Kylo saw it too. I could feel him.
Like he was...there with me.
LUKE
Where?
REY
Mortis.
"Luke turns grave. He sits, as Obi-Wan once sat beside him."
LUKE
What do you know of Mortis?
REY
It’s an ancient place. From a time
"before the Jedi, before the Sith."
"Two thrones, two powerful beings."
"One of darkness, the other of"
"light. Together, they brought"
balance.
(disbelief)
But it’s a myth.
LUKE
"So was I, if you remember."
Luke is almost present now. All traces of blue light are gone.
LUKE (CONT'D)
Beneath the Temple of Mortis lies a
power beyond anything the Jedi have
ever known. If Kylo reaches the
"Temple, all we’ve fought for will"
be lost. You have to confront him.
29.
REY
You want me to...kill Leia’s son?
LUKE
The Force guides us toward balance.
It doesn’t always show us what we
want to see.
"Rey scoffs, petulant, angry."
REY
“Balance”. Dark suffocates the
light. Light extinguishes the dark.
Over and over. How is that balance?
LUKE
I know that anger. I had it. My
father had it too.
REY
So says my master. And his master
"before him. A thousand masters, so"
eager to tell us how to live.
She looks through an arched opening at the Resistance Base
"below. FINN AND ROSE, calibrating a grappling cannon...POE"
AND CHEWIE working on the Falcon...
REY (CONT'D)
I spent my whole life wanting a
family. Now I’ve got one. I won’t
abandon them.
LUKE
"The Force is speaking to you, Rey."
REY
Maybe I’m not who it thinks I am.
LUKE
Who are you?
REY
I’m no one.
LUKE
"If that’s what you believe, the"
last Jedi is dead.
Rey sets her practice staff alongside a line of others.
REY
Maybe he is.
30.
INT. MEDICAL BAY - NIGHT
Kylo’s medical slab rises vertical. He looks into a mirror at
"his altered face--half covered with smelted iron, a monster."
KYLO
Finish it.
"A NEW MASK lowers onto his head and locks into place,"
"spitting steam. We don’t see the front of it, not yet."
A strip of glowing buttons light up the underside of his
forearm. The Med Droid presses a code. The helmet beeps.
MED DROID
Breathe.
"He does. A new sound, different than Vader’s. Gutteral. Deep."
INT. CHANCELLOR HUX’S CHAMBER - NIGHT
Ornate drapes and an indoor fountain. A huge throne-like
chair faces the city through a massive circular window.
"Hux removes his trenchcoat, pointed hat. Catches himself in"
"the mirror, touches the streak of grey hair."
He peers into a glass case at an object of his affection--a
"LIGHTSABER, resting on a pedestal. A collector’s item. He"
gazes at it with envy.
Hux removes a few coins from his pocket. Places one on the
table. Extends his hand...
...and tries to USE THE FORCE TO MOVE IT. It doesn’t budge.
His face grows red from trying.
CHANCELLOR HUX
Nnnnnnnggghhh...
KYLO (OS)
(voice distorted)
Has all been well in my absence?
"Hux STARTLES, embarrassed. Kylo’s masked face is in shadow."
CHANCELLOR HUX
Supreme Leader. You’ve returned. If
I’d known--
KYLO
I don’t need grand displays and
processions. Or titles. Chancellor.
31.
Kylo steps into the light. The new mask is reminiscent of his
"first but sharper, nastier. SCARIER."
KYLO (CONT'D)
My knights tell me the girl was
within your grasp.
CHANCELLOR HUX
Apparently your knights took it
upon themselves to deal with my
General’s failure.
KYLO
And how should I address your
failure?
Hux turns whiter. Takes a small step back.
CHANCELLOR HUX
What happened to your--
KYLO
"She’s beloved, isn’t she?"
CHANCELLOR HUX
Belief is the solace of peasants.
"The people cling to folklore, but"
they fear the First Order.
KYLO
They fear ME. Soon I will command
the Force in ways unseen since the
Ancients.
CHANCELLOR HUX
The power described in the Sith
Texts. You’ve found it?
KYLO
It is within my reach. The ability
to destroy a planet will be...
insignificant.
CHANCELLOR HUX
What are your orders?
KYLO
"Find the Resistance, wipe them out."
CHANCELLOR HUX
And the girl?
KYLO
Leave her to me.
32.
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY
A HOLOGRAM OF THE CAPITOL lights up.
"Poe stands before the Resistance leadership, Leia nearby."
POE
"As you know, the First Order has"
silenced communication between all
neighboring systems. The source of
the blockade is a transmission
jammer deep in the First Order
"Capitol on Coruscant, here."
"The Capitol hologram BLINKS, zooms. A CUBE within."
POE (CONT'D)
So far we’ve been unable to find a
"weakness. No thermal exhaust port,"
"no oscillator. In other words,"
they’re onto us.
Leia smiles. He’s great.
POE (CONT'D)
Our forces are too depleted to
"mount a direct assault, but we’ve"
found an alternative.
The Capitol hologram dissipates to make way for a new
"structure: THE JEDI TEMPLE, a familiar five-spired building."
POE (CONT'D)
"An analog system, from the days of"
the Old Republic.
"Schematics of an ANCIENT MACHINE, powered by Kyber crystal."
POE (CONT'D)
A small team will activate the beacon
and summon the galaxy to war.
The hologram demonstrates--a light SHOOTS FROM THE CENTER
SPIRE and connects fifty other planets like dots.
POE (CONT'D)
When they succeed...the rest of us
will be ready.
"Finn steps forward, eyes alive."
FINN
"I’ll lead the team, General."
33.
ROSE
"I’ll lead the team, General. But"
I’ll let him think he’s doing it.
"Leia eyes Rey, sensing her conflict."
LEIA
Rey?
REY
"They’re looking for me, it’s"
dangerous enough as it is.
(conflicted)
I can’t go with you.
"Poe’s smile fades. Leia doesn’t press it, reading the room."
LEIA
Prepare to evacuate. We’ll
reconvene at the rendezvous point.
ON R2-D2 AND C-3PO
on the edges of the room. R2 BEEPS.
C-3PO
Coruscant? Finally a good idea from
those scrambled circuits of yours.
Coruscant will be quite pleasant
this time of year.
R2 garbles and rolls off. C-3PO follows.
C-3PO (CONT'D)
"Yes, a properly refined city will"
be welcome after hoveling down here
like a Gundark.
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - CORRIDOR - DAY
Poe catches up with Rey.
POE
Hey. What was that about?
REY
I have to bring an end to all this.
I have to confront him.
POE
Mmmhmm. You’re just gonna “confront
him”? Who talks like that?
34.
REY
Jedi do. I’m new to this.
POE
"Okay, I’m going with you."
REY
No. I have to go alone.
POE
Is that in your book too? Where is
this confrontation going to happen?
REY
Mortis. In the unknown regions.
POE
Mortis is a myth.
REY
It isn’t. I saw it.
POE
Oh you saw it. And how do plan on
finding it?
"Rey hesitates, unsure."
REY
I’ll...figure it out.
"She walks away. Poe follows, determined."
POE
"Hey. Look, I know you think"
I’m wasted air on any
"mission, Master Jedi--"
REY (CONT'D)
Please stop calling me that.
POE (CONT'D)
"--but the thing is, I know"
someone who can find the
system you’re looking for.
REY (CONT'D)
If it’s one of your Flight
"Academy friends, I swear--"
POE (CONT'D)
It’s not one of those guys.
But those guys are great.
REY (CONT'D)
--because they are unreliable
at best. And I am being nice.
POE (CONT'D)
"She’s a navigator, lives on"
"Bonadan. Force sensitive, like you."
(off her look)
Not exactly like you. Spice diggers
used to pay her to find deposits on
asteroids.
35.
REY
Do you trust her?
POE
"She’s a little off, but if this"
"place exists, she can find it."
Rey softens. Poe is standing closer than he’s ever been.
POE (CONT'D)
"Hey. I get it. No attachments, Jedi"
"path, I’ve read that story too."
But...
(catches himself)
I’m just saying you don’t have to
do this alone.
ON LEIA
"Through layers of pilots, notices Rey and Poe in the"
corridor. Recognizes the romantic tension.
Her knowing look quickly turns to concern.
ON POE AND ROSE
Finn tightens a bolt on the grappling cannon. A loud CLANK
"startles him. He closes his eyes, left hand shaking."
ROSE
Hey. It’s okay.
Finn’s past has followed him for years. Memories of friends
kidnapped and conditioned to serve.
FINN
One of the Stormtroopers on Kuat. I
"knew him. We trained together, when"
we were kids. He looked so scared.
I remember that feeling.
ROSE
I don’t think that feeling ever
goes away.
FINN
I can’t let more of them end up
like me. It has to stop.
Rose puts a calming hand on his. He breathes easier.
ROSE
That’s what we’re fighting for.
36.
INT. KYLO REN’S CHAMBER - NIGHT
"Kylo gazes down at Darth Vader’s burned mask, speaking once"
more to the grandfather he never knew.
KYLO
I understand you now. Your
weakness. Your pain. You allowed
love to cloud your judgement. I
will succeed where you failed.
He grips Vader’s mask and exits onto his balcony.
"A thousand feet up, a layer of clouds below, stars above."
Kylo holds Vader’s mask out over the edge...
...and lets it go. It plunges below the clouds and SHATTERS.
INT. TIE SILENCER - NIGHT
"Kylo Ren lowers into the cockpit. His drone, VX-20, settles"
into the data dock over his right shoulder.
KYLO
"(amplified, distorted)"
Set a course for Remnicore.
VX-20 beeps in affirmation.
INT. WAR ROOM - NIGHT
Hux watches Kylo’s TIE Silencer fly into the starfield above.
CHANCELLOR HUX
Goodbye Ren.
Commander Sellik approaches.
COMMANDER SELLIK
"Sir, one of our probes picked up the"
droid’s signal. We’ve found them.
CHANCELLOR HUX
"Ready my ship, I want to witness"
their extinction myself.
COMMANDER SELLIK
Shall I inform the Supreme Leader?
37.
CHANCELLOR HUX
No. Let Kylo and the girl fulfill
the empty promises of their ancient
religion. In the end they’ll
"destroy each other, as Jedi and"
Sith always have. Then we will
"rise. Strong, decisive. Ready to"
bring true order to the galaxy.
"Commander Sellik eyes Hux, unnerved by him."
CHANCELLOR HUX (CONT'D)
Prepare the attack.
EXT. RESISTANCE BASE - SPACECRAFT HANGAR - DAY
Buzzing energy as the Resistance evacuates the base. Poe and
Chewbacca load up the Millennium Falcon.
POE
Because I’m not sending her out
"there alone, that’s why."
(BRAAGGGHH!!!)
Will you trust me?
"Nearby, Rose and Finn load up the PHANTOM HAWK, her junky but"
"reliable ship, pieced together from parts."
"Rose has the hood open, tinkering with the innards."
ROSE
"This is a Corellian hyperdrive. R2,"
do we have a keycode for this?
R2-D2 projects a hologram of KEYCODES. Finds a match.
ROSE (CONT'D)
This is every hyperdrive key in the
old Imperial fleet. They still use
"these. R2, where’d you get this?"
R2-D2 beeps.
C-3PO
I told you to erase the data from
Bespin’s central computer. You
don’t know where it’s been.
"Finn looks past the droids to REY, loading up the Falcon with"
Poe and Chewie. He approaches her.
FINN
Guess this is goodbye.
38.
REY
Don’t say that.
FINN
You’ve come a long way since Jakku.
REY
So have you.
(eyes the Resistance)
They trust you. They should.
"Finn and Rey HUG. They say nothing, but it means everything."
"Poe appears, BB-8 rolling alongside him."
POE
We should get outta here before--
(awkward intrusion)
"Oh, I uh --"
Finn pulls Poe in strongly and hugs him.
FINN
(to Rey)
Take care of him.
REY
I will.
Finn swallows his emotion and forces himself away to the
"Phantom Hawk, where Rose sweats under the engine bay."
ROSE
"No, hop onboard, relax. I’ll handle"
all of this...work.
Rey watches Finn board the ship. Nothing but love for her friend.
"Beyond the Phantom Hawk, Leia approaches."
REY
Leia. I...
LEIA
You don’t have to say it.
Right. Force-sensitive.
REY
I can save your son.
LEIA
"I believed that once, like you."
39.
REY
There’s good in him.
LEIA
There’s good in all of us. But the
boy I knew is gone.
(a heartbreaking beat)
"Rey, be careful."
REY
Master Luke trained me well.
LEIA
Some things you can’t train for.
"Rey follows Leia’s eyes to POE, caught staring at her just as"
Chewbacca tosses him a wrench.
REY
I don’t-- What?
LEIA
Come on. I know how complicated
this is.
REY
I can’t. There are rules. Jedi
rules.
LEIA
(scoffs)
"Written by who? Some old man, a"
thousand years before you were born.
Leia speaks to Rey like her own daughter.
LEIA (CONT'D)
"My whole life, I heard one word."
Balance. I never really understood
what it meant. Until the first time
I saw you. I heard that word again.
Like it was whispered to me.
Balance.
Leia takes her hand. Intimate. Close.
LEIA (CONT'D)
You’re not like my father. Or my
brother. You’re new. Whatever
"happens, remember: the Force chose"
"you, Rey. Your story isn’t written"
by anyone else.
40.
BOOOOOMMMM. A massive blast shakes the mountain. Dust
"crumbles, alarms blare. Massive blips on radar screens."
RESISTANCE TECH
Resurgent Class Star Destroyer
"detected, we’re taking fire!"
EXT. SPACE - KORILEV ORBIT
The Finalizer bears down on the planet while two other FIRST
"ORDER STARSHIPS arrive from lightspeed, flanking it."

Hux looks out at the glowing planet beyond.
CHANCELLOR HUX
Decimate any ships leaving the

(to Weapons Op)
Charge the primary weapon!
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - SPACECRAFT HANGAR - DAY
BOOOOOM!! Alarm lights FLASH. Pilots run for their ships.
COMMAND INTERCOM (VO)
Emergency evac. All personnel and
craft to Rendezvous Point Crimson.
RESISTANCE GUARDS surround Leia.
LEIA
Route all unarmored transports to
"the Eclipse, it’s our only way out."
Leia locks eyes with Rey as she goes.
POE
Rey! We have to go!
(she’s focused on Leia)
Rey!
Rey races up the Falcon ramp. Poe yells to Finn.
POE (CONT'D)
Go! Get out of here!
Finn and Rose hurry into the Phantom Hawk.
41.
Transports and fighters fly out of the hangar toward the
"waiting Eclipse, hidden in a deep canyon."
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY
Rey and Poe instinctively spin into the pilot seats. Chewie
doesn’t like it. He ROARS.
POE
"I know, I know. Your seat."
Chewie bangs the walls. That’s his damn chair.
REY
(flipping switches)
Can we talk about this later?
INT. PHANTOM HAWK - DAY
Rose reverses their ship out of the hangar. Another BLAST
from the Star Destroyer pulses the shields.
C-3PO
I’m afraid our shields cannot
withstand a superlaser of this
magnitude--
ROSE
"Tell me the odds, Threepio. I like"
numbers.
Finn watches the Millennium Falcon rise out of the sinkhole.
FINN
"Good luck, Rey."
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY
Rey answers Finn as if he’s next to her.
REY
(to Finn)
You too.
"The Falcon rises out of the deep sinkhole to the surface,"
where the jungle is ON FIRE. Laser blasts pound the mountain
"base from above, relentless."
"Just inside the shield barrier, transports and fighters fly"
"into the open docking bays of the Eclipse Destroyer, like"
"bees into a hive, safe inside."
42.
INT. ECLIPSE DESTROYER - BRIDGE - DAY
"Leia takes her command position on the bridge, now fully"
manned by Resistance personnel.
CONNIX
"Shields are at eight percent,"
General. We can’t wait any longer.
She takes one last look at Korilev. Another home taken from her.
INT. FINALIZER DESTROYER - BRIDGE - DAY
Hux’s pale face glows from superlaser fire.
WEAPONS OPERATOR
"Primary weapon charged, sir."
CHANCELLOR HUX
Fire!
INT. PHANTOM HAWK - SPACE
Finn and Rose feel the heat of the explosion all around them
as the light bends ahead and they ESCAPE INTO HYPERSPACE.
INT. ECLIPSE DESTROYER - BRIDGE - DAY
"Leia closes her eyes, feeling the loss of the men and women"
left behind as the Eclipse MAKES THE JUMP TO LIGHTSPEED.
EXT. KORILEV - DAY
The Eclipse VANISHES in an instant.
The Finalizer’s superlaser finally cracks the shields. The
base ERUPTS.
The entire planet EXPLODES IN HELLFIRE. From the ring of
"destruction, the Millennium Falcon rockets out into space."
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - SPACE
The ship RATTLES. Mountainous chunks of space rock spin away
"from the exploded planet, creating a field of obstacles all"
around them. Chewbacca WHINES.
43.
POE
I know!
(to Rey)
We can’t make the jump with all
this debris.
REY
Neither can that Destroyer.
POE
"Chewie, cloak our signal!"
BOOOOOOMMMM! The Falcon quakes. Damage alarms blare.
They swerve and dodge through chunks of destroyed planet--
"some pieces still intact with mountains, jungle valleys and"
waterfalls frozen by the cold of space.
A familiar ship enters frame in blazing pursuit.
The dark and jagged KNIFE 9.
INT. KNIFE 9 - COCKPIT
Jaedec Ren at the helm. Ott and Lorl flank him in elevated
"gunchairs. In the deep background, Hattaska floats in an"
"electro-oxygen chamber, tubes weaving around his body."
"Ott and Lorl unload waves of targeted blasts on the Falcon,"
exploding remnants of planet when they miss the ship.
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
BOOM!! The Falcon is hammered with laser fire. Relentless.
POE
Who’s this?
Rey eyes the pursuing ship on the rearview graphic monitor.
REY
Let me fly.
POE
I’ve got the yoke. My yoke!
REY
My SHIP!
Chewie ROARS. Both wrong.
44.
EXT. PLANET DEBRIS FIELD - SPACE
Knife 9 pursues the Falcon through the spinning pieces of
"Korilev, trying to avoid collision without losing the target."
The Falcon gets close to one of the planetary fragments and
"buzzes the surface, dodging blasts as it flies UP THE FACE OF"
A FROSTED JUNGLE MOUNTAIN IN SPACE.
"The horizon spins as the fragment spirals above both ships,"
spinning out on its chaotic trajectory--suddenly the mountain
is inverted above them with the blackness of space below.
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
"Poe fires on the jagged mountain peak, hanging above them now"
like a stalactite.
"The mountain peak blasts apart, sending projectiles spinning"
into the path of the pursuing craft.
"Knife 9 is HIT by a sharp piece of rocky mountaintop, sending"
it wildly off course.
REY
We’re clear!
POE
Punch it!
Light bends ahead and they ROCKET INTO HYPERSPACE.
INT. KNIFE 9 - COCKPIT
"Alarms blare as they spin out. Jaedec Ren regains control,"
righting the ship. The Falcon is gone.
"Jaedec approaches the electro-oxygen chamber, eyeing Hattaska"
through the glass. Wires protrude from his mask into the main
computer. He’s in some kind of induced sleep.
JAEDEC REN
"What do you see, brother?"
Jaedec places hand on the glass. Suddenly Hattaska does the
"same, hand flat on the glass against Jaedec’s."
"Lorl and Ott look on, waiting for the answer. Jaedec’s head"
"tilts up. He nods, removes his hand from the glass."
JAEDEC REN (CONT'D)
Set a course for Bonadan.
45.
EXT. REMNICORE - NIGHT
Kylo’s TIE Silencer enters the atmosphere of a cold black
planet veined with silver.
It touches down on a ridge overlooking a wide valley of
obsidian-like terrain. Frozen trees in windswept shapes.
Floes of white lava.
EXT. REMNICORE FORTRESS - NIGHT
Kylo approaches an ancient stone military battlement consumed
by time. Skeletons of fallen WAR BEASTS litter the terrain.
"Whatever battle happened here, it ended centuries ago."
He passes empty suits of armor. Robes draped over broken
shields. Flags flutter in the wind.
"A Sith helmet on the ground, skull visible within. A reminder"
"that while the Jedi live on, the Sith become dust."
His tracking beacon flashes a single red dot.
Lifeform detected.
INT. REMNICORE FORTRESS - COURTYARD - NIGHT
"The door OPENS TOWARD US, revealing Kylo, hand extended."
He enters a circular chamber stacked with broken spacecraft
"parts, ancient military technology and piles of silver ore. A"
glowing white fire crackles in a stone pit.
A voice WHISPERS as he draws closer to the flame.
TOR VALUM (OS)
Reveal yourself.
Kylo’s lightsaber IGNITES. A reflex action.
KYLO
I seek the Sith Master Tor Valum.
TOR VALUM (OS)
I am no master.
"The mountain of junk MOVES. From it, as if disguised within,"
"comes TOR VALUM, 7000-years-old, an alien of unknown origin."
"Spindly and tense, sinew and muscle pulled tight."
TOR VALUM (CONT'D)
But I was once called Tor Valum.
46.
Kylo remains steadfast. Dominant.
KYLO
You trained Darth Plagueis?
TOR VALUM
That name means nothing to me.
"Kylo’s lightsaber FLASHES in anger, settling inches from Tor"
"Valum’s taut, leathery skin."
KYLO
Does your life?
"Tor Valum regards Kylo, smiles with sharp teeth."
TOR VALUM
You threaten me with death. How
amusing.
KYLO
You are weak. I feel nothing.
TOR VALUM
You feel what I allow you to feel.
Child.
The creature extends a long finger. Pointing to Kylo’s mask.
TOR VALUM (CONT'D)
Reveal yourself.
"Kylo removes his mask. His face is veined, corrupted worse"
than we remember. Tor Valum appears oddly entertained.
TOR VALUM (CONT'D)
Mmmmm. You wish to obtain the power
of those who came before. Take your
place among the Gods of Mortis.
KYLO
I do.
TOR VALUM
"To rule the galaxy without armies,"
without starships.
KYLO
Yes.
TOR VALUM
Yet you fear the frailty of your
vessel. You need this power.
47.
Kylo’s jaw tenses. He nods.
TOR VALUM (CONT'D)
Kneel before me.
"Miraculously, Kylo KNEELS."
TOR VALUM (CONT'D)
You call yourself a Sith. But the
"Sith are unrepentant, remorseless."
"You’re haunted by the past, your"
very existence.
KYLO
I have no regrets.
TOR VALUM
You lie. Until you sever yourself
"from the past, your fate will be"
the same as theirs.
Tor Valum motions to the battlefield in the valley below.
Empty JEDI KNIGHT ARMOR. Vacant SITH MARAUDER ARMOR beside
it. Withered husks of animals and men.
TOR VALUM (CONT'D)
The Living Force is nourishment.
"The more one consumes, the stronger"
one becomes. To take life...is to
cheat death.
The creature lifts his body with his arms and WALKS ON THEM.
Kylo eyes his strange new master.
KYLO
Teach me.
CUT TO:
EXT. BONADAN - SUNSET
The Falcon descends into a valley of cylindrical mountains
rising over water spotted with junk boats. This planet exists
"in permanent sunset, lit by its bustling NIGHTMARKETS."
The Falcon lands on a multi-leveled DOCKING ARRAY. It feels
"like a tower of lilypads, a visiting ship on each."
48.
EXT. BONADAN - DOCKING ARRAY - SUNSET
"Poe argues with two stumpy Langoles, OKE and SOKKO, at the"
base of the Millennium Falcon’s ramp.
POE
I know it’s a Corellian light
freighter but you’re gonna say it’s
a Praddor Cruiser in the registry.
That’s why I winked when I gave you
the money. Understand what’s
happening here?
"Oke and Sokko CHATTER in their alien language, voices rising."
POE (CONT'D)
"Okay, which one of you is in charge"
because you’re both the size of
children where I come from.
Rey exits the Falcon. Poe stops her.
POE (CONT'D)
"Whoa, whoa. You can’t go out like"
that. You look like a
(low)
Jedi.
REY
What’s that supposed to mean?
POE
Just tone it down a little.
(to Chewie)
"Chewie, will you straighten these"
guys out?
Chewbacca takes over negotiations with the Langoles.
"The landing pads ROTATE AND DESCEND, lowering the Falcon’s"
platform to water level. An elegant and fluid system.
Poe leads Rey toward a TOOTHLESS MERCHANT selling jewelry and
sari-like robes.
POE (CONT'D)
How much for this one?
"Rey takes out her credits. The Merchant shakes her head,"
closes Rey’s hand around the money.
REY
Thank you.
49.
BRAAAGGGHH!! Chewbacca has one of the Langoles lifted off the
"ground, using him as a bargaining chip against the other one."
POE
"Aw, Chewie! Negotiate. Persuade,"
quietly.
Chewbacca shakes his head and WHINES: I am.
EXT. BONADAN NIGHTMARKET - SUNSET
Rey and Poe step off a junk boat ferry into a sensory
"overload of lights, smells and tastes."
Aliens and humans haggle over prices of artisan crafts and
live animals. Packs of teenagers eat bizarre street food from
market stalls. Kids laugh at buskers and street performers.
A FREAK SHOW HAWKER beckons them to a curtained booth.
HAWKER
Come witness the frothing eye of
Loyyil Karn!
"They walk among the oddities and wonders, undercover. Rey’s"
colorful sari gives her an exotic elegance we’ve never seen.
She uncomfortably adjusts her incognito hooded pullover.
POE
I like it. You look like a local.
REY
You’ve been here before?
POE
With my grandfather. I used to
"sail, right out there. You’ve never"
seen so many lights.
He eyes her.
POE (CONT'D)
What do you remember?
Rey digs for a memory before her abandonment.
REY
My father and I would build
starships out of wood. They could
fit in your hand.
50.
POE
Anything else?
REY
I remember love. That’s why I
waited for so long.
(doubt creeps in)
But I must have imagined it. They
were no one.
Poe looks at her in the setting sunlight. Wishing he could
"change the past for her, but unable."
POE
No one is no one.
Rey takes that in. Then she spots a trio of MECHTROOPERS
scanning the crowd ahead.
"Poe follows her eyes, puts his hand on his blaster."
REY
No.
"She pulls Poe into a market stall, eyeing them through"
"hanging cloth. An old, female UTAI PEDDLER barks at them to"
taste the spicy clawfish soup she’s selling.
UTAI PEDDLER
Cassasan! Nep. Nep.
POE
No. Not hungry.
"She holds out the steaming ladle to Poe, encouraging."
UTAI PEDDLER
(offended)
Depee casssasan!
One of the Mechtroopers looks in their direction.
POE
Okay. Here. Just shh.
Poe drinks from the soup ladle.
REY
Mmm. See? Mmmm.
His face turns red. He COUGHS from the intense heat. The Utai
and her friends LAUGH.
51.
UTAI PEDDLER
Arno tow di?
POE
"No, it’s good."
"He coughs harder, getting worse. The Mechtrooper moves in"
"their direction, hearing the violent coughing..."
"Rey grabs Poe by the shirt and pulls him into a KISS, hiding"
his face behind her headscarf.
The Mechtrooper sees the two lovers from afar while the Utai
women applaud in the background. He moves on.
Rey and Poe pull apart. He takes a moment to recover. He’s
never kissed a Jedi.
REY
Did it work?
POE
"I mean, I think so."
Rey looks past him at the Mechtroopers walking away.
POE (CONT'D)
Oh. So that wasn’t--
REY
(lying)
No.
"They eye each other, wishing the Force could stop time."
REY (CONT'D)
We should--
POE
Right. Yeah.
INT. BONADAN - NAVIGATOR’S DEN
A circular room draped with colorful silks. Devoted FOLLOWERS
"sit around the edges, smoking all manner of pipes and"
vaporizer devices. An ELECTROHARPIST plays ethereal music.
"NOMI, a tiny alien child who appears no older than 5, sits on"
a pillow at the center of a floor made of marbles.
She consults quietly with an ALIEN COUPLE on the brink of
"divorce. They cry, touching foreheads."
52.
Rey and Poe enter through hanging beads.
POE
Easy on the details. She doesn’t
have to know who or why. Just what.
Nomi senses Rey and smiles past the couple in front of her.
NOMI
A Jedi. The last.
All eyes turn to Poe and Rey.
POE
Or this. We can do it this way.
"Nomi nods to the couple before her, touching their chests."
NOMI
Go.
(to Rey)
Come. Sit. The Jedi and the man.
Conspiratorial asides in the gallery. Rey and Poe walk
barefoot over the marbles fitted into the stone floor.
NOMI (CONT'D)
You seek a place.
REY
A planet.
NOMI
Mortis is the place.
REY
"Yes, I saw it in --"
NOMI
The mouth on the Jedi stops and the
mind makes the picture. The Force
fills the Jedi and reveals the
destination.
Poe nods encouragingly. Rey closes her eyes and breathes.
"The tiny marbles in the floor RISE INTO THE AIR, taking the"
three-dimensional shape of the galaxy all around them.
NOMI (CONT'D)
The destination is very old. The
first to know the Force. The first
where the good was done. And the
evil too.
53.
"Rey opens her eyes, surrounded by FLOATING MARBLES."
REY
Which one?
NOMI
The destination lies within.
POE
"Look, we’re in a hurry--"
NOMI
The man will not speak.
"The marbles swirl above Rey, a galaxy around her."
NOMI (CONT'D)
The eyes close. Only the Jedi knows
the path...
Nomi’s voice grows distant as Rey falls deep into meditation.
FLASH TO:
MORTIS
Snow on the peak. Autumn leaves in the valley below.
NOMI (VO) (CONT'D)
There the two will meet. Drawn
together by the Force.
THE TEMPLE
"Two thrones in the rock. A well of light, pulsing from deep"
within the mountain below.
NOMI (VO) (CONT'D)
The dark side and the light.
A CLOAKED FIGURE
Standing before Rey. His mask unmistakable.
NOMI (VO) (CONT'D)
There she will make the sacrifice.
THE FLASH OF A RED LIGHTSABER
"Jarring, violent as Kylo Ren STRIKES REY DOWN."
Rey SNAPS OUT OF HER VISION.
54.
POE
"Wait, what?"
A flat black oval stone at the center of the marble array
falls from orbit into Nomi’s palm.
POE (CONT'D)
"What do you mean, sacrifice?"
"She hands it to a rabbit-sized astroscrivener, GEB, seated at"
a tiny easel. He paints a starmap of the chosen location.
NOMI
The Jedi must go alone.
POE
"No, hold on a second."
Geb the Astroscrivener tears the drawn planetary map off his
"easel, limps to Rey and hands it over."
REY
Thank you.
POE
We’re not leaving. What did she
see?
(to Rey)
What did you see?
NOMI
The Jedi will make the journey. The
journey will answer the question.
POE
What question? Can we all just take
a deep breath and talk about this.
Rey stops at the door.
REY
Is there another path?
"Nomi looks at Rey with wide, unreadable eyes."
NOMI
There is always another path.
EXT. CORUSCANT - NIGHT
Rose’s Phantom Hawk descends through the skyscraper canyons.
"The city plunges underground below them, dense and alive,"
like roots of a tree.
55.
INT. PHANTOM HAWK - NIGHT
Finn and Rose observe through the cockpit panel.
FINN
So many people living underground.
ROSE
Rich folks don’t spend much time
thinking about what they’re
standing on.
Finn eyes the darkened JEDI TEMPLE in the distance.
FINN
That’s it. Drop R2 and Threepio at
street level.
C-3PO
I’m afraid all my knowledge of
Coruscant is limited to the upper
levels.
R2-D2 BEEPS.
C-3PO (CONT'D)
Elitist? Where do you even learn
these words?
EXT. CORUSCANT - NIGHT
"The Phantom Hawk rises from the streets, leaving R2 and C-3PO"
behind. The ship ascends on the darkened roof of a skyscraper
"in skeletal stage, lights off."
INT. ABANDONED SKYSCRAPER - NIGHT
"An unfinished floor, beams and girders only. Rose and Finn"
"open a case, fold out their GRAPPLING CANNON."
THUNK! THUNK! Rose bolts the gun into the concrete floor.
Finn attaches a sniper scope to the muzzle of the cannon.
Aims at the top of the JEDI TEMPLE SPIRE a quarter-mile away.
FINN
Ready?
The grappling cannon FIRES. Sticks. They harness in.
56.
ROSE
"You don’t have a fear of heights,"
do you?
FINN
"It’s not the height I’m afraid of,"
it’s hitting the ground.
ROSE
So you’ll be fine if we don’t fall.
They unlatch and ZIPLINE A THOUSAND FEET above the city.
INT. JEDI TEMPLE SPIRE - NIGHT
Finn and Rose crash through the shattered window and
"unbuckle. The chamber is barely recognizable, long forgotten."
FINN
(into comm)
"R2, you have that message ready?"
EXT. JEDI TEMPLE COURTYARD - NIGHT
"R2-D2 beeps, leading C-3PO through the decrepit courtyard at"
the base of the temple. A sad reminder of a better time.
C-3PO
This doesn’t look like the Jedi
Temple to me.
They move past oil drum fires and covetous looks from the
"city’s DWELLERS, the poorest of the poor."
C-3PO (CONT'D)
What do you mean I stand out?
(R2 beeps)
Gold is not ostentatious. Leave the
vocabulary to me you glorified
mechanic.
A VAGABOND ALIEN steps in front of Threepio. Several others
"appear from behind, rubbing their hands across his wares."
C-3PO (CONT'D)
Excuse me! Oh my.
A STROBE LIGHT blinds them.
STORMTROOPER VOICE
Get away from that droid!
57.
"The dwellers scatter. The strobe shuts off, revealing the"
light and the audio recording came from R2-D2.
C-3PO
Thank goodness. Don’t ever leave me
again.
"R2-D2 leads them through a crumbled wall inside the temple,"
revealing the GRAND ENTRANCE HALL--gothic arched ceilings
over a massive Kyber Crystal mounted like a holy sculpture.
INT. JEDI TEMPLE SPIRE - NIGHT
Rose and Finn run their fingers along the smooth walls. Rose
finds a pyramid-shaped socket.
FINN
Found one.
Finn finds another identical panel across the room. He
unwraps a pair of CRYSTALS. Throws her one.
ROSE
No!
She CATCHES IT.
ROSE (CONT'D)
Five thousand year old Kyber crystal.
Very rare. You hand it to me.
FINN
Sorry.
They insert their crystals into the sockets.
FINN (CONT'D)
Ready? Three two...
CLICK. The spire RUMBLES. The floor opens. A HUGE COPPER
"MACHINE rises up, Old Republic tech around a central"
"conducting chamber. Power flows through it, humming. Grand."
"Then it SHORTS OUT, sparks fall. The machine goes dark."
ROSE
Can’t it be easy? Just one time.
58.
EXT. REMNICORE - NIGHT
"A three-tusked GRONK BOAR squeals, struggling to run in"
place. The animal’s eyes roll back as the Living Force is
"drained into Kylo’s open hand, reducing it to a husk."
"Kylo opens his eyes. His face has more life, his eyes"
"brighter, scars receded. Empowered. Grateful."
Tor Valum smiles like a parent who just taught his child to
ride a bicycle.
KYLO
More.
TOR VALUM
There is no more. You have consumed
all that remains.
A wind cuts from an ice cave beyond. A faint glow within.
KYLO
What’s down there?
TOR VALUM
A vergence.
KYLO
I can feel it.
TOR VALUM
There is more within. Go.
Kylo puts on his mask and enters.
INT. VERGENCE CAVE - NIGHT
The light from Kylo’s red saber refracts in the vast walls.
The cave is empty. But not silent.
There is a sound from the darkness. BREATHING.
From the shadows comes the hulking presence of DARTH VADER.
"Kylo stands his ground, lightsaber up, unsure what is"
"happening. Vader ignites his own weapon, swings..."
"Kylo BLOCKS. Vader strikes again, forcing the descendant of"
Skywalker to defend himself.
It’s a brutal fight. Intense lightsaber combat between two
iconic villains.
59.
But Kylo is no match. Vader STRIKES HIM DOWN. He screams in
"pain, falls to the ground."
Kylo struggles to remove his mask. Breathless. Looks down at
his chest wound. It no longer exists.
He is alone.
EXT. REMNICORE - NIGHT
"Kylo staggers from the cave. Angry, disoriented."
KYLO
Where is Mortis?
TOR VALUM
The well of the Living Force. The
source of the galaxy’s birth.
KYLO
I want to be stronger than those
who came before. Where is it?
Kylo’s eyes are alive. Hungry.
TOR VALUM
You are not worthy of its power.
Not yet.
"Kylo reaches out his arm and FORCE HOLDS Tor Valum, delving"
deep into his mind...
KYLO
Where is Mortis?
"Tor Valum’s smile goes away. He grits his teeth, pained as"
Kylo probes and extracts.
TOR VALUM
Release me.
KYLO
I see it.
TOR VALUM
Betrayer...I gave you knowledge...
KYLO
"A mountain in winter. No, fall."
TOR VALUM
I gave you everything...
60.
KYLO
I know. You’ve given me so much.
The light of the Living Force drains from Tor Valum into
Kylo’s open hand.
KYLO (CONT'D)
Thank you.
"The ancient being falls dead, reduced to a withered shell."
EXT. BONADAN - OUTSIDE NAVIGATOR’S HUT - NIGHT
"Rey COLLAPSES, a powerful disturbance coursing through her."
POE
What is it?
REY
He’s growing stronger.
"Poe looks around the market, as if Kylo is nearby."
REY (CONT'D)
We don’t have much time.
INT. JEDI TEMPLE SPIRE - NIGHT
Sparks fly as Rose welds the broken conductor into place.
FINN
Will this old thing work with
modern droids?
ROSE
You’re asking me about the mechanics
of a Force-powered antenna.
FINN
Out of your realm of expertise?
ROSE
Out of anyone’s realm of expertise.
"She closes the panel, flips a rusted lever. Silence."
FINN
"So is there like an “on” button, or--"
THMMMM. A light IGNITES within the machine.
61.
ROSE
"Listen, if this goes sideways-- I"
just want to say--
FINN
Say what?
A column of light SHOOTS down the hollow spire.
INT. TEMPLE SPIRE BASE - NIGHT
C-3PO lurches as the ground VIBRATES. The column of light
from the spire above connects with the Kyber crystal below.
It GLOWS.
R2-D2 wheels next to the column of light and projects a
HOLOGRAM MESSAGE directly into the datastream.
EXT. CORUSCANT - NIGHT
"The light beam shoots up into the sky, visible for miles."
"The poor and downtrodden look up at the beacon, faces warmed"
"by its light. Among them, Dade smiles, hopeful."
EXT. DEEP SPACE
The LIGHT leaves Coruscant and connects to a nearby planet.
EXT. AGORA SIX - DAY
"Hills rise above a dense layer of palm jungle. Atop one, a"
THOUSAND-YEAR-OLD RECEIVER from the Old Republic. The light
"hits the receiver, disappearing within."
INT. AGORA SIX RECEIVER - DAY
An old copper machine consumes the light. The gears spin and
whirl. Monitors come to life with ARABESH CODE.
"An ancient BENDU MONK rises to his feet, looks to the sky."
He’s been waiting for this a long time.
Lights blink and flash as the machine decodes the datastream
"back into an image: LEIA, elegant in her white robes."
62.
EXT. AGORA SIX - SETTLEMENT - DAY
PEASANTS in a bread line look up at the light hitting the
receiver in the distance.
Suddenly a nearby R4 Unit droid beeps wildly and PROJECTS THE
HOLOGRAM OF LEIA.
LEIA
(hologram)
This is General Leia Organa of the
Resistance...
"The Receiver sends another BEAM OF LIGHT from its core,"
angled on a different trajectory into the sky.
EXT. DEEP SPACE
The beacon of light leaves the Agora system and connects to
"WAVETT, a light blue planet further into space."
EXT. WAVETT - SHIPYARD - DAY
WORKERS look up as the light hits a Receiver perched on a
cliff overlooking the ocean.
Suddenly every DROID in the yard simultaneously PROJECTS the
hologram message from Leia.
LEIA
(hologram)
The time has come to forge a path
to freedom.
INT. MON CALA - FISH BAR - DAY
MON CALAMARI pause to listen to the hologram emanating from
several droid servers inside the floating eatery.
LEIA
(hologram)
The forces of oppression have ruled
our galaxy for too long.
EXT. GRIA - DAY
A village of floating straw huts on water. The light hits a
man-made STONE TOWER on the horizon.
63.
LEIA
(hologram)
We must join together and fight.
Send your fastest ships...
EXT. BOTHAWUI CITY - DAY
Muscular canine BOTHANS look up.
LEIA
(hologram)
All your warriors...
INT. TRANDOSHA PALACE - NIGHT
"BOSSK, sitting like a sultan in his den of pleasures, turns"
angrily toward the hologram projected from his SERVANT DROID.
LEIA
(hologram)
Our voices will not be silenced.
Bossk looks out his window at the light connecting to a red
rock spire in the distance. He clenches his fist.
EXT. TATOOINE - MOISTURE FARM - DAY
Setting suns against a BOY and his SISTER at the base of a
vaporator tower watching their R6 unit play the hologram.
LEIA
(hologram)
We can no longer live in the shadow
of the First Order.
EXT. BONADAN MARKET - SUNSET
"Rey and Poe step through a dense, captivated crowd as droids"
project the end of the message.
LEIA
(hologram)
We must step into the light.
INT. ECLIPSE DESTROYER BRIDGE
"Leia stands on the bridge, watching the light connecting"
"planets. A familiar group of Resistance fighters join her,"
their eyes wide and hopeful.
64.
EXT. REMNICORE TUNDRA - NIGHT
"As he approaches his ship, Kylo Ren feels the light in the"
sky. It’s visible in the stars above.
"He moves to a rocky overlook. Closes his eyes, concentrates."
Holds out his hand.
The rocks around him VIBRATE. Deep.
The light in the sky HALTS. Stopped by an immoveable force.
EXT. SPACE
"The light is frozen in place like a suspended laser blast,"
thrumming as pressure builds.
INT. JEDI TEMPLE SPIRE - NIGHT
The beam grows in intensity. The receiver QUAKES.
ROSE
Something’s wrong.
FINN
Go. GO.
Rose and Finn dive away as the ancient device EXPLODES.
INT. ECLIPSE DESTROYER - BRIDGE
"The light GOES DARK, the fire of revolution extinguished."
Leia is overcome with an ominous feeling of loss.
EXT. BONADAN NIGHTMARKET - SUNSET
The holograms DISAPPEAR. Rey’s hope turns to alarm.
REY
We have to get to the ship.
POE
What is it?
"Rey is already moving, pushing through the crowd."
65.
INT. TEMPLE SPIRE - NIGHT
"Rose and Finn climb from the rubble, coughing on dust."
ROSE
You okay?
"They are suddenly SURROUNDED BY A TRIO OF TIE FIGHTERS, laser"
cannons aimed through the open arched windows.
FINN
Come on!
Finn clips onto the zip wire. Rose grabs on. They zip away
from the tower as the Temple Spire EXPLODES behind them.
"In the courtyard below, R2-D2 and C-3PO hurry out of the"
"collapsing temple, swallowed by a cloud of dust."
EXT. ABOVE CORUSCANT - NIGHT
"Finn and Rose escape the fireball, but the TIE Fighters turn"
"and PURSUE THEM, blasting away."
Rose draws her weapon and shoots at the enemy ships in
"midair. She shatters the front windshield of one, hitting the"
pilot. It spins out and CRASHES.
Rose is grazed by a laser blast. She screams in pain.
The zipline SNAPS as the temple spire CRUMBLES. Rose FALLS
INTO DARKNESS.
FINN
Rose!!
Finn swings into open floor of the unfinished skyscraper.
Struggles to unhook himself.
The TIE Fighters hover around the skeletal structure on
either side and FIRE INTO IT. Finn runs for his life as the
blasts ricochet off steel girders all around him.
He slides into a stairwell under heavy fire.
EXT. BONADAN NIGHTMARKET - SUNSET
"Rey crumbles, emotional, feeling Finn’s pain."
REY
Finn...
66.
"She looks up at Poe, the crushing feeling of loss growing"
heavier. But Poe is looking at something behind her.
"HATTASKA REN, through the separating crowd."
"OTT AND LORL REN on either side, menacing amidst the carnival"
lights and box lanterns.
"Rey rises, backing away from the oncoming Knights of Ren."
POE
Okay I’m with you. We gotta get to
the ship.
She reaches for her lightsaber...
POE (CONT'D)
Not here.
Rey eyes the children and peasants in the market. Poe’s
"right, they can’t take more casualties."
Rey clenches her fist and FORCE PUSHES EVERYTHING AROUND HER--
"a powerful concussion blast that knocks everything away,"
including Poe.
He flies off the edge of the market wall and plunges into the
water below.
"Rey jumps onto the dock, and unhooks a RAZORSAIL, powered by"
a Dyson-like air cannon.
REY
Get on!
Poe swims to the boat’s ladder.
POE
Can you sail?
Rey channels the Force and FILLS THE SAIL with a gust of wind
that launches them into the bay.
EXT. BONADAN BAY - SUNSET
Poe and Rey speed across the bay toward the landing array.
This boat is VERY FAST.
"Something fires from above, exploding the water all around."
Rey looks up.
Knife 9 SPEEDS OVER THE WATER TOWARD THEM.
67.
POE
Get to the bow cannon. I’ll drive.
Poe takes the helm while Rey activates the laser harpoon
mounted on the front.
She BLASTS AWAY at Knife 9 while Poe steers them toward the
Falcon’s docking array.
INT. KNIFE 9
"Hattaska Ren pilots with cold precision. Jaedec, Ott and Lorl"
sit in surrounding cockpit chairs.
EXT. BONADAN BAY - SUNSET
"The Razorsail now takes fire from all sides. Rey thinks fast,"
turns the harpoon and SHOOTS THE SAIL CORD.
She reaches out to Poe.
REY
Hold on!
Poe joins her and holds on tight.
The disconnected sail lifts them up like parasailers onto the
first revolving landing pad of the docking array.
The Razorsail hits the shore and EXPLODES.
"Knife 9 banks away from the explosion, but turns right"
around. They’re not done yet.
EXT. LANDING PLATFORM - SUNSET
Chewbacca is waiting by the ship.
POE
"Chewie, we drew some attention!"
An adjacent landing pad lowers into view.
Knife 9 rests on it. The four Knights of Ren stand ominously
"out front, their platform rising even with the Falcon’s."
Rey activates her lightsaber.
REY
Stand back.
68.
"Rey leaps onto their landing pad and takes them on, spinning"
"and striking fast, outmatched but relentless."
"Poe and Chewbacca unload their blasters at Jaedec, who"
deflects with skill while firing a pistol with one free hand.
Rey fights Hattaska--lightsaber vs darksaber--then FORCE
PUSHES him off the edge of the landing array. He falls fifty
feet to the next pad below.
"Ott and Lorl stay on her, moving in coordination, an unseen"
hive communication keeping their deadly attacks in sync.
Poe and Chewie can’t get a shot in on Jaedec--his blaster
"fires FAST, fully-automatic."
"Poe is GRAZED, he screams in pain."
ON REY AND THE KNIGHTS
"Rey hears Poe’s scream. It brings RAGE. She kicks Lorl away,"
buying a moment of one-on-one with Ott.
"She slices through him, dropping him cold. Then she spins on"
"Lorl, reaches out..."
"...and FORCE PULLS HIM INTO HER LIGHTSABER, impaling him."
"A ghostly screech as Hattaska RETURNS, swinging wildly."
Rey disconnects her double saber and BLOCKS HIS STRIKE--one
"saber blade still impaled in Lorl’s chest, the other clenched"
with Hattaska.
BENEATH THE FALCON
Chewbacca peppers Jaedec Ren with bowcaster fire. Jaedec
struggles to deflect the shots while Chewbacca advances.
"He reaches Jaedec, grabs him by the neck and HURLS him off"
the landing pad.
"Then he lifts his bowcaster and FIRES, hitting Jaedec in"
midair like a clay pigeon.
HATTASKA STRIKES AT REY
"Brutal swings, his darksaber sparking when it hits the"
concrete. He grazes her. She drops her lightsaber and falls
back. Unarmed.
69.
Hattaska stands over her. Raises his darksaber for the kill.
"When he does, Rey gets a good look at his MASK..."
FORCEBACK TO:
Dark figures in the rain. Voices SCREAMING.
"Lightning flashes, revealing HATTASKA REN."
BACK TO:
EXT. BONADAN DOCKING ARRAY - SUNSET
"This vision stirs a deep, vengeful ANGER in Rey. One she"
can’t yet explain but knows to be true.
Hattaska brings his saber down...but she extends her good
"hand, teeth clenched, eyes burning."
PURPLE FORCE LIGHTNING flows from her fingertips.
Hattaska Ren’s skull flashes within his helmet as the
electricity destroys him.
"The body falls, smoking."
"Rey rises. Poe and Chewbacca are watching her, disturbed."
REY
I- I had no choice.
POE
It’s okay. Jedi do that. Right?
REY
I’ve seen that mask before. All of
them.
Poe and Chewie head for the Falcon...but Rey does not follow.
POE
"Rey, let’s go."
REY
No. You can’t go where I’m going.
POE
What are you talking about? This
was the plan.
REY
The Resistance needs you. Finn and
Rose need you.
70.
POE
Rey. Get on the ship. Please.
REY
You have to leave this place.
POE
I’m not leaving you.
Rey knows what she has to do. Hates it.
REY
You will leave this place and go
back to help the Resistance.
POE
I’m not...don’t do this...
She approaches Poe. Delicately brushes her fingertips over
his bleeding forehead.
REY
You will leave this place and go
back to help the Resistance.
Chewbacca HOWLS.
POE
No...you can’t...
Poe feels his mind slipping away from him.
REY
You will leave this place and go
back to help the Resistance.
Rey takes Poe’s face in her hands and KISSES HIM.
"When she pulls away, Poe looks distraught. Saddened."
POE
I...I have to leave this place. I
have to help the Resistance.
Poe turns and walks up the ramp. Chewbacca follows. BB-8
"looks up at Rey, ever faithful. She’s purposefully cold."
REY
Go!
BB-8 BEEPS mournfully and follows them onboard.
"Rey watches as the Falcon’s ramp RISES, obscuring Poe and"
Chewbacca from her sight.
71.
"Strangely, as it closes, Poe holds up a hand goodbye. His"
sentience breaking through the mind trick.
"The Falcon rises into the sky, Rey’s sari robes whipping in"
the wind.
INT. KNIFE 9 - SUNSET
Rey enters the cockpit. Places Nomi’s hand-drawn map on the
console. Rests her lightsaber on top of it.
Her left hand is cut and bleeding. She wraps it with the sash
"from her sari, then removes the civilian robes to reveal the"
black warrior’s clothing beneath.
She catches her reflection in the mirror.
A Jedi.
EXT. BONADAN - LANDING ARRAY - SUNSET
Knife 9 rises into the air and rockets into space.
INT. TIE SILENCER - NIGHT
"Kylo Ren leaves Remnicore’s orbit, mask off."
A holocom transmission from Hux appears on his dash.
CHANCELLOR HUX
(holocom)
Supreme Leader. The Resistance
attempted to override the
communications blockade.
KYLO
Do you really not know who stopped
them?
Hux’s face betrays him. He didn’t know.
CHANCELLOR HUX
Such treachery cannot stand. We
must respond swiftly.
KYLO
Our Empire is strong. Show them.
72.
CHANCELLOR HUX
Your absence emboldens them. If
"you’ve acquired the power you seek,"
show it.
KYLO
"Snoke was right about you, Hux."
"Without faith, you serve only"
yourself.
Kylo shuts the holocom off. Sets new coordinates manually.
BLASTS INTO LIGHTSPEED.
INT. ECLIPSE DESTROYER - BRIDGE - SPACE
Leia looks out at the blue swirl of hyperspace.
CONNIX
(distant)
General...
"(clear, present)"
General? We’re approaching the
rendezvous point.
Leia makes a decision.
LEIA
Prepare an Imperial shuttle. I’ll
need a valid code clearance.
CONNIX
But we’re light years from--
(gets the look)
"Yes, General."
"Connix exits, leaving Leia alone. She removes the General’s"
"bars from her robes, pulls a hood over her head."
LUKE (VO)
He’s in pain.
She responds to Luke as if he speaks to her often.
LEIA
I feel it too.
"Luke’s Force Ghost steps forward, at her side."
LUKE
He’ll soon be more powerful than
our father.
73.
LEIA
So will she.
LUKE
She feels too much. Love. Anger.
LEIA
Don’t we all?
LUKE
This is why the Jedi live in
isolation. The pain of loss only
leads to the Dark Side.
LEIA
"I’ve lost everything, and everyone."
But I’d still choose to love.
Leia regards her brother. Missing him.
LEIA (CONT'D)
Trust her instincts. She may not
"follow the path of the Jedi, but"
she’s our only hope.
EXT. CORUSCANT - UNDERGROUND - NIGHT
"Finn sneaks out of the skyscraper, bleeding, disoriented."
"Voices echo, flashlights searching for him, bearings lost."
"Down the alley, Stormtroopers on AT-LT’s--single-rider"
walkers--scan the dark with flood lights.
A small light up ahead. He ducks into shadow.
"A Stormtrooper, RK-514, approaches, scanning the tunnel with"
his blaster-mounted flashlight.
"Finn appears behind him, shoves a handheld device in the back"
of his neck and STUNS HIM.
The Stormtrooper collapses. Finn confiscates his weapon and
holds him at blaster-point.
FINN
Look at me.
"The Stormtrooper moans, half-conscious."
FINN (CONT'D)
Take off your helmet.
74.
"The Trooper follows the order. His eyes are scared,"
disillusioned. Vulnerable.
FINN (CONT'D)
What do you remember? How far back?
RK-514
Huh?
FINN
Do you remember when you were
taken? Remember your parents?
RK-514
I. I don’t know.
FINN
Yeah you do. You remember
everything. Conditioning camp.
Blind fires.
RK-514
It was t-training.
FINN
That’s what they tell you.
Finn’s face finds the light. RK-514 recognizes him.
RK-514
You’re him. The traitor.
FINN
That’s right. We’re brothers. All
of us.
Finn tosses the Stormtrooper’s helmet out of reach.
FINN (CONT'D)
Give me your comm link.
RK-514 hands him his First Order comm.
FINN (CONT'D)
It’s not what they said it would
"be, is it? The things we’re ordered"
to do. It’s not right.
RK-514 takes that in. Torn. Breaking.
FINN (CONT'D)
You had a name once. Do you
remember it?
75.
He shakes his head no.
FINN (CONT'D)
Get a name. That’s the first step.
Finn shoulders RK-514’s blaster and kicks open a sewer grate.
RK-514
Then what?
FINN
Find something worth fighting for.
"Finn DROPS into the dark sewer, leaving RK-514 changed."
INT. FIRST ORDER CAPITOL - INQUISITION CHAMBER - DAY
Chancellor Hux stands over a prisoner strapped to a vertical
torture rack. Rose.
CHANCELLOR HUX
Are you comfortable?
ROSE
"Yeah, I have one of these at home."
CHANCELLOR HUX
You changed the stolen Destroyer’s
signature codes so we couldn’t
trace it. Give me the new codes.
ROSE
"You know, they told me to pick"
"something easy to remember, like"
Life Day but...
CHANCELLOR HUX
You think this is funny. Very well.
"Hux holds out his hand. Shuts his eyes, concentrating deep."
ROSE
Are you? Are you trying to use the
Force on me?
CHANCELLOR HUX
Be quiet.
ROSE
"Oh no, see...you’re not special. I"
"mean, at all."
76.
CHANCELLOR HUX
Shut up!
"He calms his fury, restraining himself."
CHANCELLOR HUX (CONT'D)
We have other ways to extract
information.
Hux opens a blast door to reveal an ELECTRIC TORTURE DEVICE.
"New tech, built to work quickly."
Rose braces for a more painful kind of defiance.
CUT TO:
EXT. OLLAFORN - DAWN
Leia’s shuttle descends among plumes of earth-hued steam
shooting up like skyscrapers from surface cracks.
"ALIENS soak in sulfur baths, sweating from the steam."
INT. OLLAFORN VILLAGE STREET - DAY
A trio of drunken FIRST ORDER OFFICERS stumble down a side
"street on leave. Two hold up the blitzed third, singing."
FIRST ORDER OFFICER
Sing it how my mother sang it!
A white-robed figure walks past them. We glimpse LEIA’S face
as she maneuvers through the enemy’s midst.
She eyes an unmarked door lit by a single lamp. When the
"coast is clear, she heads in."
INT. OLLFORN CABARET CLUB - DAY
"Classy, smoke-filled. Lampshades on every table. No customers"
"left, only ALIEN SERVERS cleaning up and cashing out."
A slovenly BAND MANAGER divides up credits between a pair of
quad-armed XEXTOS at the two pianos on stage.
The Servers leave their night’s take to be counted by the
"owner, LANDO CALRISSIAN, 70, smooth as ever."
Leia’s shadow falls over the pile of credits.
77.
LEIA
A man in his element.
"Lando looks up, smiles big."
LANDO
Leia.
"Lando is quickly on his feet, brings her hand to his lips."
LEIA
"Alright, alright."
The band manager eyes them from the stage.
LANDO
You shouldn’t be seen here.
LEIA
For your sake or mine?
LANDO
Both.
INT. OLLAFORN CABARET CLUB - PRIVATE LOUNGE - DAY
Lando pours a warm cup of tea.
LANDO
The clientele are mostly First
"Order, but what can I do? The grip"
of this Empire is tighter than the
last. Smuggling’s a matter of life
and death.
LEIA
I need your help.
LANDO
(wary)
Leia...
LEIA
We need ships. Pilots. You know
every smuggler in the galaxy--
LANDO
"Look, I promised Han I’d take care"
of you if something happened--
LEIA
Oh you’d take care of me?
78.
LANDO
"I know, you deserve better. But"
helping your new friends crash into
the First Order’s machine isn’t
what he would’ve wanted.
LEIA
"Lando, the galaxy needs you."
Lando eyes something of concern on the cabaret floor. A trio
of STORMTROOPERS talking to that skeezy Band Manager. They
look up in Lando’s direction.
He takes Leia’s hand and heads for a private elevator.
LANDO
Remind me never to make promises.
INT. OLLAFORN - DOCKING BAY - SPACE
Lando brings Leia to her shuttle ready for departure.
LANDO
You need to go. I can’t protect you
here.
LEIA
Come with me. Fight with us.
LANDO
"We won a war once already, what"
good did that do?
LEIA
We proved it could be done.
LANDO
Leia. I’d do anything for you.
Lando puts a loving hand on Leia’s cheek. Leans forward and
kisses her tenderly on the forehead.
LANDO (CONT'D)
I’m sorry.
IN THE SHUTTLE
"Leia watches Lando grow small as the shuttle flies away, his"
cape dusting behind him.
LEIA
Rey. Help us.
79.
EXT. DEEP SPACE - DAY
Rey drops out of lightspeed to find herself in swirling
"clouds, half red, half blue. An ominous and violent"
atmosphere surrounding a black circle.
The Galactic Void.
Suddenly the navigational equipment blinks out. The ship
rattles. Alarms sound.
"Rey braces herself, re-calculates for lightspeed and MAKES"
THE JUMP INTO THE VOID.
"The stars streak into infinite straight lines ahead, then"
TWIST AND BEND as she passes through the black hole.
"Rey’s face becomes a echo of itself, in fifteen places at"
"once, like the mirrorcave on Ahch-To."
NEARLY-SUBLIMINAL FLASHBACKS:
--Finn taking her hand on Jakku.
--Han Solo handing her a blaster on Takodana.
--Kylo reaching into her mind on Starkiller Base.
--Leia smiling fondly on her return to D’Quar.
--Luke taking the lightsaber on Ahch-To.
--Snoke snarling at her in the moments before his death.
--Poe yelling out her name on Bonadan.
--Hattaska Ren’s Force-electrified mask.
...until it all STOPS.
Rey opens her eyes. There is a planet ahead. No stars visible
"around it, only deep black."
Heavy clouds swirl over one third. Another third is a rich
green. Another orange and red.
Suddenly the power DROPS OUT. Lights on the dashboard go
dark. The ship goes into free fall.
EXT. MORTIS - WESTERN WOODS - DAY
Knife 9 skims over treetops and CRASH LANDS in a riverbed.
Tiny fish leap out of the water and run away.
80.
Rey pries herself out of the wreckage and sloshes to land.
She looks back at the smoking ship. No turning back.
"She hikes into the leafy forest, SUMMER TURNING TO FALL at an"
accelerated pace around her.
The trees clear to a steep ledge. A towering mountain ahead.
A TEMPLE barely visible at the summit. The valley below is
"alive with autumnal oranges, yellows and reds."
She journeys on.
EXT. MORTIS - EASTERN PLATEAU - DAY
Kylo’s Silencer lands in a clearing of dead trees. No leaves
"on the branches, covered in snow."
He looks up at the mountain ahead. Visibility is low.
A NATURAL STONE BRIDGE over a deep precipice. Tall granite on
"either side, vaguely shaped into primitive faces."
It feels like a gate.
"A WHISPER ON THE WIND swirls around him, fluttering his cape"
in the air. The Force is strong here.
He journeys on.
CUT TO:
EXT. CORUSCANT - IMPERIAL BOULEVARD - DAWN
Empty. Silent.
R2-D2 and C-3PO emerges from an abandoned building. Two small
figures swallowed by the desolate urban landscape. R2 BEEPS.
C-3PO
"I agree, R2. We may not survive"
this time.
A shadow falls over them both. A battalion of FIRST ORDER
TRANSPORTS descend through the morning mist.
"They touch down, releasing an army of BRUTETROOPERS."
"Thick, muscular mercenary enforcers, chrome armor and masks,"
reminiscent of Phasma. These guys make the Stormtroopers look
like the neighborhood watch.
81.
INT. TENEMENT BLOCK - DAWN
"The Brutetroopers bark orders, flashing lights and weapons as"
families are forced from their homes.
"A horrified, waist-high CHADRA-FAN begs for mercy."
CHADRA-FAN
Beeeeek! Beeeek naaat!
"A Brutetrooper shoves his rifle into the alien’s stomach,"
doubling him over. A trio of infants WAIL from their perch on
the ceiling.
"A few nearby Stormtroopers look at one another, disturbed by"
the violence. Next-level vicious.
The Brutetroopers push frightened citizens into prison
"crafts. Children are separated from their parents, herded"
into transports en route to the conditioning camps.
"They scream, reaching through steel bars as the crafts RISE."
R2-D2 and C-3PO watch in horror as it plays out around them.
C-3PO
I can’t watch. How horrible.
"R2 beeps, melancholy."
C-3PO (CONT'D)
We’ll never find Master Finn now.
INT. SEWER UNDERGROUND - DAY
Sludge water spurts out of multiple chutes into a gelatinous
"sewer cake of repulsive, mysterious contents."
"Finn JETS out of a chute and SPLASHES DOWN, sputtering."
FINN
Ughh.
A pack of SEWER WOMP RATS feed on the refuse encased in the
"gelatinous mass. One approaches and sniffs, hideous whiskers"
brushing his face.
Finn tries to dislodge his arms from the gel.
FINN (CONT'D)
Hey! Get away! Ugghgh!
82.
It takes a lick of his face before he can pull an arm out and
SWAT it away. The womp rats SCATTER.
Then he sees why the rats scattered.
"The colossal GRYOCK, a white eyeless larva the width of the"
"tunnel it’s emerging from. It feeds on the sewage, gaping"
mouth slowly sucking the gelatinous mass into its body.
FINN (CONT'D)
"Oh no. No, no no!"
Finn dislodges himself enough to get stuck again. The Gryock
"closes in, slow as the sludge he’s stuck in. This is the"
worst of bad nightmares.
"The Gryock’s jaws open, dripping saliva, teeth like knives..."
"Just as Finn is about to get eaten by this thing, a hatch"
"above him OPENS, pouring light."
It’s DADE.
DADE
Give me your hand!
Finn grabs the kid’s hand and pulls himself up into the hatch
just as the Gryock CHOMPS down.
INT. SEWER TUNNEL - DAY
"Finn collapses, shaking, traumatized for life."
FINN
That was. So many disgusting
things. All at once.
DADE
I’ve seen worse.
(offers a hand)
Dade.
FINN
Just one name?
DADE
"What’s wrong with that, Finn?"
FINN
You know me.
83.
DADE
We’ve been tracking you since you
landed.
FINN
We?
A distant SCREECHING sound.
FINN (CONT'D)
What was that?
DADE
You don’t want to find out. Come
on.
Dade shows Finn his RESISTANCE RING.
DADE (CONT'D)
Trust me.
EXT. UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - DAY
"Finn follows Dade down a tight tunnel, boots splashing in the"
shallow water. Light up ahead.
DADE
First Order purged a ten mile
radius around the Capitol after the
galaxy went dark. Took most able
bodies to the conditioning camps.
FINN
Did anyone escape?
DADE
Just us.
Dade opens a rusty door to reveal...
INT. ABANDONED UNDERGROUND PRISON - DAY
Hundreds of compartment-like dwelling units connected by
catwalks to a central control tower.
"Living here, a thousand escaped citizens, aged 12 to 60. Finn"
is stunned.
FINN
How many people are down here?
84.
DADE
Ten thousand. Maybe more.
FINN
You have weapons?
DADE
Whole city’s got weapons. That’s
what they’re afraid of. A million
"of us rise up, the First Order’s"
finished.
Finn lets that idea burrow deep.
FINN
You’re right.
"He’s caught up, fervent, brave."
FINN (CONT'D)
This revolution starts here. Right
now.
DADE
"Sure. All we need is ships,"
weapons. An army.
Finn looks out at the massive underground cavern of humanity.
A thousand faces. Waiting for a leader.
FINN
We have one.
Finn eyes the old prison Command Tower in the center.
INT. PRISON COMMAND TOWER - DAY
Finn kicks open the door and fires up the comm system. He
looks out at the downtrodden faces.
FINN
My name is Finn. I bring a message
from the Resistance.
"An OLDER WOMAN exits her cell. Tired and worn, kept down by"
this war since the Rebel Alliance days.
FINN (CONT'D)
The First Order rules by fear. They
build ships to intimidate us. Wear
masks to frighten us. But they’re
the ones who are scared.
85.
The Older Woman takes her wooden spoon and RAPS IT
rhythmically against the bars of the old prison.
FINN (CONT'D)
This is not the time to hide
underground. If we take the
"Capitol, the galaxy will join us!"
An ALIEN joins. Then another.
FINN (CONT'D)
Together we can strike back!
Together we can resist!
"Hundreds, then thousands of people CLANKING THEIR POSSESSIONS"
TOGETHER IN UNISON.
Finn stands tall. From traitor to deserter to revolutionary
leader--his journey has led to this.
EXT. MORTIS - WESTERN CLIFFS - DAY
"Rey scales the icy peak, blasted by wind and sleet. She"
"reaches a plateau, finds her footing."
There are statues of ROBED ANCIENTS here. Not Jedi.
A STORM OF SNOWDUST obscures her vision. Voices ECHO.
"Suddenly she’s back in the bright, warm sands of"
THE JAKKU DESERT
Wind sweeps over the dunes. A child’s voice screams out.
"Through the storm of sand, a little girl is dragged away from"
her MOTHER and FATHER.
It’s YOUNG REY at the moment her parents abandoned her. The
"little girl screams, reaching out her hand."
YOUNG REY
Come back! Wait!
"Rey steps toward them, feet digging in the sand."
REY
Wait...
The Mother breaks from the Father’s grasp and runs toward
"Young Rey, but the Father holds her back."
86.
FATHER
No! We can’t! It’s too dangerous!
The Mother relents. Calls to her daughter. Heartbroken.
MOTHER
Stay here! Wait for us! We’ll come
back. Understand? I promise we’ll
come back.
Young Rey SCREAMS.
"Rey’s watery eyes match her younger self as the ship rises,"
casting a shadow over them both.
"The sandstorm kicks up, obscuring them. It turns from yellow"
sand to SNOW.
"Rey catches her breath, devastated."
REY
They were afraid. Why were they
afraid?
No response. Only wind.
REY (CONT'D)
Luke! Tell me! Why were they
afraid?
He doesn’t answer. She grows furious. SCREAMS. Her lightsaber
flashes as she CUTS AN ANCIENT STATUE IN HALF.
"It falls, cracks in half."
"She looks up at the Temple above, anger burning in her eyes."
EXT. MORTIS - EASTERN FOREST - DAY
Kylo hikes through winter. Glimpses of the Temple break
through the canopy above.
Suddenly the wind dies. There’s something ahead.
A HOUSE IN THE WOODS. Smoke from the chimney.
"His younger self, BEN SOLO, approaches the house. He wears"
all black robes. A hood.
"This is clearly some kind of Force-induced vision, a sign of"
this planet’s strength.
Kylo watches from the shadows as Ben nears the house.
87.
"When he puts his hand on the iron door handle, it opens."
HAN SOLO stands in the doorway. He looks at his son with
sadness and fear.
HAN SOLO
"What are you doing, Ben?"
BEN
That’s not my name anymore.
HAN SOLO
You’re mother can’t see you here.
Not like that.
Ben pulls his hood down. He’s maybe seventeen.
BEN
I’m not coming back. There’s a
greater destiny for me.
HAN SOLO
"They’re lies, son. Empty promises."
You have everything you need right
here.
BEN
"What, you? Her? My Master says I"
have unequaled power. Neither of
you understand.
HAN SOLO
Your mother understands more than
anyone.
BEN
She sent me away.
HAN SOLO
To learn. To grow.
BEN
I have grown.
"Kylo watches Han approach his son, strikingly similar to"
their confrontation on the catwalk on Starkiller Base.
HAN SOLO
Your mother loves you.
BEN
She’s afraid of me.
Han eyes the lightsaber in Kylo’s hand.
88.
HAN SOLO
"Give me the lightsaber, son."
Han reaches for the lightsaber.
BEN
You know I can’t.
ON THE STARKILLER BASE CATWALK
Kylo is back in the moments just before he killed his father.
"He watches as he plunges the blade through Han Solo, his"
father’s eyes full of love even as the life drains from him.
IN THE MORTIS EASTERN FOREST
"Kylo, disturbed and shaken, alone again in the snow."
"Determined, he takes his first steps up the mountain."
CUT TO:
EXT. CORUSCANT STREETS - DAWN
Empty. Silent.
R2-D2 and C-3PO emerge from a side street. Two small figures
swallowed by the desolate urban landscape. R2 BEEPS.
C-3PO
I agree. This isn’t the Coruscant I
remember.
A shadow falls over them both.
A towering AT-MT WALKER rounds onto the boulevard. They watch
"it pass, dwarfed by it."
"It stops--a smoking, charred FIRST ORDER TANK in its path."
"C-3PO and R2-D2 look on, curious."
INT. AT-MT WALKER - COCKPIT - DAY
The AT-MT PILOTS look down at the burning tank.
AT-MT PILOT
Any life forms?
AT-MT COPILOT
Nope.
89.
INT. ABANDONED BUILDING - SIMULTANEOUS
Finn and a hundred PEOPLE’S RESISTANCE FIGHTERS hunker down
inside this empty building. The AT-MT’s head is positioned
just below them outside.
FINN
Now.
Floor-mounted GRAPPLING GUNS fire hooks that STICK into the
"opposite building, creating several ziplines over the AT-MT."
Finn clips on a carabiner...
EXT. CORUSCANT STREETS - DAY
Twenty Resistance fighters SWING ONTO THE AT-MT LIKE PIRATES
BOARDING A SHIP.
Finn drops onto the top of the AT-MT’s body. Dozens more land
beside him. They run along its back to the head.
A Resistance Fighter cuts through the hatch with a vibrasaw.
Finn tosses a shock detonator inside.
FINN
Clear!
An electric FLASH within. The Pilots slump over the controls.
"Finn drops in, pushes the Pilots aside, takes the helm."
"A familiar alien, SIX-EYES, takes the co-pilot seat."
FINN (CONT'D)
Load up!
"The side panels of the Walker slide open, allowing the"
Resistance fighters to rappel into the cavity.
More armed citizens pour out of the alleys to escort the
"steel beast as it WALKS DOWN THE BOULEVARD, knocking aside"
the flipped tank as it passes.
A pair of TIE CHOPPERS zip around the corner and square off
against the AT-MT.
The Walker BLASTS THEM OUT OF THE SKY.
90.
INT. CAPITOL - INQUISITION CHAMBER HALLWAY - NIGHT
"Hux paces. In the next room, Rose SCREAMS IN PAIN between"
electric jabs and shocks.
COMMANDER SELLIK
Chancellor. There’s been an
insurrection. Word has spread to
other districts.
CHANCELLOR HUX
Decimate them.
COMMANDER SELLIK
Sir...the leader is a former FN
unit. He was aided by a regiment of
our own.
Hux twitches.
CHANCELLOR HUX
Impossible.
COMMANDER SELLIK
We’re dispatching additional units
to address the revolt.
CHANCELLOR HUX
NO. No. Recall the FN units from
active duty.
COMMANDER SELLIK
Sir?
CHANCELLOR HUX
If there is a flaw in their
"programming, we must correct it."
Deploy more Brutetroopers.
COMMANDER SELLIK
Those mercenaries are
undisciplined. And expensive.
CHANCELLOR HUX
Perhaps money is all that inspires
loyalty anymore. Do it.
INT. CAPITOL - INTERROGATION CHAMBER - DAY
"Rose’s eyes are sunken, clothes ripped, blood peeking through"
"the torn fabric. She hears COMMOTION, the barking of orders."
"Two Officers enter, in a hurry."
91.
FIRST ORDER OFFICERS
Transfer to cell block 6. They want
her in maxiumum security.
"One officer releases her from the rack. She slumps forward,"
dead weight. They drag her toward the door.
"As they move, Rose opens her eyes, eyeing the electric taser"
on the Officer’s hilt.
When they reach the door she HITS THE LIGHTS.
"She grabs the taser, shocks them both. Clamps both their"
wrists to the iron shackles.
ROSE
"So long, boys."
"Rose shuts the door behind her, leaving the two unconscious"
Officers in here alone.
EXT. IMPERIAL BOULEVARD - DAY
The AT-MT turns the corner onto Imperial Boulevard.
"Inside, Finn stokes revolt via loudspeaker."
FINN
(into comm)
We will no longer live in silence!
Gather your weapons! Rise up!
Strike back!
Finn squints out the window at a GOLD DROID wandering among
"the cheering revolutionaries, unsure how he got here."
FINN (CONT'D)
Threepio?
Finn climbs out of the AT-MT hatch for a better look.
Suddenly he’s YANKED UPWARDS. A BRUTEROOPER lifts him out of
the hatch and THROWS HIM ONTO THE BACK OF THE WALKER.
"Finn is locked in a FISTFIGHT on the back of a moving Walker,"
50 feet off the ground.
Finn takes BRUTAL HITS from the Brutetrooper’s steel gloves--
it’s like fighting a medieval knight with his bare hands.
A powerful TACKLE and they BOTH ROLL OFF THE EDGE OF THE
MOVING WALKER...
92.
...SLAM! They land on the Brutetrooper’s back. He KEEPS
"FIGHTING, unharmed."
"Finn spots the Walker’s foot coming down on them, they ROLL"
AWAY just as it lands.
"The Brutetrooper grabs a fallen blaster, puts a heavy foot on"
"his chest, aims for Finn’s heart."
BRUTETROOPER
"Last words, FN-2187?"
Suddenly laser fire TAKES HIM OUT.
Finn looks up...at a UNIT OF STORMTROOPERS.
"The leader takes off his helmet, extends his hand."
It’s RK-514.
He lifts Finn to his feet. Hands him a blaster.
RK-514
Rafe.
FINN
I like it.
The other Stormtroopers take off their helmets and throw them
aside. Diverse faces with a new purpose.
Freedom.
INT. ECLIPSE DESTROYER BRIDGE - SPACE
Connix escorts Leia to a terminal.
CONNIX
The message is from an First Order
transmitter. Finn is alive.
He has an army ready to storm the
Capitol. They need reinforcements.
LEIA
All we have is what’s on this ship.
You can’t win a war with a hundred
pilots.
POE
Plus one.
Chewbacca GROWLS.
93.
POE (CONT'D)
"Sorry, plus two."
BB-8 beeps.
POE (CONT'D)
"Okay, I get it."
Leia’s face falls from relief to dread.
LEIA
Where’s Rey?
POE
"She went on alone. Her choice, not"
mine. What about the others?
LEIA
We lost contact with Rose.
(BB-8 beeps sadly)
Finn is alive. He says he has an
army on the ground.
POE
Then we put our pilots in the sky
and back him up.
(off her look)
What? This is what we’ve been
waiting for. If we take the
"Capitol, we can destroy that jammer"
and call the galaxy to war.
LEIA
They’ll kill millions. I’ve seen
it. It’s too reckless.
POE
Resistance is reckless! Passion is
the greatest weapon we have!
Poe appeals to Leia. Their history together laid bare.
POE (CONT'D)
The Rebels fought the Empire and
won. You showed us it could be
done. But that was your war. This
one’s ours. Let us fight it.
Leia looks out at the Resistance Fleet. Young. Ready.
LEIA
Set a course for Coruscant. Ready
all weapons and attack ships. This
is a full assault.
94.
INT. ECLIPSE DESTROYER - DOCKING BAY - SPACE
Resistance Soldiers load into transports. Pilots lower their

URBAN ASSAULT VEHICLES roll into the open cargo holds of
massive heavy transports.
EXT. ECLIPSE DESTROYER - SPACE
The Eclipse tacks toward a distant point. The hyperdrive
"FIRES, rocketing the massive craft deep into space."
CUT TO:
EXT. TEMPLE OF MORTIS - DAY
Kylo Ren ascends the steps to a sealed stone door.
The Temple is cut into the mountaintop. Uninterpretable
"carvings, runes and statues allude to civilization and"
knowledge long lost.
He reaches out. The door bends to his will and OPENS. A
millennium of dust spills from its cracks.
But he does not enter. He knows he’s not alone.
KYLO
I knew you’d come.
Kylo turns to face REY.
His mask surprises her. She’s only seen the projection of his
ideal self in their connections. Not this.
KYLO (CONT'D)
The Force is strong in this place.
Can you feel it?
A low RUMBLE. She’s digging into his mind.
REY
You’re in pain. Beneath that mask.
KYLO
Get out of my head. You won’t like
what you find.
"He FORCE-PUSHES HER BACK. Her feet slide back a few inches,"
"but she withstands it, steadfast."
95.
KYLO (CONT'D)
I’m stronger than Anakin Skywalker.
Stronger than his son.
REY
But you’re still afraid.
KYLO
Of what? You?
REY
Of what you’ve become. The Dark
Side has left you empty. Alone.
KYLO
I don’t have to be alone. With the
"power of this place, we could rule"
the galaxy as the Ancients did. The
Dark Side and the Light.
REY
You still think I’d join you. After
what you did to my family?
Kylo falters a bit.
REY (CONT'D)
We’re you going to tell me here?
Weaken me with the truth? I know
"what you did. Deep down, I’ve"
always known.
She circles him like a lion.
REY (CONT'D)
My parents didn’t sell me for
drinking money. They were hiding me
from you.
KYLO
So you remember.
FLASH TO
The Knights of Ren in the rain--the image from Rey’s Force
vision when she first touched the lightsaber.
A distant child SCREAMS.
KYLO (CONT'D)
Snoke made his orders clear. Find
anyone who could destroy him. It
didn’t take us long to find you.
96.
REY
You killed my parents.
KYLO
You blame me for your life on
Jakku. You should thank me for it.
You were safe.
REY
Say it! Did you kill them?
KYLO
I did.
"A blast of powerful energy EXPLODES AROUND HER, clearing the"
temple mount of loose rocks.
REY
You murdered Han Solo...
KYLO
"I’m not here for you, Rey."
REY
Millions of people...
KYLO
All I want is behind that door.
Rey IGNITES HER DUAL-LIGHTSABER.
REY
Then you’ll have to kill me.
Kylo lights his own saber.
KYLO
I know.
Kylo ATTACKS. They CLASH on the steps of the Temple. Both far
more powerful than the last time they met.
One of these two will not survive.

"X-WINGS and RAZORCRAFT FIGHTERS speed out of the bay,"

No! We don’t have enough pilots.
Get out there and do some damage.

INT. FIRST ORDER CAPITOL - COMMAND DECK - DAY
Hux enters the command deck overlooking the Boulevard. Smoke

COMMANDER SELLIK
"Chancellor, we’ve detected a ship"
in orbit. One of ours but with
unrecognized signature codes.
CHANCELLOR HUX
It’s the stolen Eclipse. Summon all
Destroyers to the Capitol. We can
end this uprising and eliminate the
Resistance in one triumphant day.
EXT. ECLIPSE DESTROYER - SPACE
The Millennium Falcon rockets out of the bay and joins the
"Resistance attack fleet. The Sentinels unleash hell, assisted"
by a squadron of TIE HUNTERS launching from within.
Poe is inundated with blasts from the larger ships. A trio of
Hunters bear down on the Falcon...then EXPLODE IN SUCCESSION.
98.
"CHEWBACCA’S X-WING zips overhead, eliminating the enemy ships"
"with precise, focused shots."

The Eclipse unloads a SUPERLASER on the Sentinels.
They EXPLODE as our attack fighters and transports descend
through the billowing fire to planetfall.
EXT. CORUSCANT - IMPERIAL BOULEVARD - DAY
WHOMP! The AT-MT Walker’s foot stomps down the boulevard
toward the First Order Capitol.
The new Resistance army moves with it. Thousands now. Some
"with blasters, others with nothing but clubs and passion."
Finn marches out front with Rafe and his Rebel Troopers.
"Dade rides out of the top hatch of the head of the AT-MT,"
speaking through the booming broadcast speaker.
DADE
Rise up! Join the fight!
Small bands of REVOLUTIONARIES appear from side alleys. A
"trickle building to a stream, building to a river..."
But a distant sound silences them. LOCKSTEPPED BOOTS.
A THOUSAND RIOT-SUPPRESSING MANDALORIAN BRUTETROOPERS. Bulky
armored mercenaries with heavy shields and arm cannons.
99.
"Sun cuts through the fog, revealing the extent of the"
Capitol’s defenses: ADVANCED TANKS and WALKERS. New designs
we’ve never seen.
Finn holds the line at the sight of the oncoming forces.
FINN
Stand your ground!
Finn and the Stormtroopers are HIT WITH FIRE FROM ALL SIDES.
ON R2-D2 AND C-3PO
Walking through lasers.
"A First Order Astromech Droid, R8-O8, rolls to a scomp"
terminal on the side of a flipped tank and plugs in.
R2 BEEPS urgently.
C-3PO
He’s sending a distress signal!
Stop him!
Nobody’s listening to C-3PO. R2 beeps furiously.
C-3PO (CONT'D)
Me? I’m not programmed for
"violence, R2."
"BEEEEEP! C-3PO steels himself, hustles through laser fire and"
rips open the back panel of R8-O8.
C-3PO (CONT'D)
I do apologize for this.
He reaches into the droid’s innards and PULLS circuits out.
"R8-08 BEEPS in distress, adding to C-3PO’s horror."
C-3PO (CONT'D)
Please go quietly.
"One last YANK and R8-08 sparks out. Tips, hits the ground."
R2 quickly plugs into the vacated scomp link. Sends his own
"command. The belly Rail Gun stops, spins, resets and FIRES ON"
THE BRUTETROOPERS.
"Finn climbs up onto the flipped tank, past C-3PO who frets"
over the inanimate shell of R8-O8.
100.
C-3PO (CONT'D)
I’ve done horrible things. I may
never be the same.
Shadows glide over the long boulevard.
A squadron of TIE BOMBERS CRATER the boulevard ahead of them.
Geysers of concrete spew upward. They’re about to be
decimated...
...when a fleet of X-Wings and B-Wings dive from the sky.
The Resistance ships FLY THROUGH THE TRENCH OF BUILDINGS and
"hammer the Bombers, spinning them into explosive collisions."
"Finn, Rafe and the Stormtroopers CHEER THE SKIES."
Resistance transports land on the boulevard behind them.
"Stolen First Order AT-ATs, AT-STs, and ATTACK SPEEDERS emerge"
"from the cargo doors. They are heavily modded, painted with"
"revolutionary colors, eyes and teeth."
Resistance Troops pour out of landing transports.
FINN
You feel that?
Finn swells with hope.
FINN (CONT'D)
We are the Resistance! All of us!
CUT TO:
EXT. TEMPLE OF MORTIS - NIGHT
"Rain pounds the grey stone, lit by flashes of blue and red."
Lightsabers CLASH as Rey and Kylo fight mercilessly on the
steps of the Temple. Ancient statues crumble--Rey stops them
"in midair, pushing them back."
KYLO
I could have been your teacher.
Rey loses ground. Doubts herself. Stumbles.
KYLO (CONT'D)
I could have ended your pain.
"Rey SLICES KYLO’S MASK, shearing the bottom right half clean"
"off, revealing the flesh beneath."
101.
He REMOVES IT. Eye to eye now. She parries and ATTACKS.
KYLO (CONT'D)
You’re weakening.
"Kylo allows Rey’s barrage to hammer him, taking careful,"
controlled counter strikes through her wild assaults.
KYLO (CONT'D)
The last glimmer of a dying light.
Kylo STRIKES--a wicked blow across her face that instantly
cauterizes a scar from her left cheek to her forehead.
Rey’s lightsaber drops to the stone.
"She falls to her knees and SCREAMS, CLUTCHING HER EYES."
"When she opens them, the world is an abstract blur of light."
She’s BLINDED.
"Kylo stands over her, lightsaber pointed to her heart."
Rey looks up. CRYING BLOOD.
Rey falls backwards down the stone steps. Motionless.
KYLO (CONT'D)
"Goodbye, scavenger."
"Kylo enters the Temple of Mortis, leaving Rey blind and"
bleeding on the steps.

Leia clenches her fist amidst cheers of victory.
WHOOMMM WHOOMMM WHOOMMMM. Ten more Destroyers arrive at once.
An armada of sizes and classes.
Her confidence drains.
LEIA
Come about!
The Eclipse TURNS ON ITS AXIS and UNLEASHES HELL. The lasers
light up the dark like Christmas.
"The First Order Destroyers fire back, faster and more"
propulsive than we’re used to--their relative scale to the
Eclipse lets us feel their SPEED for the first time.
EXT. CORUSCANT - AIR BATTLE - DAY
"The Resistance ships weave and glide between buildings,"
firing on TIE Hunters at window-level of the profiteers who
financed this conflict.
"A tight squadron reaches the Capitol itself. Their leader,"

Rose sneaks through the crisp white hallway. She ducks into a

COMMANDER SELLIK
Ready the hyperdrive.
Rose holds a gasp. The Capitol is a SHIP.
COMMANDER SELLIK (CONT'D)
In the unlikely event our defenses
are breached we’ll make the jump to
lightspeed.
She watches the First Order Techs break away. They scan the
ID bars on their uniforms and disappear through a door.
Rose sneaks to a window overlooking A VAST ARCHITECTONIC
ABYSS encircling the spine of the Capitol.
"Attached to the spine like a vertebra, the cubed TRANSMISSION"
JAMMER. Completely encased in armor with no bridges or access
points. She can’t reach it.
Removes those confiscated First Order ID bars from a hidden
pocket. Scans the door. It OPENS.
INT. FIRST ORDER CAPITOL - NAVIGATION ROOM - DAY
Rose creeps into a control room stacked with nav consoles.

Great! Listen carefully. I need R2
to transfer me the hyperdrive keys
before this thing takes off.
FINN (COMM)
Hyperdrive? Where are you?
107.
ROSE
There’s a scomp link terminal at
the base of the Capitol. I’ll have
a direct connection to him from
there. Got it?
EXT. MONUMENT SQUARE - DAY
Finn looks around frantically.
FINN
R2!! Where are you!
He spots C-3PO and R2-D2 behind a flipped tank. Races to
"them, grabs R2-D2."
FINN (CONT'D)
We need to get you to the Capitol.
C-3PO
"Master Finn, we’re more suited for"
rear unit duty.
"Finn looks out at the battlefield, eyeing the path to the"
base terminal. First Order transports touch down ahead. Even
more Brutetroopers spill out into the Square.
FINN
None of this matters if we don’t
reach that terminal.
"R2 BEEPS, determined."
C-3PO
"For glory? What are you saying, R2?"
There is no glory for droids!
BLAM! R2-D2 takes a direct hit from a cannon blast. He hits
the side of the tank and falls hard.
No comical squeal. He’s silent and scorched black. Unmoving.
C-3PO (CONT'D)
R2? R2!
FINN
Chewie cover us!
"Finn hunkers over R2. Chewbacca stands tall, firing away."
C-3PO
R2! R2 say something!
108.
Finn waves smoke away from R2’s burnt body. The droid’s
"circuits are dead, no power."
FINN
Those codes are in here somewhere.
Finn opens a panel and removes R2’s MEMORY DRIVE.
FINN (CONT'D)
"I’m sorry, buddy."
(yells)

"BB-8 rolls up, ready for duty. Finn opens a compartment in"
the droid’s round body and inserts R2’s memory drive.

It’s all up to you now. Okay?

"Rose, send BB-8 the terminal"
coordinates. He’s got this.
"(to BB-8, confident)"
You got this. Right?
BB-8 nods. Silent. Focused. His moment.
FINN (CONT'D)
Covering fire!
"Finn, Chewbacca and the Stormtroopers cover as best they can."
FINN (CONT'D)
Go! Go!
BB-8 DASHES INTO THE BATTLE.
"We stay right with him, tracking past a barrage of explosions"
"and laser blasts, through moving AT-MT legs, narrowly missing"
craters and fallen Brutetroopers.
"Finn watches the little guy from afar, inspired."
"He looks around at the wounded Resistance, cut off and"
"surrounded, fighting for survival."
BOOOMMM! An explosion knocks Finn off his feet. Ears ringing.
RAFE
Fall back!
"Finn yells to C-3PO, still kneeling over R2-D2’s fallen body."
FINN
Threepio! We have to move!
109.
C-3PO looks up. Hand on R2’s scorched head. Emotion like
we’ve never seen from him.
C-3PO
I can’t leave him.
Finn is speechless. Crushed by it all.
Chewbacca reaches down and HEAVES R2-D2’S SCORCHED SHELL UP
ONTO HIS BACK.
CHEWBACCA
RWWORRRRRRGHH!!!!
"With one arm blasting and the other securing R2, he and Finn"
race toward cover.
"Chewbacca gets hit, STUMBLES. Keeps going."
"Chewbacca is HIT AGAIN. Falls to one knee, almost drops R2."
Stands up.
Finn’s eyes tear up as they fire back at impossible odds.
This is how it ends.

Kylo Ren’s long shadow precedes him into the cavern of stone.
Statues of the ANCIENTS look down into a deep void in the

Kylo reaches out. The stone slab slides off and falls to the
ground with a THUD.
"He looks down into the well beneath the temple, deep into the"
"heart of Mortis, eager for his reward..."
It’s EMPTY. Nothing. A hole in the ground.
KYLO
No...no....
Kylo searches the rune-covered walls for answers. He finds
only arcane sculpted faces looking down at him.
"He fires his saber and SLASHES AT THE STATUES, scarring the"
Ancients with his rage.

LUKE SKYWALKER steps into the light. A thin blue glow traces

Luke looks deep into his former student’s pained eyes.
KYLO
I did what I had to do.
LUKE
You chose hate.
KYLO
I chose power!
Kylo FIRES his saber and ATTACKS. But Luke CATCHES THE BLADE
"WITH HIS GLOVED HAND, stopping it in midair, stronger than"
Kylo could possibly imagine.

CONNIX
First Order forces are in retreat!
Send more ships to the Capitol!
Leia smiles as relief washes over her.
LEIA
(into comm)
"Poe, get down there."
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - SPACE
Poe steers the Falcon into a steep descent straight down.
POE
Copy that.
The Falcon starts ONE LONG DESCENT FROM SPACE INTO THE CITY.
"Poe takes out TIE Hunters as he goes, firing the Falcon’s"
forward cannons until they JAM DRY.
"The ship dives into the canyon of buildings, leveling out on"
a trajectory toward the legion of AT-MTs on the Boulevard.
The Falcon BUZZES over the heads of Poe and Chewbacca...
116.
"...and CRASHES THROUGH THE LEGS OF THE WALKERS, cutting the"
"mechanical beasts off at the knees, toppling them all as it"
sparks out into Monument Square.
The ship grinds to a stop at the base of the Capitol. The
accumulated pile of fallen walkers and crashed ships creates
a BARRICADE ON THE FRONT STEPS.
INT. FIRST ORDER CAPITOL - DAY
Alarms blare. Commanding Officers frantically prepare for
departure. Hux eyes the crashed Falcon in the square below.
CHANCELLOR HUX
Bomb the city! Decimate every last
being!
COMMANDER SELLIK
"Our forces are outnumbered, sir."
Hux realizes the tragic truth. He lost the star wars.
INT. CHANCELLOR HUX’S CHAMBER - DAY
Hux storms into his lush chamber.
Goes to the collector’s case. Removes one of his prized
vintage lightsabers.
He activates it and IMPALES HIMSELF WITH THE PURPLE BLADE.
"Hux kneels, the glowing saber protruding from his chest as"
First Order ships descend in smoke and fire out the window.
CUT TO:
INT. TEMPLE OF MORTIS - NIGHT
"Kylo counters Rey’s every move. They are evenly matched, two"
"sides of a coin, flame and shadow. Fighting to the death."
A vicious swing and Kylo’s lightsaber SHATTERS at the hilt.
"DESTROYED, along with several fingers on his left hand, cut"
across the palm.
"He looks at it with disbelief, stumbles back toward the empty"
Well of Mortis. Falls to one knee.
Rey stands over him. Anger flowing.
117.
She separates her dual-lightsaber. Holds one blade pointed to
Kylo’s chest.
Kylo is stunned by powerful being before him. She’s almost
glowing. Unfathomable LIVING FORCE within.
Kylo clenches his teeth...eyes furious...
A rage like we haven’t seen since Anakin...
He reaches out the open palm of his good hand...
....and EXTRACTS THE LIVING FORCE FROM REY as Tor Valum
taught him.
"She RISES, energy flowing from her body into Kylo’s hand as"
the life DRAINS FROM HER.
She pulls her blindfold off and SCREAMS TO THE SKY.
Kylo stands tall. Energized. His face has RETURNED TO NORMAL.
Healed. He pulls the iron plates off his skin--they fall
"away, healthy flesh underneath."
He looks beyond Rey to the empty Well of Mortis.
KYLO
The were wrong. All of them. The
power of this place can’t be taken.
REY
Ben...
KYLO
But it’s nothing compared to you.
Kylo TAKES MORE FROM HER.
Rey is almost gone. Drained of life. She summons all her
strength. Reaches out.
"With the last of herself, she OFFERS HIM HER HAND."
REY
Ben...please...
INT. ECLIPSE DESTROYER BRIDGE - SPACE
Leia feels the disturbance. It PAINS her. Into the vastness
"of space, she says her son’s name."
LEIA
Ben...
118.
INT. TEMPLE OF MORTIS - NIGHT
"Then Kylo hears HIS MOTHER’S VOICE, carried by the Force."
LEIA (VO)
Ben.
He STOPS. Hearing her. Feeling her close.
LEIA (VO) (CONT'D)
Come back. Come home.
Something HAPPENS to Kylo when he hears his mother’s voice.
INT. ECLIPSE DESTROYER BRIDGE - SPACE
Leia speaks to her son through the Force.
LEIA
Help us.
INT. TEMPLE OF MORTIS - NIGHT
Kylo feels the very thing that destroyed Anakin. But doesn’t
make him feel weak.
He looks at Rey’s outstretched hand...and TAKES IT.
THE LIVING FORCE FLOWS BACK INTO HER.
Both light and dark swirl within Rey as Kylo is reduced to an
empty shell. A man without power. A frightened boy.
"Kylo and Rey collapse into one another, each propping the"
other up on their knees.
Rey is close to him now. Their foreheads touching.
"He is weakened, spent. In the last moments of his life."
KYLO
Solana.
"Rey is stunned to hear her name. Distant, like a memory."
KYLO (CONT'D)
Your name.
(last breath)
Rey Solana.
Those words are Ben Solo’s last.
119.
Rey watches the light dim in his eyes. But it is the light.
REY
Goodbye Ben.
"With a look that could be perceived as love, BEN SOLO DIES."
Rey releases her hold. Collapses. Barely alive herself.
They’ve fought to the death.
EXT. CAPITOL STEPS - SUNSET
"Finn appears through smoke. Blood-stained, dirty. A hero."
Rafe and the other renegade Stormtroopers behind him.
Poe climbs out of the Falcon cockpit. Chewbacca helps him.
"Finn regards his old friend, amazed at his transformation."
He spots a fallen RESISTANCE FLAG on the ground. Picks it up.
Hands it to Finn.
"Finn takes the flag, climbs up the angled bow of the crashed"
Midnight Oiler to the top of the barricade of ships.
Poe and Chewbacca scale it with him.
Finn WAVES THE FLAG FOR ALL TO SEE.
The ground SHAKES. They all look up as the First Order
Capitol leaves its moorings.
POE
Everybody get back!
A thunderous BOOM as the Capitol RISES INTO THE SKY.
FINN
Rose is still in there!
Finn spots BB-8 rolling toward them from the quaking base.
FINN (CONT'D)
BB-8! Where is she?
INT. FIRST ORDER CAPITOL - ESCAPE POD BAYS - DAY
Rose races through the quaking Capitol. Checks a hand-drawn
"map on her hand, rounds a corner toward a bay of ESCAPE PODS."
"Climbs inside one, shuts the door."
120.
It LAUNCHES as the Capitol RISES. A short trip before it
CRASH LANDS onto the battlefield.
INT. FIRST ORDER CAPITOL - COMMAND DECK - DAY
Commander Sellik looks down at the shrinking metropolis
below. The massive structure casts a shadow over the city.
SELLIK
Ready for lightspeed.
EXT. FIRST ORDER CAPITOL - DAY
Finn rushes to Rose’s crashed escape pod.
FINN
Rose!
(touches her face)
Are you okay?
"Touches his hand, affectionately."
ROSE
I’m fine.
"She looks up at the rising Capitol, backlit against the"
"setting sun. Poe, Chewie, BB-8 and C-3PO follow her eyes."
C-3PO
They’re getting away!
FINN
Did you disable the hyperdrive?
ROSE
I couldn’t figure it out.
Hope falls away. The war is lost.
ROSE (CONT'D)
So I made some adjustments to their
navacomputer. Without precise
calculations that thing could--
The Capitol JUMPS TO LIGHTSPEED. The moment it vanishes:
BOOOOMMMMMMMMM!!!!!
"It COLLIDES WITH A DISTANT PLANET. The impact is so massive,"
"so galaxy-shaking, it’s visible for light years."
121.
ROSE (CONT'D)
...fly right into a star.
INT. ECLIPSE DESTROYER - SPACE
Leia shields her eyes at the enormous EXPLOSION in deep
"space, pulsating in the starry twilight."
A beacon of hope.
Radio communications instantly CRACKLE TO LIFE.
"A CACOPHONY OF VOICES fill the frequency waves, calling on"
their brethren to fight.
EXT. MONUMENT SQUARE - DAY
"Finn, Poe, Rose, Chewie and the droids all look up. Awed,"
inspired. But they can’t celebrate. Not yet.
He looks at Finn. Speaking volumes.
FINN
You feel it too.
"Poe nods, affirming their connection. Rey is gone."
INT. TEMPLE OF MORTIS - NIGHT
Rey lies flat on the stone.
Silence.
"Light fills the space around her, particles of energy"
floating up. She RISES with them...
The light engulfs the frame until we reach a place beyond
what we know.
THE ASTRAL PLANE
Glimmers of energy flicker like fireflies in darkness.
Rey opens her eyes. Clear again. Unburdened.
Three of the distant glimmers grow larger than the others.
She moves toward them.
"YODA, LUKE SKYWALKER and OBI-WAN KENOBI."
122.
REY
Is this death?
OBI-WAN
"In this place, there is no such"
thing as death.
REY
I can see.
OBI-WAN
Your true self is free of
suffering. Free of pain.
YODA
"Taught us much, you have."
REY
I’ve taught you?
YODA
Mmm. Succeeded where we have failed.
Narrow was our point of view.
LUKE
You chose to embrace the Dark Side
and the Light. To find balance
within.
YODA
"Co-exist, they must, as such"
feelings do in all of us.
REY
But if I’m here...with you...
YODA
"A choice, you must make. To return,"
or to remain.
LUKE
"Here, there is serenity. Knowledge."
"Peace. Those lost, but not forgotten."
She looks beyond them at the shimmering flecks of energy.
REY
And there?
OBI-WAN
There you will face a galaxy in
"turmoil. Pain, suffering. The loss"
of those you love.
123.
YODA
But living you will be.
"Love, you shall."
We hold on Rey’s face as she considers the life she’s yet to
live...and makes her decision.
REY
Thank you.
The spirits fade into the cosmic Force. As the light
"overwhelms us, Obi-Wan Kenobi’s voice echoes..."
OBI-WAN (VO)
"You are a Jedi, Rey Solana. But you"
will not be the last.
EXT. CORUSCANT - DAY
A Resistance Flag rises from the rubble at the site of the
old Capitol. Thousands of citizens fill the square. Free.
INT. CEREMONIAL HALL - DAY
Heroes at attention. LEIA SKYWALKER ORGANA in elegant white.
Lando Calrissian and her top Generals around her.
"Finn, Rose, Poe and Chewie stand before Leia. She places"
Medals of Honor around each of their necks. BB-8 beeps
excitedly at their feet.
"After 40 years of service, Chewie gets a medal."
EXT. LANDING PLATFORMS - SUNSET
Leia looks down at the blue beacon bracelet once used to
"guide Rey back to safety, clenched tight in her hand."
Finn and Rose stand by her side.
LEIA
I can’t feel her presence.
Finn bows his head. Neither can he.
LEIA (CONT'D)
But there’s a calm I’ve never felt.
Balance.
FINN
That’s her.
124.
"Leia smiles. BB-8 rolls up, beeps to Rose and Finn."
ROSE
Come on. We have work to do.
"Leia approaches Poe and Chewbacca, also on their way. She"
places the beacon bracelet in Poe’s hand.
POE
I’ll never stop looking.
Chewbacca gives her a giant Wookiee hug.
LEIA
"Okay, okay. Easy."
"Finn approaches Poe, holding something under his arm."
FINN
Let me know what you find.
POE
I will.
Finn hands Poe his old leather jacket.
FINN
For good luck.
Poe smiles. Takes it. Hugs him. Chewbacca GROWLS.
"We follow Poe and Chewie to the MILLENNIUM FALCON, rebuilt to"
look better than it has in decades.
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - SPACE
Poe flips switches in the cockpit.
POE
"Ready, Chewie?"
"He takes Rey’s beacon and hangs it, replacing Han’s dice."
INT. LEIA’S QUARTERS - NIGHT
Leia watches from her window as the Millennium Falcon jets
off into the starfield.
The Phantom Hawk rockets the other way into empty space.
"Leia checks on R2-D2, still under construction. A REPAIR"
DROID works on rebuilding his destroyed frame.
125.
LEIA
How’s he coming along?
C-3PO
A quick cycle through his memory
banks and he’ll be his old self
again. I hope.
LEIA
"He’ll be fine, 3-PO."
C-3PO
I can’t imagine what I’d do without
"him. I know he’s stubborn but I, I--"
LEIA
I know.
"Leia picks up R2-D2’s intact memory drive, rescued by BB-8."
"She inserts it into R2-D2, reminiscent of the first time we"
saw the Princess with a droid.
R2 BEEPS TO LIFE.
"As his files catalogue into chronological order, he projects"
the contents of his memory banks...
"....and we witness their adventures over 60 years, all from"
the droid’s perspective.
--Luke buying C-3PO from the Jawas...
--Obi Wan giving Luke his father’s lightsaber...
--R2 flying through the Death Star trench...
--Han getting his medal on Yavin...
--Yoda lifting the X-Wing from the swamp...
--Luke saluting from the plank on Jabba’s barge...
--Leia and Han outside the bunker on Endor...
Leia is taken aback by the flood of memories. It is a
"catharsis for her, and for us."
She takes a deep breath.
LEIA (CONT'D)
"Thank you, R2."
Leia leaves them alone together.
R2-D2 BEEPS affectionately.
126.
EXT. LEIA’S BALCONY - NIGHT
"Leia steps outside, looks up at the field of stars."
He looks up at the vastness of space.
A star falls. It gives her peace.
EXT. MODESTA - DAY
"A serene, sun-dappled ranch surrounded by rolling green"
fields of tall grass. Smoke curls from the chimney.
INT. HOMESTEAD - DAY
"Finn sits with a circle of YOUNG KIDS, 6-11 in a sun-drenched"
cabin. A fire crackles as he finishes a story.
FINN
...and the light could be seen all
over the galaxy. In every system.
Rey gave us all hope.
"A LITTLE GIRL, 7, looks confused."
LITTLE GIRL
But how do you know she’s really
gone?
FINN
I don’t think she is gone. I
believe...
"Finn eyes Rose, seated at a wood table, parts of a droid’s"
motivator spread out in front of her. She smiles.
FINN (CONT'D)
I believe someday she’ll come back.
"And when she does, we’ll be here"
waiting. All of us.
"The kids smile, relieved. They like that ending."
FINN (CONT'D)
Go on. Get outside.
The kids leap up and run out into daylight. Finn rises with
them and follows the last one out.
127.
EXT. MODESTA - DAY
The children race about the pasture. Dade is among them. So
is the BROOM BOY from Canto Bight.
"They race around a NERF FOAL, trying to hook a ring around"
"its tiny horns. BB-8 races with them, beeping excitedly."
The little girl HOOKS IT. The ring flies back through the air
into her hand.
These children are FORCE SENSITIVE.
Finn and Rose have built a refuge for Force-sensitive youth
to live the life they never had.
"Finn steps onto the front porch, leans against a post. The"
twin sunset washes his face.
Something in that sunset changes his wistful expression.
"Unclear at first, but it soon becomes a realization."
A tremor in the Force...
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DEEP SPACE
Poe and Chewie in the Falcon at lightspeed.
The beacon hanging from the dash suddenly begins to GLOW.
"Chewie ROARS. Poe sees it, eyes wide."
POE
"Chewie, turn the ship around."
CHEWBACCA
RWWWOOORRRWWGGGHH!!!!
POE
"I know, just turn around!"
EXT. MODESTA - DAY
Finn notices a GLIMMER OF LIGHT in the distance. He steps
"forward to get a closer look. Rose joins him, shielding her"
eyes from the sun.
"A figure blurs on the horizon. A familiar silhouette. Dirty,"
ragged. Walking for a long time.
"BB-8 rolls forward, beeps excitedly. The kids hear the droid,"
"stop their game, look to the fields beyond."
128.
ON THE HORIZON
Rey Solana.
"Her eyes are restored, only a faint scar runs across her"
forehead.
"The kids run toward her, joined by BB-8, who is faster."
Rey walks on toward the homestead.
Here she will train a new generation of Jedi and pass down
what she has learned--that only an understanding of the
balance within can lead to peace and justice in the galaxy.
THE END
1. EXT PLAIN OF HOTH – HELICOPTER SHOT – DAY
A white snowscape races toward camera… the MAIN TITLE quickly
"recedes, followed by a roll-up."
Episode V: THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK… After the destruction of
"its most feared battle station, the Empire has declared martial law"
throughout the galaxy.
A thousand worlds have felt the oppressive hand of the Emperor as
He attempts to crush the growing rebellion.
"As the Imperial grip of tyranny tightens, Princess Leia and the small"
band of freedom fighters search for a more secure base of
operations…
The roll-up disappears into the bleak horizon. 2. EXT PLAIN OF
HOTH – HELICOPTER SHOT – DAY
The camera tilts down bringing into view a small figure galloping
across the windswept ice slope. 3. EXT PLAIN OF HOTH – DAY
A closer panning shot reveals a bundled rider on a large gray snow
"lizard, called a TAUNTAUN. Curving plumes of snow rise from"
beneath the speeding paws of the two-legged beast. 4. EXT PLAIN
OF HOTH – SLOPE – DAY
The rider gallops up a slope and reins his lizard to a stop. 5. EXT
PLAINS OF HOTH – SLOPE – DAY
He pulls off his protective goggles. It is LUKE SKYWALKER. He
notices something in the sky and takes a pair of electro-binoculars
from his utility belt. 6. EXT PLAIN OF HOTH – LUKE’S POV – DAY
"From LUKE’S POV, we follow a bright object as it falls to the ground."
"On the distant horizon, an explosion marks the point of impact. 7."
EXT PLAIN OF HOTH – SLOPE – DAY
The wind whips at Luke’s fur-lined cap as he activates a com-link
transmitter. His lizard is nervous.
"LUKE (to the Tauntaun) Easy girl, it’s just another meteorite. (into"
"com-link) Han… Han ol’ buddy, do you read me?"
After a little static a familiar voice is heard.
"HAN (OS) (filtered) Loud and clear, kid. What’s up?"
LUKE I’ve finished my circle and I haven’t picked up any life readings.
HAN (OS) (filtered) There isn’t enough life on this ice cube to fill a
space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I’m heading back to the
base.
LUKE I’ll see you shortly. A meteorite just hit the ground near here
and I want to check it out… Won’t be long. 8. EXT PLAIN OF HOTH –
SLOPE – DAY
"Luke clicks off his transmitter and reins back on his lizard, which"
seems frightened. Luke pats the beast on the head to calm
"it. LUKE Weeho, girl! What’s the matter… you smell something?"
There’s nothing out there. I’ll check again…
Luke takes a small device from his belt and starts to adjust it when
"suddenly a large shadow falls over him from behind, followed by a"
monstrous HOWL. Luke turns and looks up at an eleven foot high
shape towering over him.
LUKE Son of a jumping…!!!
"He grabs for his pistol, but is HIT flat in the face by a huge, white"
"claw, knocking him into the snow, bloody and unconscious. 9."
CLOSE-UP LUKE
Luke falls unconscious into the snow. The terrified screams of the
Tauntaun are cut short by the horrible snap of a neck being
broken. 10. EXT PLAIN OF HOTH – SLOPE – DAY
The WAMPA ICE MONSTER grabs Luke by one ankle and drags him
away. 11. EXT METEORITE CRATER – SNOW PLAIN – DAY
A WEIRD MECHANICAL SOUND is heard over the whining of the
"wind. A strange PROBE ROBOT, with several extended sensors,"
emerges from the smoke-shrouded crater. The ominous robot
"FLOATS across the snow plain, and disappears into the distance. 12."
EXT ICE CAVES – REBEL BASE ENTRANCE – DAY
A stalwart figure rides his Tauntaun up to the entrance of an
enormous ice cave. 13. INT MAIN HANGAR DECK – REBEL BASE
Rebel troopers are rushing about unloading supplies and otherwise
securing their new base. The rider swings rakishly off his lizard and
pulls away his goggles: HAN SOLO. He walks briskly into the
"main hangar deck toward the MILLENNIUM FALCON, which is"
"parked among several fighters. Mechanics, R-2 units and various"
other droids hurry about. Han stops at the Millennium Falcon. His
Wookiee co-pilot is welding on the back of a central lifter. Now he
stops work and lifts his face shield; CHEWIE growls a greeting to his
boss.
"HAN Cold isn’t the word for it, Chewie. I’ll take a good fight any day"
over all this hidin’ and freezin’!… How you coming with those lifters?
The Wookiee GRUMBLES a reply.
HAN All right. I’ll go report then I’ll give you a hand with them. Soon
"as those lifters are fixed, we’re out of here."
Chewbacca lets out with a joyful CHUCKLE and returns to his work
as Han leaves. 14. INT COMMAND CENTER – ICE CAVE
A makeshift command center has been set up in a blaster area of
"thick ice. The low-ceilinged room is a beehive of activity. Controllers,"
"troopers, and droids move about setting up electronic equipment and"
monitoring radar signals. GENERAL RIEEKAN straightens up from a
console as Han approaches.
RIEEKAN Captain Solo. What’s the situation?
HAN There isn’t a hint of life in the area. But all the perimeter markers
"are set, so you’ll know if anyone comes calling."
"RIEEKAN Good, and Commander Skywalker?"
HAN He’s checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He’ll be in
soon. RIEEKAN (indicates radar screen) With all the meteor activity
"in this system, it’s going to be difficult to spot approaching ships."
HAN The Empire won’t look for you out here. I’d say you’re all set…
which means it’s time for me to get going.
LEIA (OS) You’re leaving?
"The two men turn to see PRINCESS LEIA, dressed in a short white"
combat jacket and pants. She is upset by Han’s news. Her hair is
braided and tied across her head in a “30′s” Nordic fashion…
HAN That’s right.
RIEEKAN You’re an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you.
"HAN Thank you, General. But there’s a price on my head. If I don’t"
"pay off Jabba the Hutt, I’m a walking dead man."
RIEEKAN I understand. A death mark is not an easy thing to live
"with… Until our paths cross again, may the force be with you."
Rieekan touches Han and moves away. Han turns to Leia.
"HAN (with feeling) I guess this is it, Your Highness."
Leia is angry. Han sees she has no warmth to offer him. He shakes
his head and adopts a cooler tone.
"HAN Well, don’t get all mushy on me. So long, Princess. Han walks"
"away. Leia stews a moment, then follows him. 15. INT ICE"
CORRIDOR – REBEL BASE – HOTH
"Han strides down a corridor carved from the ice. Leia follows quickly,"
"agitated. Behind them, unnoticed, an appendage of a Wampa Ice"
Monster suddenly detaches from a seemingly solid section of ice wall.
LEIA Han!
Han stops in the quiet corridor and turns to face Leia.
"HAN Yes, Your Highness?"
LEIA You said you were going to stay. What happened?
HAN That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my
mind.
LEIA Does Luke know?
HAN He’ll know when he gets back… Don’t give me that look. Every
day more bounty hunters are searching for me. If I don’t pay off
"Jabba soon, there’ll be too many to stop… Remotes, Gank killers,"
and who knows what else. I’ve got to get that price off my head while
I still have a head.
"LEIA Han, we need you here."
HAN We?
LEIA Yes.
HAN Not you? LEIA (mystified) Me? I don’t know what you mean.
"HAN (shakes his head, fed-up) You probably don’t. How could you?"
You’re so terrified of your own emotions…
"LEIA And what are they, pray tell?"
HAN You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
"LEIA I respect you. You’re a bold fighter, maybe not the brightest,"
but…
"HAN No, your worship.. That’s not what I’m talking about."
"Leia stares at him, understands, then laughs."
LEIA You’re imagining things.
Han has had it with this broad. He steps closer. Leia is almost against
the wall. Han puts a hand against the wall to cut off any retreat.
HAN Am I? I say you came running after me because you were afraid
I was leaving you without even a kiss.
LEIA I’d just as soon kiss a wookiee. HAN There’s no accounting for
"taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss. (warming to the"
subject) You’ve spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders
"you’ve never learned how to be a woman. It’s a shame, because"
you’ve got all the makings for one. I could have helped you plenty in
that department… if you’d have let go for a minute. But it’s too late
"now, sweetheart. Your big opportunity is flying out of here. LEIA We"
are fighting for a cause much…
HAN Spare me please! Don’t tell me about the Rebellion again. I’ve
had it with your noble mission. All you let yourself think about is the
Rebellion. The result is you’re as cold as this planet.
LEIA And you think you’re the one to apply some heat?
HAN Sure… If I were interested. But I don’t think it’d be much fun.
"He steps away from her, takes a last cool appraisal."
HAN (Continued) We’ll meet again. Maybe you’ll have grown up a
little by then.
"LEIA You have all the breeding of a Bantha, but not as much class…"
"Enjoy your trip, hot shot!"
Leia walks away. 16. EXT ICE PLAIN OF HOTH – DAY
"Track with the sinister, probe robot as it moves across the vast frozen"
wilderness. One of its extended sensors detects something and the
"robot stops, turns and heads off in another direction, at high"
speed. 17. EXT MOUND OF SNOW – ICE PLAIN – HOTH – DAY
The robot stops before a large mound of snow about twenty feet long
"and six feet high. It circles the mound, then shoots a thin laser bolt at"
the snow drift. 18. CLOSE-UP MOUND OF SNOW
"The mound shakes a little bit and two large eyes appear at one end,"
staring directly at the robot. A primeval BELLOW issues forth from the
mound. 19. EXT MOUND OF SNOW – ICE PLAIN – HOTH – DAY
"The robot backs off a few feet, then blasts the mound with a heavy"
laser bolt that disintegrates the snow-covered creature in a cloud of
smoke and flame. 20. EXT ICE PLAIN – HOTH – DAY
The evil robot moves off toward the horizon. 21. EXT ICE GORGE –
HOTH – DUSK
The jagged face of a huge ice wall sits gloomily in the dim twilight of a
"Hoth day. Luke hangs spreadeagle upside down, ankles tied by hide"
"thongs to ice stalactites, his extended arms within a meter of the"
snow floor. His face is covered in dried frozen blood on one side. He
opens his eyes as a chilling MOAN of the hideous ice creature
echoes off the gorge walls. 22. EXT ICE GORGE – MED SHOT
LUKE – DUSK
"Luke pulls himself up, grabs hold of his ankles, and futilely tries to"
"unfasten the thongs. Exhausted, he drops back into the hanging"
position.
LUKE (to himself) Relax. Relax.
Luke spies his laser sword lying near a pile of his discarded gear
"about three feet out of reach. Reverberating through the gorge, the"
growling and crunching sounds of the approaching ice monster can
"be heard. Luke desperately strains for his sword. Quietly, almost a"
"whisper, Luke hears old BEN’S CALM VOICE."
"BEN (Voice Over) Luke, think the saber in your hand. Luke focuses"
on the saber as the huge monster’s feet crunch closer. Luke’s hand
"strains toward the weapon, his eyes squeeze tight in concentration."
"LUKE Gotta relax, relax…"
"BEN (Voice Over) Let The Force flow, Luke."
"Just as the ice monster looms over Luke, the light saber suddenly"
jumps three feet into Luke’s hand. The young warrior instantly ignites
"the sword, swings up and cuts both of his bindings. He drops to the"
"snow in a heap. The startled ice monster moves back, his giant"
yellow eyes blinking. The most that can be discerned of the creature
"is a shape, and those two perplexed eyes. Luke scrambles to his feet."
He swings his light saber and the monster screams in pain. 23. EXT
ENTRANCE TO ICE GORGE – HOTH – DUSK
Luke staggers out of the gorge and stumbles down a snow bank. 24.
INT MAIN HANGAR DECK – MILLENNIUM FALCON – DUSK
The hangar is full of activity. We hear a familiar stream of beeps and
"whistles a moment before catching sight of ARTOO and THREEPIO,"
who appear from a corridor and move along an ice wall toward the
"Millennium Falcon. Behind them, in the ice, two large yellow eyes"
blink open.
"THREEPIO It is not my fault, you malfunctioning twerp. I merely"
commented that it was freezing in her chamber. But it’s supposed to
be freezing. I did not ask you to turn on the thermal heater. I don’t
know how we’ll get all her things dried out… Ah. Here we are.
The two robots stop at Han Solo’s space freighter. Han and Chewie
"are still struggling with their central lifters. THREEPIO Captain Solo,"
sir. Might I have a word with you?
HAN What is it?
THREEPIO Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the
"communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is"
"malfunctioning… if it’s damaged, Artoo, could fix it, if you like."
HAN I shut it off. What’s her royal holiness want?
"THREEPIO She is looking for Master Luke, and assumed he would"
be here with you. No one seems to know…
Han glances at the fading light at the entrance of the ice cave as
night slowly begins to fall on the planet.
HAN (concerned) Luke’s not back yet? It’s almost night out there!
Han jumps down off the lift.
"HAN Bolt it down, Chewie… (yelling) Deck Sergeant! (into comlink)"
"Control, has Commander Skywalker reported in yet?"
He gets a negative reply as the DECK SERGEANT and an AIDE rush
up to Han.
DECK SERGEANT Yes sir!
"HAN Sergeant, is Commander Skywalker back yet? DECK"
SERGEANT I haven’t seen him. He probably came in through the
south entrance.
"HAN Probably isn’t good enough, Sergeant. Check on it!"
The Deck Sergeant and his aide turn and rush off. Artoo lets out a
confused whistle.
"THREEPIO I don’t know, Artoo. (to Han) Sir, might I inquire what’s"
going on?
HAN Go tell your precious Princess… Luke is dead unless he shows
up soon.
Artoo lets out with a hysterical whistle.
THREEPIO Oh no! 25. INT MAIN HANGAR DECK – TAUNTAUN
CORRAL – NEAR ENTRANCE – DUSK
The Deck Sergeant and several Troopers inspect the mangled
remains of three dead Tauntauns. Some of the hardware nearby has
also been brutally pulled out of shape. Several surviving Tauntauns
shuffle nervously nearby. Outside the light is slowly fading.
"TROOPER (to Deck Sergeant) … I can’t imagine, sir. Their necks are"
broken.
"The Deck Sergeant nods, then notices Han running up and steps out"
of the group to meet him.
DECK SERGEANT Commander Skywalker hasn’t come through the
"south entrance, sir. Maybe he slipped by without checking"
in. HAN Not likely! Where are the speeders?
DECK SERGEANT We haven’t got them adapted to this cold yet…
HAN We’ll have to go out on Tauntauns.
DECK SERGEANT The temperature is dropping too fast.
HAN You bet it is… and Luke’s out in it.
Han pushes through the troops and mounts a snow lizard. Huge
monster feet move into the shadows of one of the X wing bays.
DECK SERGEANT The night storms will start before you can reach
the first marker.
HAN Then I’ll see you in Hell. 26. EXT SNOW CAVE ENTRANCE –
"REBEL BASE – DUSK The small, lone figure riding a snow lizard"
races off into the hostile vastness of snow and cold. The slightest hint
of wind blows up the snow behind the Tauntaun. 27. EXT PLAIN OF
HOTH – DUSK
"The dark, evil probe robot moves across the frozen floor of the Hoth"
"plain. The wind is beginning to pick up, and snow starts to cake on"
"the front of the robot. It stops, hovers, then drops to the ground."
Several probes emerge from its metal hull and a dome shaped force
"field around the robot begins to glow. Eventually, the force field"
becomes a solid shape and is quickly covered with the blowing
snow. 28. EXT PLAIN OF HOTH – DUSK
Han rides across the plain on his Tauntaun. 29. EXT PLAIN OF
HOTH – CLOSE-UP HAN – DUSK
"He reigns his mount to a stop, looks around and listens. It’s almost as"
"if he hears something. He turns and looks in one direction, then spurs"
his lizard in that direction. 30. EXT PLAIN OF HOTH – DUSK
Han rides off across the plain on his Tauntaun. 31. EXT SNOW
DRIFT – HOTH – DUSK
"The wind is blowing quite strong now. Luke struggles to stay upright,"
"but a blast of freezing snow knocks him over. He struggles to get up,"
but can’t. The young warrior from Tatooine drags himself a couple of
feet and then collapses.
LUKE I can’t…
"BEN You must. Luke, look at me!"
Luke looks up and sees old BEN KENOBI standing not ten feet away.
Luke strains to lift himself up. He is speechless.
"BEN You must survive, Luke."
LUKE I’m cold… so cold…
BEN You must go to the Dagobah System… There you will learn
"from one who taught me: Yoda, the Jedi Master."
LUKE (reaches out weakly) Ben… Ben…
"BEN Luke… you are the only hope. The image of Ben fades,"
revealing a lone rider on a Tauntaun in the windswept horizon.
LUKE Ben!?
Luke drops into unconsciousness. 32. EXT SNOW DRIFT – HOTH –
DUSK
"Han pulls up, leaps off his lizard. He goes to his snow-covered friend"
"and cradles him in his arms. Han’s Tauntaun lets out a low, pitiful"
bellow. There is real fear in Han’s face as he shakes Luke.
"HAN Come on, buddy, you aren’t dead yet. Give me a sign here."
Luke doesn’t respond. Han begins frantically rubbing Luke’s wounded
face. Soon he is slapping him.
"HAN Don’t do this, Luke, it’s not your time…"
Luke responds to a slap. Han is joyous.
HAN All right! I knew you wouldn’t leave me out here all alone!
Han glances over toward his Tauntaun with concern as he starts to lift
Luke.
HAN (to Luke) We’ve got to get you out of here before our
transportation freezes. 33. EXT SNOW DRIFT BY TAUNTAUN –
HOTH – DUSK
Han has carried Luke almost to the lizard when the Tauntaun dies
with a moan. Han checks the lizard.
HAN Blast! Deader than a Triton moon. We haven’t got much
time. Han ignites Luke’s light saber and cuts the beast from head to
toe. He quickly shovels the steaming innards of the beast into the
snow. Then he lifts Luke’s inert form and stuffs him inside the
carcass.
"HAN I know this doesn’t smell so good, Luke, but it’ll keep you from"
freezing. I’m sure this Tauntaun wouldn’t hesitate if it were the other
way around. (Han gets an awful whiff of the insides) Whew! It’s just
"as well you’re out, pal."
Han starts pulling things out of a pack on the dead lizard’s back.
"HAN (into com-link) Base one, do you copy?… This com-link is"
useless.
The wind has picked up considerably and Han is beginning to find it
"difficult to move. He struggles with the shelter container, opens it and"
starts constructing it.
"HAN If I don’t get this shelter up fast, Jabba the Hutt won’t need"
those bounty hunters. 34. SNOW DRIFT – HOTH – DUSK
A veil of icy snow flows across the snow drift obscuring the doomed
warriors. 35. INT MAIN HANGAR DECK – ENTRANCE – NIGHT
Princess Leia and her two robots stand before the dark entrance to
"the rebel base, waiting for a sign of the two rebel heroes. Leia shivers"
as the cold wind blows in on her. Artoo beeps a mournful tone.
Chewie is sitting nearby with his head in his hands.
"THREEPIO Artoo can pick up no signals, although he feels his range"
is probably too limited to give up hope. Leia nods an
"acknowledgement, but she is lost in thought that is only broken when"
General Rieekan approaches.
RIEEKAN Nothing more can be done tonight. The shield doors must
be closed. I can’t wait any longer. I’m sorry.
LEIA (resigned) I understand.
"Chewie lets out a long, mournful howl, somewhat like a coyote."
RIEEKAN The speeders should be ready in the morning. They’ll
make the search easier.
LEIA Is there any chance of them surviving out there?
"RIEEKAN Slim, but yes, there’s a chance. They have a shelter. It’s"
"not much, but…"
Artoo lets out with a complex series of efficient beeps.
"THREEPIO Beggin’ your pardon, ma’am, but Artoo says the chances"
"of survival are one thousand, seven hundred twenty-seven to one. (to"
"Artoo) Actually, I don’t think we needed to know that."
Leia stands praying to herself as the huge metal doors slam across
the entrance of the ice cave. The loud BOOMS echo through the
huge cavern. Chewie lets out another howl. 36. EXT ICE PLAIN –
HOTH – DAWN
The huge dim sun of Hoth crawls lazily over the horizon in the North
as a spurt of snow shoots skyward revealing the dark probe robot.
"The sinister object pulls in several of its extended arms, hovers for a"
"few moments, then starts off across the bleak Hoth plain. 37. EXT"

FTC 2321 by TRX 1173. I’m closing in… 39. EXT ARMORED

"ZEV This is S-122 calling Captain Solo, Commander Skywalker. Do"
you copy? This is S-122…
There is a sharp crackle of static then a faint voice.
HAN (OS) (filtered) Nice of you guys to drop by. Hope we didn’t get
you up too early.
"ZEV (switching transmitters) Base One, I found them, Repeat, I found"
them… 41. EXT SNOWDRIFT – HOTH – DAY
The small shelter is covered with snow on the windward side. Han
has made a makeshift antenna which rests gingerly on top of the
snowdrift. The small armored speeder can be seen approaching in
the distance as Han waves frantically in the foreground. 42. INT

Strange ROBOT SURGEONS adjust a mass of electronic equipment.
A switch is thrown and a sudden blinding flash obscures Luke in a
"chamber filled with a thick, gelatinous red slime. Luke begins to"
"thrash about, raving in his delirium. 43. INT MEDICAL CENTER"
OBSERVATION ROOM – REBEL BASE
"Leia, Threepio, and Chewbacca are watching from a glassed-off"
"room next door, where Han is resting on a cushioned medical table."
They can hear the mechanical surgeons working and Luke’s ravings
on a speaker in the room.
LUKE Watch out… snow creatures… dangerous… Yoda… go to
Yoda… only hope… must survive…
"Han raises himself on the table, listening to Luke. Chewbacca makes"
"him lie back down, then BARKS a comment in reference to Luke."
"HAN He doesn’t make sense to me either, Chewie."
THREEPIO I do hope he’s all there… if you take my meaning. I would
hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit…
"HAN The kid ran into something mean, and it wasn’t the cold."
LEIA Those creatures he keeps talking about… we’d better double
"the security… Han, I don’t know how…"
HAN Forget it.
"TOO-ONEBEE (2-1B), a surgeon droid, enters the room."
"TOO-ONEBEE He had gone into dormo-shock, almost hibernation."
But he’s responding to the Bacta. We’ll bring him through. Leia
breathes a sigh of relief. Chewie lets out a long GRUNT of approval.
LEIA Now all we’ve got to worry about is what attacked him.
"HAN No kidding. If this snowball’s got nasty natives, they could be"
anywhere.
"Chewie WHINES, looks around."
"HAN That’s right, Chewie, inside the base. 44. INT CORRIDOR –"
REBEL BASE
"The drip, drip, drip of melting ice echoes throughout the long eerie"
"corridor. A trooper walks by, followed at a short distance by Artoo,"
"who rolls along whistling to himself. Behind him, a Wampa Ice"
Monster suddenly appears from out of the wall and begins following
the little droid. Up ahead Artoo sees several troopers begin to act
"rather strangely, pointing at him and yelling. This puzzles Artoo, and"
"he stops for a moment to figure it out. Far in the distance, alarms"
begin to go off.
"Artoo comes to a conclusion, spins his head around and sees the Ice"
Monster staring down at him. The droid lets out a screech and races
down the hall at full tilt ahead of the advancing monster.
A small troop of soldiers has gathered at the end of the hallway with
weapons. Artoo races through the armed gathering as the creature
"screams and charges the troopers, laser bolts exploding around him."
Artoo peeks from around a corner in time to see several troopers
hurled against the walls like rag dolls. Two soldiers fire a laser
bazooka at the monster and it is obscured by an enormous explosion.
The smoke clears. The silence is spooky. The Ice Monster stands
"seemingly dumbstruck. Artoo gives a short, worried beep. The"
creature topples over in a dead heap. A cheer goes up from Artoo
and the troopers as they converge to inspect the fallen creature. A
young CORPORAL pulls his com-link off his belt and speaks into
"it. CORPORAL We got it, sir, but there may be more. 45. INT"

Alarms buzz softly in the background. The entire command center is
on full alert. General Rieekan is conferring with the HEAD
CONTROLLER as Han and Leia enter the room. Threepio and
Chewie follow.
LEIA Have they analyzed the one that was killed?
RIEEKAN Not yet. They’re working on it now.
Another alarm goes off at a console behind them and the SENSOR
CONTROLLER at that spot calls across the room.
SENSOR CONTROLLER General!
Rieekan leaves the group as they continue…
HEAD CONTROLLER It won’t be long before our sensors will be able
to track them.
THREEPIO It figures Artoo would be in the middle of this.

they’re coming form. 46. INT COMMAND CENTER BY CONSOLE –

The group hurries over to Rieekan. RIEEKAN We’ve picked up
"something outside the base in zone one, moving East."
LEIA What is it?
SENSOR CONTROLLER Can’t tell yet… Metal.
HAN Then it’s not one of those creatures.
LEIA Could it be one of ours? A speeder?
"SENSOR CONTROLLER I’m getting no signal. Wait, something very"
weak.
Threepio steps up to the control panel and listens to the strange
signal intensely.
"THREEPIO I must say, sir, I’m fluent in over six million forms of"
"communication, but this is something new… must be in code or…"
A new VOICE comes over the com-link.
TROOPER VOICE This is station five and we have your object on our
"scopes… It’s just over the ridge, we should have visual contact in"
about… What the?… Oh no!
The transmission ends in static.
"HAN Whatever it is, it isn’t friendly. I’m going to have a look. Come"
"on, Chewie."

"OZZEL Are you sure, Captain?"
"PIETT Well, the report we have is only a fragment, from a probe droid"
"in the Hoth System, but it’s the best lead we’ve had"
in… OZZEL (angry) We have millions of probe droids searching the
"galaxy… I want proof, not leads. I don’t intend to continue to chase"
around from one side…

"PIETT Yes, Sir… we have visuals… the System is supposed to be"
devoid of human forms…
"On a large screen, an image of the rebel snow base appears"
surrounded by complicated computer readouts. The rebel speeders
can be seen approaching in the distance. Vader studies the image.
VADER That’s it. That’s the one.
"OZZEL My Lord, how do you know it’s them? There are so many"
uncharted settlements. It could be smugglers…
VADER I know. And I know young Skywalker is with them. Bring in
"the patrol ships, Admiral, and set your course for the Hoth System."
General Veers prepare your men… 56. INT ICE CORRIDOR –

Artoo and Threepio are moving by a steel door on which an X had
been painted. From behind it come intermittent THUMPS and
ROARS.
THREEPIO … It seems the snow creatures are attracted to a highpitched
whistle. That’s how they’re being drawn to this trap.
Artoo WHISTLES his understanding as he stands before the door.
Immediately the THUMPING on the door picks up. Artoo beeps a
"question. THREEPIO See your whistles upset them. No, I told you"
they can’t get out! Now will you hurry up? I don’t know why I bother…
Threepio moves around a corner. Artoo stares at the door another
"moment, then proceeds to tell the Ice Monsters off in a burst of beeps"
and whistles. The THUMPING picks up as Artoo moves casually
away. 57. INT MEDICAL CENTER – REBEL BASE
"Luke is out of the chamber, lying on the bed previously occupied by"
Han. Leia is at his side. She brushes the hair out of his eyes and runs
her fingers along the scar on his face.
LEIA The Bacta are growing well. The scars should be gone in a day
or so. Does it still hurt?
LUKE I’m fine. Really. Leia… when I was out there and it looked
"pretty bad… well, it made me think about things."
LEIA Me too. I was afraid.
Their eyes meet. Luke touches her cheek with his hand.
LUKE I don’t really know how to say this… I never have before…
"Leia, you know how I feel about you…"
She does and it’s confusing. Their lips are very close. About to kiss.
The door opens noisily and Threepio enters with Artoo. Leia pulls
"back, startled. Luke realizes the moment has been lost. His mind"
races for a way to regain it as Leia takes on her more formal manner.
The droids are a bothersome distraction; Luke’s concentration is on
Leia. Artoo beeps a cheerful greeting.
"THREEPIO Master Luke, it’s so good to see you functional"
"again. LUKE Thanks, Threepio. Leia…"
Artoo beeps and whistles.
THREEPIO Artoo expresses his relief also.
"LUKE Good. Thanks, Artoo."
LEIA (about to leave) You rest now.
THREEPIO So much has happened during the period of your
"indisposition, sir."
LEIA I’ll be back later.
LUKE (anxious to keep her) Leia… What would you think if I went
away for a while?
LEIA What did you say?!
Leia’s reaction is so much bigger and more vociferous than Luke
"expected, it starts what is to become a growing snowball of confusion"
for him.
LEIA Where are you going?
"LUKE I have this… feeling. I’m not sure, really…"
LEIA That’s just great. Why doesn’t everyone just take off?
LUKE What are you talking about?
"LEIA First Han, now you. When am I going to learn not to count on"
anyone but myself?… LUKE Han’s leaving?
LEIA … I was getting along just fine before I met you two moon
jockeys.
"LUKE Calm down, will ya? Tell me about Han."
LEIA He wants to pay off that criminal he’s in hock to.
LUKE Jabba the Hutt?
LEIA (back to her tirade) I could get more loyalty if I went down the
hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.
LUKE Snow creatures… they’re here?!
"THREEPIO Yes, sir. But they’re being trapped quite cleverly."
Artoo beeps and whistles proudly.
"THREEPIO (to Artoo) What do you mean, you took care of that? I"
would hardly call your part in that matter great…
Luke’s head is spinning as Han and Chewie make a vigorous
entrance. The Wookiee GROWLS a greeting.
"HAN Hi kid, you look strong enough to wrestle a Gundark."
LUKE Thanks to you.
"HAN That’s two you owe me, junior. Han turns to Leia with a big,"
devilish grin.
"HAN Well, your worship, it looks like you arranged to keep me close"
by for a while longer.
LEIA I had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan thinks it’s
dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we know where that
probe came from.
LUKE Probe? What probe?
HAN That makes a good story. But I think you just can’t bear to let
me out of your sight.
"LEIA I don’t know where you get your delusions, laser brains."
Chewie is amused; he LAUGHS in his manner. Han is enjoying this.
He regards Chewie good-humoredly.
"HAN Laugh it up, fuzz ball. You didn’t see her alone with me in the"
south passage.
Luke sparks to this; he looks at Leia.
LEIA (to Luke) I don’t know what he’s talking about.
HAN Ooops! I guess you haven’t told Luke about that yet.
LUKE About what?
"HAN Now don’t get the wrong idea, pal. She was just trying to"
express her true feelings for me. LEIA (to Han) You must have gone
completely out of your feeble mind.
"HAN Come on, your highness, are you telling me you haven’t been"
thinking about that kiss?
"Leia is flushed, eyes darting between Luke And Han."
"LEIA Why you low-down, stuck-up, half-witted, scruffy-looking nerfherder."
"HAN Who’s scruffy-looking? (a big grin) I tell ya’ sweetheart, I"
must’ve hit pretty close to the mark to get you hoppin’ like this.
"Doesn’t it look that way to you, Luke?"
LUKE (staring at Leia) Yeah… it does… kind of.
"Leia looks vulnerable for a moment, then the mask again, focusing on"
Luke.
"LEIA Oh it does, does it? Well, I guess you don’t understand"
"everything about women yet… do you, sonny?"
With that Leia leans over and kisses Luke on the lips. Then she
stands and walks out. Everyone is dumbstruck. The door closes
behind Leia and they all look at each other in silence.

"enters the room and approaches Vader. Vader doesn’t move. Veers,"
"although seemingly very sure of himself, is still not bold enough to"
interrupt the meditating Lord. The young general stands quietly at
attention until the evil presence speaks.
"VADER What is it, Veers?"
"VEERS My Lord, the fleet has moved out of light speed. Com-Scan"
has detected an energy field protecting an area on the sixth planet in
the Hoth System. The field is strong enough to deflect any
bombardment.
VADER (angry) The rebel scum is alerted to our presence. I told
Admiral Ozzel not to go out of light speed so close to the system.
VEERS He felt surprise was a wiser…
VADER He’s as clumsy as he is stupid. A clean bombardment is
impossible with that energy shield up. Prepare your troops for a
surface attack.
Veers turns smartly and leaves as Vader activates a large viewscreen
showing the bridge of the mighty space cruiser. Admiral Ozzel
"appears, with Captain Piett in the background."
"OZZEL Lord Vader, the fleet has moved out of light…"
VADER Captain Piett!
"The Captain steps forward, as the Admiral moves away slightly"
"confused, touching his throat as it begins to constrict. PIETT Yes, My"
Lord.
VADER Make ready to land General Veers’ assault troops on the

he dies. 60. INT MAIN HANGAR DECK – REBEL BASE

"Leia passes, giving Han a dirty look. A mechanism on the pirate’s"

"Artoo lets out a short beep, then steps forward, loses his balance and"
disappears with a splash into the water.
LUKE Artoo! 272. EXT SWAMP – DUSK
Luke dives in near the spot where Artoo fell. He surfaces and scans
the water frantically until he sees a small periscope pop up. The
"periscope turns until it gets a fix on Luke, then lets out a bubbling"
"beep, and starts through the water toward the muddy beach. Luke"
follows. 273. EXT SWAMP – DUSK
We see the POINT OF VIEW of an underwater swimming “thing” as it
watches R-2 and his young master struggling toward shore. R-2 is
powered by two bubbling jets. 274. EXT SWAMP – DUSK
"A dark, ominously finned back breaks the surface. Luke stops"
swimming for a second and sees the disturbing shape swimming
"toward him. Luke swims for his life, racing past Artoo and finally"
scrambling up on shore.
"LUKE Hurry, Artoo! 275. EXT SWAMP – DUSK"
"The thing swims up behind the little droid and dives, creating a loud"
clunk. Artoo’s periscope disappears as he lets out a pathetic
electronic scream. Luke wades a few feet into the murky pool looking
for any sign of his little friend. The black surface is as still as death
"itself… a few bubbles begin to appear, then PHHEEWAATT! The"
"runt-sized robot is spit out of the water, makes a graceful arc and"
"comes crashing down in a patch of moss. LUKE Artoo, are you okay?"
Artoo responds with a series of feeble whistles and tones.
"LUKE If you said you thought coming here was a bad idea, I’m"
beginning to agree with you. 276. EXT SWAMP – BEACH – DUSK
Luke is shivering cold as the fog begins to close in. He helps little
Artoo upright and starts to clean him off. All is quiet except for an
eerie and inhuman cry every once in awhile in the distance. Both the
robot and the boy glance around at the spooky swamp-jungle that
"surrounds them. Sinister shadows move among the trees, as Luke"
"notices a tiny, but vicious pair of eyes wink out and disappear in a"
scutter of feet.
"LUKE I’m sorry Artoo, I can’t explain the urge that made me come"
here. It was part of a dream… or… maybe I’m just going crazy. 277.
EXT SWAMP – POV – DUSK
Luke looks back at the slowly sinking spacecraft. 278. EXT SWAMP –
BEACH – DUSK
Artoo bubbles electronic profanity and ejects a stream of muddy
water from one of the ports in his head.
LUKE How are we going to get that thing flying again? What am I
doing here?
"Artoo beeps a short, “Got me boss.” 279. EXT IMPERIAL FLEET –"

Before him are the hologram images of twenty Battleship
"Commanders. One of these images, the Commander of the ship just"
"exploded, is fading quickly away at this moment. Another image, in"
"the center and a little apart from the others, is faded and continually"
disrupted by static. It is the Captain Needa of the Star Destroyer
which was most hotly on the tail of the Millennium Falcon. Admiral
Piett and an aide stand behind the Dark Lord.
CAPTAIN NEEDA (IN HOLOGRAM) … which was the last time they
appeared in any of our scopes. Considering the amount of damage
"we’ve sustained, they must have been destroyed…"
"VADER They’re alive, Captain. I know it and I want every ship"
available to sweep the asteroid field until they’re found.
The Imperial Star Captains fade off one by one as Vader turns to
Admiral Piett.
"VADER Now what’s so important it couldn’t wait, Admiral? Speak up!"
The Admiral is scared white as a sheet. He’s shaking.
ADMIRAL It was… the Emperor…
VADER The Emperor?
"ADMIRAL Yes, he commands you make contact with him…"
VADER Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position
where we can send a clear transmission.
"ADMIRAL Yes, My Lord. VADER And code the signal to my private"
chamber. 281. EST MILLENNIUM FALCON – ASTEROID CAVE

"dark, the exact dimensions are impossible to determine. 282. INT"
COCKPIT – MILLENNIUM FALCON – CAVE
Han and Chewie are busy shutting down the engine and the
electronic systems. Threepio and Leia watch worriedly as all the
service lights go out. Han glances from the dimming lights to Leia
with a quick grin.
HAN Getting kinda romantic in here.
Chewie suggests with a GROWL that Han pay attention to the
business at hand. Han returns to work.
HAN (to Chewie) What are you so grouchy about?
"THREEPIO Sir, I’m almost afraid to ask, but does shutting down all"
but emergency power systems include me?
"Chewie BARKS yes, but Han think otherwise."
"HAN No, we’re going to need you to talk to the ship and find out what"
"happened to our hyperdrive… How good are you with a macrofuser,"
Your Holiness?
"Suddenly the ship lurches, causing all the loose items in the cockpit"
to go flying. Chewie HOWLS.
LEIA A tremor!
"THREEPIO (to Han) Sir, it’s very possible this asteroid is not"
stable. HAN I’m glad you’re here to tell us these things…
The ship begins a violent motion. Chewie HOWLS.
HAN Hang on! Watch out.
The jolting movement throws Leia across the cabin into Han’s arms.
The motion stops as suddenly as it started. Han and Leia realize they
are in each others arms. The pirate grins down at the girl. Chewie
watches the embrace with inscrutable interest.
"HAN Why, Princess, this is so sudden."
LEIA Very funny. You can let go now… I’m getting angry.
HAN You don’t look angry.
LEIA How do I look?
HAN (with feeling) Beautiful.
"Leia flushes, averts her eyes. She’s not exactly fighting to get free."
"But, of course, Han blows it…"
HAN And excited.
The anger rises in Leia.
"LEIA Sorry, Captain, being held by you isn’t enough to get me"
excited.
"HAN Well, I hope you don’t expect more."
"LEIA I don’t expect anything, except to be left alone."
HAN Fine with me. But I’m afraid you’ll have to let go. Han has lifted
"his arms lightly away, which makes it very clear that Leia has, in fact,"
"been returning his embrace. Leia realizes this and steps back,"
embarrassed and angry. Her words are measured.
LEIA Don’t you think it’s time we got to work on your ship…
"She turns and leaves the cockpit. Han turns to his faithful Wookiee,"
who’s been watching all this with Threepio.
"HAN Come on, Chewie, let’s tear into this flying short circuit before"
we get hit with another tremor.
Chewie BARKS and starts out of the cockpit with Han.
"HAN You, too, golden rod."
THREEPIO I must admit there are times I don’t understand human
behavior. 283. EXT BOG CLEARING – DUSK
"The mist has disappeared a bit, but it is still a gloomy looking swamp."
The X wing fighter has stopped sinking and is now only about one
third above water. A transfer cable has been rigged between the
starfighter and the shore. Artoo is on the back of the fighter sending a
power case to Luke on the edge of the swamp.
"LUKE I think that will do it, Artoo. Come on back."
Luke hears a loud snapping crash in the dense jungle right behind
"him. It is too dark to see anything, but Luke already has his light"
"saber in his hand, waiting to be ignited. Nothing emerges from the"
obscure foliage so Luke clips his weapon back to his utility belt and
"continues to unpack the gear. Meanwhile, Artoo has hooked a pulley"
from his midsection to the transport cable and is whizzing toward his
master. The stubby little droid lands with a beep.
LUKE You ready for some power? Luke has ignited a little fusion
"furnace which throws off a warm glow. He warms his hands, then"
plugs a power cable into Artoo’s nose. The droid whistles his
appreciation. Luke opens a container of processed food and sits
before the thermal heater.
LUKE Now all I have to do is find this Yoda… if he even exists.
Artoo beeps and Luke nervously looks around at the foreboding
jungle. He grimaces as he forces down the ill-tasting food.
LUKE This seems like a strange place to find a Jedi master… Gives
me the creeps. (Artoo beeps “I’m with you”) … There’s something
familiar about this place… I feel like…
STRANGE VOICE You feel like what?
Luke jumps out of his skin. Artoo screeches in terror. The young
"warrior grabs for his light saber as he spins around, looking for the"
"speaker. Mysteriously, standing right in front of Luke is a strange,"
"blue creature, not more than two feet tall. The wizened little thing is"
dressed in rags. It motions toward Luke’s sword.
LUKE (looking at creature) … Like we’re being watched.
CREATURE Away put your weapon. I mean you no harm.
"After some hesitation, Luke puts away his weapon, although he really"
doesn’t understand why. Artoo watches with interest.
CREATURE (Continued) I’m wondering… why are you here?
LUKE I’m looking for someone. CREATURE Looking? Looking?
You’ve found someone I’d say. Heh? Yes!
LUKE (trying to keep from smiling) Yeah…
CREATURE Help you I can… yes… yes.
LUKE I’m looking for a great warrior.
CREATURE A great warrior? (shakes his head) Not many on those.
Wars don’t make one great.
Yoda jumps and lands on one of the cases of supplies. He begins to
rummage around.
LUKE Get away from there.
Artoo moves to the edge of the case (almost eye level to the creature
who is carelessly handling the supplies) and squeaks his disapproval.
The creature picks up the container of food Luke was eating from and
takes a bite.
"LUKE Hey, that’s my dinner!"
The creature spits out the bite he has taken. He makes a face.
"CREATURE Peewh! Awful, awful. Thank you, no. How get you so big"
eating food of this kind?
He flips the container in Luke’s direction and reaches into one of
Luke’s supply cases.
"LUKE Listen, friend, we didn’t mean to land here, and if I could get"
"my fighter out of this puddle I would, but I can’t. So…"
CREATURE Can’t get your ship out? Have you tried? Have you
tried? The creature spots something of interest in Luke’s case; Luke
loses patience and grabs the case away. The creature retains his
prize… a tiny power lamp. The creature examines it with delight.
LUKE Give me that!
CREATURE (retreating with it) Mine! Mine! Or I’ll help you not.
"Clutching the lamp, the creature backs away from Luke right into"
"Artoo, who the creature barely recognizes as animate. But as the"
"following exchange takes place, one of Artoo’s little arms slowly"
"moves out toward the power lamp, completely unnoticed by the"
creature.
LUKE I don’t want your help. I want my lamp back. I’ll need it in this
slimy mudhole.
CREATURE Mudhole? Slimy? My home this is.
Artoo grabs hold of the lamp and the two little figures are immediately
engaged in a tug-of-war over it.
ARTOO Beeps a few “gimme thats.”
"CREATURE Mine, mine. Give it back."
The creature lets go with one hand and pokes Artoo lightly with one
finger.
"Artoo reacts big with a squeal, and lets go."
"CREATURE Mine, mine."
"LUKE (fed up) Okay, Artoo, let him have it. Now get out of here, little"
"fellow, we’ve got things to do. CREATURE No, no! I’ll stay and help"
you find your friend.
LUKE I’m not looking for a friend. I’m looking for a Jedi Master.
"CREATURE Oh, a Jedi Master. Different altogether. Yoda you seek,"
Yoda.
LUKE (surprised and skeptical) You know the Jedi Master?
"CREATURE Of course, yes. But now eat we must. Good food, I have"
"good food. Come, come."
"With that, the creature scurries out of the clearing and down a path"
"which is suddenly more apparent than before. Luke looks after him,"
"thinking, then starts that way."
ARTOO (quite upset) Whistles a blue streak.
LUKE (to Artoo) You’d better stay here and watch over the camp.
ARTOO Beeps even more frantically.
Luke is almost out of sight. He yells back.
"LUKE Artoo, now settle down… I can take care of myself… I’ll be"
safe… okay?
The little droid grows quiet as Luke disappears from view. 284. EXT

Darth Vader stands before a shimmering holographic image which
"slowly comes into focus. The image is that of SATE PESTAGE,"
"Grand Vizier to His Eminence, Emperor."
"VADER Sate Pestage, I would see the Emperor. He commands it."
"PESTAGE I must warn you, Lord Vader, The Emperor is in a foul"
mood. He bids you wait. Have you any progress to report?

hiding. A faint ball of light emerges from the crater as a bomb hits
bottom. 289. INT MAIN HOLD AREA – MILLENNIUM FALCON
The ship rattles and vibrates. Threepio is sitting at the main control
panel. The flooring and part of the ceiling have been removed
revealing a section of the complex powertrain. Chewie’s head pops
upside-down out of a bundle of wires in the ceiling. He BARKS. Han
looks up from where he’s working in one of the floor compartments.
"Princess Leia, who is welding something nearby, also stops working"
and looks up at Chewie.
HAN That was no earthquake.
LEIA Felt like a hydro concussion… an Imperial Cruiser.
"THREEPIO Oh my, they’ve found us."
"Everyone is quiet for a moment, waiting for a second blast. A very"
slight vibration is felt.
LEIA They’re moving away.
HAN They’re just trying to see if they can stir something up… we’re
safe.
LEIA Where have I heard that before?
"Han ignores her sarcasm and moves past her, rubbing against her in"
"the tight quarters, to continue his work. She watches him for a"
"moment, then goes back to her welding. Threepio whistles and beeps"
into the control panel in front of him and the control panel whistles
back. THREEPIO Where is Artoo when I need him? I don’t know
"where your ship learned to communicate, but its dialect leaves"
something to be desired. It says the power coupling on the negative
"axis has been polarized. You’ll have to replace it, I’m afraid."
CHEWIE Barks his understanding and returns to his wires.
Leia finishes welding the valve she’s been working on. She attempts
to reengage the system by pulling on a lever attached to the valve. It
"doesn’t budge. Han notices her struggle, and moves to help her. She"
rebuffs him.
"HAN Easy, your worship. Only trying to help."
LEIA (still struggling) Would you please stop calling me that?
Han hears a new tone in her voice. He watches her pull on the lever.
HAN Sure. I guess I make it difficult sometimes.
"LEIA Yes, you do."
"HAN You could be a touch warmer, though. (he watches her"
"reaction) Admit it, against your better judgment you think I’m all right."
She lets go of the lever and rubs her sore hand.
"LEIA (a little smile, haltingly) Sometimes, maybe… occasionally,"
when you aren’t acting like a scoundrel. HAN (laughs) That’s quite a
compliment.
"With that, Han takes her hand, turns it over and presses his lips into"
her palm.
LEIA Stop that.
HAN Why?
"Leia is flushed, confused."
LEIA My hands are dirty.
Han kisses her hand again. Leia yanks it away and steps back. She
"can only move a few feet in the cramped space, but Han does not"
follow her.
HAN What are you afraid of?
LEIA Afraid of? Certainly not you Captain Solo… or any other man in
this galaxy.
"Han looks at her with a piercing look. He’s never looked handsomer,"
"more dashing, more confident. He reaches out slowly and takes"
Leia’s hand again from where it is resting on a console. He draws it
toward him.
HAN Then why are you trembling?
"Then, with an irresistible combination of physical strength and"
"emotional power, the space pirate begins to draw Leia toward him…"
very slowly.
HAN You know what I think? I think you like me because I’m a
scoundrel. I think you haven’t run into enough scoundrels in your life.
Leia is now very close and the following exchange takes place as
"their faces draw even nearer. Leia’s voice is and excited whisper, in"
complete opposition to what she’s saying. LEIA Don’t count on it. I
happen to like nice men.
"HAN Sure, they’re safer. You always know what they’re going to do."
"Trouble is, it gets a little dull."
LEIA There’s nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be
civilized.
HAN You mean a man you can control.
LEIA I do not!
HAN Try and control this…
"He kisses her now, with slow hot lips. He takes his time, as though he"
"had forever, bending her body backward. She has never been kissed"
"like this before, and it almost makes her faint. When he stops, she"
"regains her breath and tries to work up some indignation, but finds it"
hard to talk.
LEIA You’re wrong… This isn’t what… (he begins to kiss her
again) … not what I… want…
"His mouth stops her. A swimming giddiness spins her around until,"
"before she knows it, she is kissing him back. Finally, Han breaks the"
kiss and looks at her. They stand there for a moment looking at each
"other. Leia is totally, frantically confused by her feelings. First with her"
"eyes, then with her body, she withdraws, detaches from Han. She"
slips from his arms and hurries from the cabin.
"Han stares after her thoughtfully, then turns his attention to the stuck"
"lever. He gives it a confident, mighty pull. It doesn’t budge."
HAN Chewie! Gimme a hand with this. 290. EXT BOG – EDGE OF

foreboding. A light slapping sound can be heard across the water.

"direction. He feels very alone, and attempts to warm several of his"
utility arms in front of the thermal heater. He whimpers a nervous little
whistle. 291. EXT BOG MEADOW – CREATURE’S HOUSE –

"The inside of the house is very plain, but cozy. Everything is in the"
same scale as the creature. The only thing out of place in the
"miniature room is Luke, who is cramped by the four foot ceiling. He"
sits crossedlegged on the floor of the living room.
"The creature is in an adjoining area, which serves as the kitchen,"
cooking up some incredible meal. The stove is a steaming
hodgepodge of pots and pans. The wizened little creature scurries
"about chopping this, shredding that and showering everything with"
exotic herbs and spices. He rushes back and forth putting platters on
"the table in front of Luke, who watches the creature impatiently."
"LUKE … I told you, I’m not hungry."
CREATURE Patience. It’s time to eat.
"LUKE Look, it smells good. I’m sure it’s delicious But I don’t know"
why we can’t see Yoda now.
"CREATURE It’s the Jedi’s time to eat, too."
LUKE Will it take long to get there? How far away is
"he? CREATURE Not far, not far. Be patient. Soon you will see him."
Why wish you become a Jedi?
"LUKE Because of my father, I guess."
"CREATURE (placing food on the table) Oh, your father… a powerful"
"Jedi was he, powerful Jedi."
LUKE (a little angry) How could you know my father? You don’t even
know who I am. (fed-up) Can’t we get on with this already?
The creature turns away from Luke and speaks to a third party.
CREATURE (irritated) No good is this. This will not do. I cannot teach
him. The boy has no patience!
Luke’s head spins in that direction. He is startled to see the
shimmering image of Ben Kenobi.
LUKE Ben!
Ben is focused on the creature. They ignore Luke for the moment.
"The boy is bewildered, but over the next few exchanges it dawns on"
"him that the little creature is YODA, the Jedi Master."
BEN He will learn patience.
"YODA Much anger in him, like in his father."
BEN We’ve discussed this before.
LUKE I can be a Jedi. I’m ready. Yoda sits across the table from
Luke.
YODA Ready are you? What know you of ready? I have trained Jedi
for 800 years. My own counsel I’ll keep on who is to be trained.
LUKE Why not me?
"YODA To become a Jedi takes the deepest commitment, the most"
serious mind.
BEN He can do it.
"YODA (to Ben, indicating Luke) This one I have watched a long time."
"All his life has he looked away… to the horizon, to the sky, to the"
"future. Never his mind on where he was, on what he was doing."
"Adventure, excitement… (turning to Luke) A Jedi craves not these"
things!
"Luke looks down, knows it’s true."
LUKE I have followed my feelings.
YODA You are reckless!
BEN He’ll learn.
YODA He’s too old. Yes. Too old to start the training.
Luke thinks he hears a tiny softening.
LUKE But it hasn’t been wasted time. I’ve learned much already.
"Yoda turns his piercing gaze on Luke, as though the Jedi Master’s"
huge eyes could somehow determine how much the boy has learned.
"After a long moment, the little creature turns toward Ben, who meets"
his look evenly and seems almost to nod. YODA Will he finish what
he begins?
BEN We’ve come this far… He is our only hope.
Yoda concedes with a resigned look and Ben’s image fades away.
Yoda continues to stare at the spot for a long time.

A twelve foot hologram of the GALACTIC EMPEROR materializes
"before Vader. The Emperor’s face cannot be seen, for it is shrouded"
"in dark robes with a monk’s hood, reminiscent of the cloak worn by"
old Ben Kenobi. His voice is even deeper and more frightening than

"EMPEROR You may rise, my servant."
"Vader rises, but he is afraid of his master and continually looks at his"
feet.
"VADER What is thy bidding, My Master?"
EMPEROR There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
VADER I have felt it. EMPEROR Our situation is most precarious. We
have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction.
VADER Our destruction? Who?
EMPEROR The son of Skywalker. You must destroy him… or he will
be our undoing.
"VADER He’s not a Jedi, he’s just a boy. Obi-wan could not have"
taught him so much that…
EMPEROR You are weak! I have seen it. The Force is strong with
him. He must be destroyed.
"VADER But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally."

"hand across the control panel as she thinks of Han, and the"
confusion he’s created within her. Something catches her eye outside
"the cockpit window. With the reflection of the dash lights, it’s hard to"
make out what it is. She moves closer to the glass and peers into the

"Leia is startled and jumps back into her seat, her heart pounding."

that should do it.

drops the final floor panel into place.
LEIA There’s something out there!
HAN Where?
"LEIA Outside, in the cave."
There’s a sharp BANGING on the hull. Chewie looks up and BARKS.
THREEPIO It sounds like it’s trying to get in.

LEIA Are you crazy!
"HAN Look, we just got this bucket going again. I’m not about to let"
some varmint tear it apart… He grabs a breath mask off a rack and
the Wookiee does likewise. Leia follows.

jutting cockpit. A five foot shape can be seen moving across the top
of the Falcon. The leathery creature lets out a screech as Han blasts
"it with a laser bolt. The black shape stumbles, then tumbles off the"
spaceship and lands at the feet of the Princess. She leans over and
studies the thing.
LEIA Looks like some kind of Mynock.
HAN (looking around) There will be more of them. They always travel
in groups. And there’s nothing they like better than to attach
themselves to ships. Just what we need right now.
Leia stamps her foot on the floor of the cave.
LEIA This asteroid has the strangest consistency… Look at the
"ground, it’s not like rock at all."
"Han kneels and studies the ground, then attempts to study the outline"
of the cave. There is a Mynock screech in the distance.
HAN There’s an awful lot of moisture in here.
Han unholsters his blaster and fires at the far side of the huge cave.

buckle. HAN I was afraid of that…

it’s safe to.
Han rushes past her and heads for the cockpit.

legs straddle the branch and clasped in his webbed feet is Luke’s
"laser sword. On the ground below, Luke sets himself up and jumps"
"toward Yoda. He jumps incredibly well for a human, but it doesn’t"

Luke runs through the dense jungle on the last leg of what must have
been quite a marathon. Yoda rides in a pouch on Luke’s back. The
young apprentice is sweaty and exhausted. He stumbles into the
clearing where Artoo has been patiently waiting. As Luke is about to
"collapse, Yoda throws a small metal bar in front of him. Luke ignites"
his laser sword and swings at it. He missed and the bar falls to the
ground. Luke does too.
LUKE (breathless) I can’t… Too tired.
"YODA It would be in seven pieces, were you a Jedi."

Luke’s feet. Yoda taps Luke’s leg. Luke focusing and quickly removes
"one hand. His body wavers, but he maintains his balance."
Artoo races up to his master whistling and beeping like mad. Luke is

YODA So sure are you? Tried have you? Always with you it can’t be
done. Hear you nothing that I say?
Luke looks uncertainly out at the ship.
"LUKE Master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little"
different. YODA (irritated) No! No different! The differences are in

Luke lies motionless in the mud with Artoo leaning over him. Two
glowing balls about the size of baseballs hover above them like
mosquitoes and occasionally the angry Artoo swats at them; they
move just out of the stubby droid’s reach. Artoo whistles to his master
"several times, but gets no response. Artoo turns toward Yoda, who is"
"sitting quietly nearby chewing on his Gimer Stick, and begins to"
furiously beep and scold the little Jedi Master. Artoo turns back to
Luke. A small metal electrode projects out of Artoo and rests on
"Luke’s chest. There is a concerned whistle from the droid, a short"
"electronic yap, and Luke jumps awake with a start. The young Jedi"
shakes his head clear and rubs his shoulder. He is very angry; his
glare moves between Yoda and the two glowing balls.
YODA (jovial) Concentration. Heh? Concentration.
LUKE (pissed) I thought those seekers were set for stun!
YODA That they are.
LUKE They’re a lot stronger than I’m used to.
YODA That would matter not were The Force flowing through you.
Higher you’d jump! Faster you’d move! Open yourself to The Force
you must.
Artoo scoots away as the fed-up Luke grabs his laser sword from the
"mud, ignites it and jumps up."
LUKE I’m open to it now! I feel it. Come on you little flying blasters!
As he moves toward the hovering balls with a poised saber and
"ferocious look, they draw away, retreating to the area around Yoda’s"
head.
"YODA No, no. This will not do. Anger is what you feel."
LUKE But I feel The Force flowing!
"YODA Anger, fear, aggression! The dark side of The Force are they."
"Easily they flow… quick to join you in a fight. Beware, beware,"
beware of them. A heavy price is paid for the power they bring. Luke
"lowers his light saber, confused."
LUKE Price? What do you mean?
"YODA The dark side beckons. But if once start down the dark path,"
forever will it dominate your destiny. Consume you it will… as it did
Obi-wan’s apprentice.
LUKE Lord Vader… Is the dark side stronger?
"YODA No, no. Easier, quicker, more seductive."
LUKE But how am I to know the good side from the dark?
YODA You will know. When you are at peace… calm… passive. A
Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense. Never for attack.
LUKE But tell me why…
YODA No! Nothing more will I tell you now. Clear your mind of
questions… Quiet now be… at peace…
"Luke stops protesting, relaxes his body."
YODA … Yes… calm…
"Luke closes his eyes, tries to clear his thoughts."
YODA (soothing) … passive… Let yourself go…
"After a long moment, Yoda makes the tiniest little gesture and the two"
"glowing balls near his head race toward Luke, firing stun bolts. Luke"
"immediately springs to life, but in a lovely, graceful way. He moves"
"incredibly fast, deflecting bolts thrown at him from all directions,"
jumping incredibly high. The seeker attack stops as suddenly as it
started and the two balls retreat to either side of Yoda’s head. Artoo
lets out a sigh and shakes his head. Luke grins proudly at Yoda who
continues to chew away.
"YODA Much progress do you make, young one. Stronger do you"
grow.
Luke is bursting with his achievement as two more glowing seekers
"float into view from behind Yoda’s back, making a poised line of four"

"draws back only a moment, then pushes deeper into the cave."

Lando glances longingly over his shoulder at Leia who is following
behind the two old friends.
"LANDO That won’t be easy, my friend… What brings you here,"
anyway?
HAN Repairs…
LANDO (mock panic) What have you done to my ship?
"Han smiles, explains over his shoulder to Leia."
HAN Lando used to own the Falcon. And he sometimes forgets that
"he lost it fair and square. Lando concedes this with a little gesture,"
speaks to Leia.
LANDO That ship saved my life a few times. It’s the fastest hunk of
machinery in the galaxy. (to Han) What’s wrong with her?
HAN Hyperdrive.
LANDO I’ll have my people get to work on it right away. Hate the
thought of the Millennium Falcon without her heart. 354. INT

The group has crossed the narrow bridge and entered the city. They
"walk down the lovely art-deco passageway, rounding several corners"
and passing many small plazas as they go. Threepio legs a bit
behind.
HAN How’s your mining operation going?
LANDO Not as well as I’d like. We’re a small outpost and not very
selfsufficient. I’ve had supply problems of every kind and… (catches
Han grinning at him) What’s so funny?
HAN Nothing. I never would have guessed that underneath that wild
schemer I knew was a responsible leader and businessman… But
you wear it well.
"Lando is reflective, he looks at Han a moment."
LANDO Seeing you sure brings back a few things… (shakes his
"head) Yeah, I’m responsible these days. It’s the price of success. And"
"you know what, Han, you were right all along. It’s over-rated. Han and"
"Lando laugh together. As the lagging Threepio passes a doorway, he"
hears the muffled beeping and whistling of an R-2 unit. 355. INT

"THREEPIO Oh, an R-2 unit, I’d almost forgotten what they sound"
like…
"As Threepio is about to reach another doorway, the door to the main"
passage closes behind him. He looks into the room.
THREEPIO Oh my!… Those look like…
A laserbolt to Threepio’s chest sends him flying in twenty directions.
Smoldering mechanical arms and legs bounce off the walls. 356. INT

Again Yoda sits on the high branch with Luke’s laser sword clasped
"in his webbed feet. Far below, Luke sets, then jumps. This time he"

Artoo is busy washing down the X wing fighter. A powerful stream of
"water sprays from a nozzle in the droid’s side, while a hose from his"
other side trails off into the watery swamp. Luke and Yoda are sitting
in the camp facing each other. The young warrior’s eyes are closed.
"YODA Be calm. Through The Force, things you will see: other places,"
"other thoughts, the future, the past, old friends long gone."
BEN’S VOICE How’s the boy doing?
YODA A most gifted apprentice… if concentrate he would!
Luke turns to see the image of Ben fade away.
LUKE Ben? Ben?
YODA Free your mind and return he will.
LUKE My mind fills with so many images.
"YODA Control, control you must learn of what you see. Not easy, not"
fast.
LUKE I see a city in the clouds.
"YODA Bespin. I see it too… Friends you have there, heh?"
Concentrate and see them you will.
LUKE I see them!… They’re in pain… they’re suffering.
"YODA It is the future you see. As Luke moans, Artoo stops his work"
"and rushes over to his master and starts beeping angrily at Yoda,"
crowding him.
LUKE Will they die?
"YODA Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future… Back away,"
little machine!
Yoda lifts his hand towards the pushing droid and Artoo lets out a
"quick shriek of shock and moves away, mumbling and looking back at"
Yoda. Luke has started to gather up his things.
LUKE They’re my friends.
"YODA Foreknowledge is helpful, but painful sometimes and"
dangerous too. You have far to go in your training.
Luke is stopped cold by Yoda’s words. Gloom shrouds him as he
plops down and Artoo comes over to comfort him. 359X. INT JUNK

QUARTERS – CLOUD CITY – DAY – BESPIN
Sunlight pours through the skylight in a large art-deco living area onto
which four apartments open. Han slouches in a lounge chair with his
feet on a table. He aims his blaster at a glow globe and makes a firing
sound with his tongue. He turns to see Leia standing in the doorway
to her apartment. Han is knocked out by the sight. He holsters his
blaster distractedly as he ogles the radiant Leia. She has changed
from her cold weather pants and jacket to a lovely dress. Her hair is
"up, tied with ribbons. LEIA What are you staring at?"
HAN (ga-ga) Who’s staring?
LEIA You look silly.
HAN You look great.
LEIA (embarrassed) Has Threepio turned up yet?
HAN Huh? Oh. Your droid’s been gone too long just to be lost. He
may have gotten into some trouble. Chewie went to look for him. (he
pats a spot on his lounge) Come over here. I want to check this out.
"Leia thinks it over a moment, then walks over and settles next to Han,"
who’s overjoyed with her apparent pliancy. he’s about to envelop her
when she throws on the ice water…
LEIA I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right.
HAN Luke! I’m sure he’s fine. Probably sitting around wondering what
we’re doing right now.
Han puts his arm around her. They are ready to kiss. The door zaps
"open. Chewbacca walks in carrying a packing case of Threepio, arms"
and legs hanging over the edge. He drops the box on the table.
CHEWIE Barks at his master.
LEIA What happened?
HAN He found him in a junk pile… LEIA Something’s wrong here.
"Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don’t trust him."
"HAN Well, I do trust him. Lando’s an old friend. Must have been an"
"accident. LEIA Chewie, do you think you can repair him?"
The giant Wookiee has been studying the array of robot parts. He
looks at the Princess.
CHEWIE Howls and shrugs his shoulders.
HAN Why don’t we just turn him over to Lando to fix?
LEIA No thanks.
"HAN Look, sweetheart, I’m not going to have you accusing my friend"
of…
There is a BUZZ and the door slides open revealing Lando and a pair
of body guards.
"LANDO Sorry, am I interrupting anything?"
LEIA Not really.
"LANDO I must say, your beauty is unparalleled. Truly you belong"
here with us among the clouds.
LEIA (icy) Thanks.
LANDO Would you care to join me for a little refreshment?
Han looks at Lando suspiciously.
CHEWIE Barks at the mention of food. Licks his lips.
"LANDO Everyone’s invited, of course."
Leia takes Lando’s proffered arm and the group turns to go. Lando
spots Threepio’s remains. LANDO Having problems with you droid?
Han and Leia exchange a quick glance.
HAN An accident. Nothing we can’t handle.
"The door slides closed behind them, leaving the battered droid on the"
table. 361. INT CORRIDOR – CLOUD CITY – DAY
Leia walks between Han and Lando as Chewie and the two
bodyguards follow a short distance behind. Long shafts of light pour
across the corridor between tall columns.
LANDO … We are a free station and do not fall under the jurisdiction
of the Empire.
LEIA You’re part of the mining guild then?
LANDO Not actually… Our operation is small enough not to be
"noticed, so you might say we’re enterprisers. Most of our trade is,"
well… unofficial. 362. EXT VERANDA – CLOUD CITY – DAY
The corridor opens onto a veranda which overlooks the spiraled top

below the city. It’s connected by a transfer shaft. 363. INT

They re-enter the corridor and head for a huge doorway at the far
end. Chewie begins to sniff something.
CHEWIE Barks at Han.
"HAN Not now, Chewie. Lando, aren’t you afraid the Empire might"
discover this little operation and shut you down?
LANDO That’s always been the danger. It’s loomed like a shadow
over everything we’ve built here. But circumstances have developed
"which will insure security. You see, I’ve just made a deal that will"
keep the Empire out of here forever… 364. INT DINING ROOM –
CLOUD CITY – DAY
The mighty doors to the dining room slide open and the group enters
"the elegant room. At the far end of a huge banquet table sits, Darth"
"Vader. At his side and slightly behind him is standing Bobo Fett, the"
bounty hunter. Han gives Lando a mean look.
"LANDO Sorry friend, I had no choice. They arrived right before you"
did.
HAN I’m sorry too.
"Faster than the wink of an eye, Han has drawn his blaster and"
popped off a couple of quick shots directly at Vader. The Dark Lord
"quickly raises his hand, deflecting the bolts into one of the side walls,"
"where they explode harmlessly. Just as quickly, Han’s weapon zips"
out of his grip and mysteriously flies across the room into Vader’s
hand. The evil presence calmly places the gun on the table in front of
him.
"VADER I’m glad you could join us. Have some nourishment, for it will"
be your last meal. 365. EXT YODA’S BOG (MONTAGE) –

"In the bog clearing, Yoda watches as Luke stares at two equipment"
cases from the supplies of his fighter. Artoo watches from nearby.
Now the two cases lift into the air and exchange places. Luke smiles
to himself feeling strong and playful. Now he lifts the two equipment
"cases again, plus a bewildered, beeping Artoo, who is roughly the"
same size. 366. EXT YODA’S HOUSE (MONTAGE) – DAGOBAH
"Luke is squatting before Yoda’s little stove, working over a chaos of"
"steaming pots, chopping, stirring and sprinkling in a manner strongly"
"reminiscent of Yoda, who, by the way, is not around. Suddenly a"
painful vision fills Luke’s mind; he winces and stops his cooking for a
"few moments. It passes away, Luke shakes it off and goes back to"
"his cooking. After a few long beats, behind Luke’s back and unseen"
"by him, three of Yoda’s glowing-ball seekers float quietly into view."
"They pause, then race toward Luke firing stun bolts. The young Jedi"
"instantly twists to face them, deflecting all the bolts with the pot lid in"
his left hand and the spoon in his right. 367. EXT YODA’S HOUSE –

It is almost dark… in the woods a tiny light moves towards us… finally
we see it is Artoo… he stops within sight of Yoda’s house. A warm
light pours out of the house illuminating Luke who is asleep on the
ground. A blanket lies half-off Luke; Artoo carefully pulls it up to fully
cover Luke. As Artoo moves away Luke begins reacting to a
nightmare. He moans… opens his eyes wide and sits up. Yoda
comes to the doorway and looks out.
LUKE (to Yoda) I can’t keep the vision out of my head… My friends…
they’re in trouble… I feel that…
Suddenly the shimmering image of Ben Kenobi appears before Luke.
"BEN … Luke, you must not go."
LUKE But Han and Leia will surely die. BEN You don’t know that.
Even I cannot see their fate.
LUKE I can help them!
BEN You’re not ready yet. You still have much to learn.
LUKE I feel The Force.
"BEN But you cannot control it. This is a dangerous time for you, Luke."
You are now most susceptible to the temptations of the dark side.
"YODA Yes, yes. To Obi-wan you listen young one. The tree."
Remember your failure at the tree! Heh?
LUKE I’ve learned so much since then. And I’ll return to finish… I
"promise that, master."
BEN Will you? You underestimate The Emperor. It is you he wants…
that is why your friends suffer.
LUKE And that is why I must go.
"BEN Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader."
LUKE You won’t.
"BEN Only a fully trained Jedi Knight, with The Force as his ally, will"
"conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you"
choose the quick and easy path… as Vader did… you will become an
agent of evil… and the galaxy will be plunged deeper into the abyss
"of hate, despair and pain that you feel your friends suffering"
now. YODA Stopped they must be. Do you hear? On this all
depends.
"BEN You are the last Jedi, Luke. You are our only hope. Be patient."
LUKE And sacrifice Han and Leia?
YODA If it must be. Yes.
"Luke is in great anguish. He struggles with the dilemma, a battle"
"raging in his head. But then there is a clearing in his expression, a"
choice made.
"LUKE I cannot. Ben, I must go. Now that I can see their suffering, I"
must help…
Luke looks for a long moment at Ben and Yoda. Then he turns and
starts toward his ship followed by his faithful droid. Yoda looks at Ben
"with a certain irritation, but Ben is focusing on Luke. The old man’s"
expression is resigned. 367X. EXT X WING FIGHTER – EDGE OF

The fighter’s lights come on. Luke is in the process of hoisting a
heavy case into the belly of the ship by a cable. Artoo is on top of the
ship settling down into his place. Luke stops what he is doing as Ben
appears. Yoda steps into the light.
"BEN I cannot protect you, Luke. If you choose to face Vader, you will"
"do it alone. Once you’ve made this decision, I cannot interfere."
Artoo unfastens power couplings on the ship. LUKE I understand. (to
"Yoda) I’ll be back, Master Yoda. I will finish what I have begun I give"
"you my word. Artoo, fire up the power converters."
ARTOO Whistles a happy reply.
"BEN Luke, use The Force only for knowledge and for defense, not as"
a weapon. Don’t give in to hate or anger or fear… they lead the way
to the dark side…
Luke nods and climbs back into his ship.
YODA Strong is Vader. Clouded is your fate. Mind what you have
"learned… Notice everything, everything! It can save you."
"LUKE I will, master, I will!"
Artoo closes the cockpit. Ben and Yoda stand watching as the roar of
the engines and the wind engulfs them.
"YODA Told you, I did. Reckless is he… Now things are going to"
worse.

four beds. A disassembled Threepio rests on one of the beds. The
Wookiee picks up the golden droid’s head and meditates on it a few
moments. CHEWIE Barks a few remarks of a philosophical nature.
Chewie sticks the robot’s head on its torso and starts adjusting wires
"and circuits. Suddenly, the lights in Threepio’s eyes spark to life as"
Chewie touches two connectors together. Threepio immediately
"begins to speak, but his voice is so slow and so low as to be"
unintelligible.
THREEPIO Immmm-peer-eee-alll-storrr-mmmm-trooo…
"Chewie looks at Threepio in bewilderment, then scratches his furry"
"head, gets and idea and adjusts some connections. Threepio"
immediately begins speaking normally.

"exits the cell and is approached by Lando, Lando’s aide, and Boba"
Fett.
"VADER Bounty hunter, if you are waiting for your reward, you will"
wait until I have Skywalker.
"BOBA (a very tough customer) I am in no hurry, Lord Vader. My"
concern is that Captain Solo not be damaged. The reward from
Jabba the Hutt pays double if he’s alive.
"VADER His pain is considerable, bounty hunter, but he will not be"
harmed. LANDO What about Leia and the Wookiee?
VADER You will find them well enough. But they must never again
leave this city.
LANDO That was never mentioned. Neither was this bounty hunter
taking Han. I hope you haven’t forgotten our bargain.
"VADER I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you’re being"
treated unfairly.
LANDO (glances at his aide) No.
VADER Good. It would be most unfortunate if I had to leave a
permanent garrison here.
Vader turns and sweeps into the elevator with Boba Fett. Lando turns
with his aide and walks swiftly down another corridor.
LANDO This deal’s getting worse all the time.
AIDE Maybe you should have argued with him.
"Lando gives his aide a look that speaks volumes, then walks a few"
"steps in silence, thinking."
LANDO (finally) I’ve got a bad feeling about this. 372. INT LARGE

Chewie now has a little more of Threepio back together. One arm is
"connected, but his legs have yet to be attached. There is one small"
"problem, however; it appears the Wookiee has managed to put the"
"droid’s head on backwards. THREEPIO Well, something’s not right"
because now I can’t see. (Chewie barks and adjusts a wire) There
"now, that’s better, wait… Oh, my. What have you done? I’m"
backwards! You flea-bitten furball! Only an overgrown mophead like
you would be stupid enough to put my head…
Threepio is cut off in mid-sentence as Chewie deactivates a circuit
and the droid shuts down. The Wookiee smells something and sits
up. The door to the chamber slides open and a ragged Han Solo is
helped into the room by two Stormtroopers. The huge Wookiee gives
"him a hug as the Stormtroopers leave. Han is very pale, with dark"
circles under his eyes.
CHEWIE Barks his concern.
"HAN No, I’m alright. I’m alright."
Chewie BARKS again as the door slides open revealing Leia. She
"looks a little worse for war also. The troopers shove her into the cell,"
and the door slides closed. Chewie helps her up and over to Han.
"The two lovers embrace, kiss."
HAN I was worried about you.
LEIA I’m worried about all of us. I can’t figure out what they’re up to.
"HAN Me either. They had me howling on the scan grid, but they"
never asked me any questions.
The cell door slides open. Lando and two Bespin troops enter.
"HAN Get out of here, Lando! LANDO Shut up a minute and listen. I’m"
doing what I can to make this easier for you.
HAN This ought to be good.
LANDO Vader agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me. They’ll
"have to stay here, but at least they’ll be safe."
LEIA What about Han?
LANDO (to Han) I didn’t know you had a price on your head. Vader
has given you to the bounty hunter.
Leia looks with concern to Han.
HAN You don’t know much about much if you think Vader won’t want
us dead before this is over.
LANDO He doesn’t want you at all. He’s after someone named
Skywalker.
HAN Luke? I don’t get it.
Leia’s mind is racing.
LANDO Lord Vader has set a trap for him and…
LEIA … we’re the bait.
HAN All this just to get the kid? What’s so important about him?
"LANDO Don’t ask me, but he’s on his way. LEIA Luke’s coming here?"
Lando nods. Han’s rage peaks.
HAN You fixed us all pretty good… (spits it out) … friend!
Han hauls off and punches Lando. The two friends are instantly
engaged in a frantic close quarters fight. The guards hit Han with their
rifle butts and he flies across the room. Chewie GROWLS and starts
"for the guards. They point their laser weapons at the Giant Wookiee,"
but Lando stops them.
LANDO Don’t shoot! I’ve done what I can for you. I’m sorry it’s not
"better, but I’ve got my own problems. (turns to leave) I’ve already"
stuck my neck out further than I should…
"HAN Yeah, you’re a real hero."

opposite direction from Chewie’s and the droid is constantly twisting
around in a vain effort to see what’s happening. His one attached arm
"is animate and expressive, intermittently pointing, gesturing and"
covering his eyes. The remaining pieces of his body are roughly
bundled. to the Wookiee’s back. His legs and other arm stick out at
odd angles from the pack.
Vader turns to Boba Fett.

survive? This slime is worth a lot to me…

Chewie lets out a wild HOWL and attacks the Stormtroopers
surrounding Han. Within seconds many Imperial reinforcements have
joined the scuffle. The giant Wookiee is clubbed with laser weapons.
"From the instant of Chewie’s first move, Threepio is screaming in"
panic while he tries to protect himself with his one
"arm… THREEPIO Wait! What are you doing?… Oh, no… Don’t hit"
"me! No! He doesn’t mean it!… Calm down, you hairy fool!… Ouch! I"
didn’t do anything…
The Stormtroopers are about to bash Chewie in the face.
"HAN Chewie, no! Stop it, Chewbacca!"
Han breaks away from his captors. Vader nods to the guards to let
him go and the pirate breaks up the fight.
"THREEPIO Oh, yes… stop, stop. Thank heavens…"
"Han gives the Wookiee a stern look, then a big hug."
"HAN Save your strength for another time, Chewie, when the odds are"
better.
Han winks at the Wookiee.
CHEWIE Barks a doleful farewell.
"HAN I’m sure I’ll see you again, too. Keep well. (turns to guard) You’d"
better chain him until it’s over.
"In a flash the guards have slipped binders on Chewbacca, who is too"
distraught to protest. Han gives his furry friend a final hug and turns
to Princess Leia. He takes her in his arms and she gives him a
passionate kiss.
"LEIA … I love you. I couldn’t tell you before, but it’s true."
"HAN … just remember that, ’cause I’ll be back… He sheds his cocky"
smile and gives her a soft kiss on the forehead. Tears roll down
Leia’s face as she watches the dashing pirate walk to the hydraulic
"platform. Lando, too, watches with anguish."
Imperial guards position Han on the platform and quickly bind his
arms and legs. They step back. Han looks one final time at his friends
and suddenly the platform drops. Han disappears into the steaming
vat of sub-zero cold. Chewie HOWLS. Leia turns away in agony.
Lando winces in sorrow; it makes a life-changing impression on him.
"Instantly, a ladle of fiery liquid moves over the vat, tilts and pours,"
creating a shower of sparks and fluid as great as any steel furnace.
"Chewie has half turned away from the sight, giving Threepio a view of"
the procedure.
THREEPIO They’re encasing him in carbonite. It’s high quality alloy.
Much better than my own. He should be quite well protected… if he
survived the freezing process.
Chewie is in no mood for technical discussions; he gives the droid an
angry glance.

other direction. 384. INT CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER – CLOUD

Luke searches the complex chamber for any sign of an enemy. There
"is nothing. He walks forward toward the hydraulic platform, then"
"stops, holstering his gun."
"LUKE I know you’re with me, Lord Vader, I can feel your presence."
"Show yourself, or do you fear me?"
Vader steps into view behind Luke. the young Jedi turns instantly to
face his opponent.
"VADER The Force is with you young Skywalker, but you are not a"
Jedi yet. 385. INT CORRIDOR – CLOUD CITY – BESPIN – DAY
"Leia, Lando, Chewie and Threepio march along between four"
Stormtroopers. They reach an intersection where a dozen of Lando’s
guards are standing at attention. Lando stops before the sergeant of
the guard.
LANDO Code force seven.
The guards immediately aim their weapons at the startled
Stormtroopers. The sergeant takes the Stormtroopers weapons from
"them, handing one to Lando, the others to Chewie and Leia. They"
release Chewie’s binders. LANDO Hold them in the north tower.
Quietly! No one must know.
Lando’s guards march the Stormtroopers away.
LEIA What’s going on?
"LANDO I’m coming over to your side, that’s what. And I have a"
feeling I’m making a big mistake.
LEIA And when do you betray us again?
Lando has to take another look at this broad. She doesn’t seem very
appreciative.
"LANDO Look, I stand to lose everything by this."
LEIA We have no use for your kind.
"LANDO This is no time to be choosy, honey. What do you say we"
debate this later? There’s still a chance I can get you out of here.
CHEWIE Barks a blue streak.
LANDO What’s wrong with him?
THREEPIO (Very worried) Oh my. Oh no. He’s not interested in
escape. He wants to go after Captain Solo… Artoo!!
"In the distance, down a long hallway in the direction that Threepio is"
"facing, a familiar whistling can be heard. Artoo appears and zips up"
"toward the group. Chewie turns to see the stubby droid, causing"
Threepio to be spun away from his little friend.
"THREEPIO Wait! Where’d he go? Turn around, you woolly… Ah,"
Artoo! Artoo has managed to get under Threepio.
ARTOO Beeps a wild series of exclamations about his friend’s
condition.
THREEPIO Don’t ask.
LEIA Chewie’s right. We must try to save Han.
"LANDO (thinking fast) There’s not much chance, but the bounty"
hunter’s ship is on the East Landing Platform.
Lando leads the others quickly down a hall.
ARTOO Beeps wildly.
THREEPIO I’m afraid Lord Vader has Master Luke. There’s no hope
of saving him. 386. INT CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER – CLOUD
CITY – BESPIN
Vader ignites his powerful light saber. Luke takes a step back and
one foot rests on the cold chamber platform. He lights his laser sword
and sets himself to face the Dark Lord.
VADER The fear does not reach you. You have learned more than I
anticipated.
LUKE You’ll find I’m full of surprises.
VADER And I too.
"Vader brings his mighty sword down on Luke, who deftly blocks the"
"attack, but moves another step back in the process. He is now"
standing squarely on the hydraulic platform. VADER Your future lies
"with us, Skywalker. Now you will embrace the dark side. Obi-wan"
knew this to be true.
LUKE No!
"VADER There is much Obi-wan did not tell you. Come, The Emperor"
will complete your training.
LUKE I’ll die first.
VADER That won’t be necessary.
"With that, there is a slight rumble and the hydraulic platform"
"disappears into the vat of freezing steam, which rises to obscure"
Vader’s vision. He looks down into the steam.
VADER All too easy. Perhaps you are not as strong as The Emperor
thought.
LUKE (OS) Time will tell.
Vader looks up in surprise to see that Luke has leapt fifteen feet
straight up and is now hanging from some of the hoses on the
carbonite ladle. Luke yanks one of the hoses loose and swings to
safety on the far side of the platform. Vader moves toward Luke with
"overwhelming menace, his laser sword flaring."
VADER Your agility is impressive. Let’s see what other skills you’ve
learned.
A section of pipe tears loose from the wall and flies toward Luke.
"Luke cuts it into five pieces, which bounce around the chamber."
"VADER I feel it now… your fear, your anger. Good. Let The Force"
"flow. Hate me. I’m the one who destroyed your family. Cases, tools,"
"bits of pipe begin to fly at Luke. He cuts down or deflects them, but is"
driven back by their onslaught.
VADER Attack. Take your revenge. Destroy me.
Luke looks around for a means of escape. There is only one… a
round tunnel with pipes and conduit running through it. He makes his
way for it as Vader continues to hurtle objects at him.
VADER There is no escape. You will use the dark side of The
Force… or perish. Let your hate flow and save yourself.
Luke backs into the tunnel followed by Vader. 387. EXT BOBA’S

"LANDO It’s no use, they’re out of range."
"THREEPIO Oh my, no! A laser bolt explodes near the Princess and"
everyone turns to see what Threepio has already spotted coming
from the other direction: a squad of Stormtroopers running toward
them. Artoo peeks out from the elevator.
"LANDO Come on, let’s move!"
Leia and Chewbacca start firing at the troopers as Lando makes a
break for the elevator. Laser bolts continue to explode around the
"Princess and the Wookiee, but they refuse to budge. Lando sticks his"
head out of the elevator and motions for the pair to run. But they
"barely notice. They seem possessed, transported, as all the"
frustration of captivity and anger of loss pour out through their deathdealing
"weapons. Threepio, at the center of all this, is frantic."
"THREEPIO Artoo, help me! How did I get into this?… What a fate"
worse than death is to be strapped to the back of a Wookiee!
"LANDO Get in here! Now! Both of you, hurry up!"
"Reluctantly, Leia and Chewbacca move through the rain of laserfire"
"toward the elevator. Once they’re inside, the door slams shut and the"
Stormtroopers race forward. 391. INT ELEVATOR – CLOUD CITY –

Leia is out of breath as the levels slowly pass outside the translucent
windows. Lando watches the display panel.
LANDO You’re nuts!
"THREEPIO With all respect, I’m tempted to agree…"
LEIA We should have stayed and finished them off.
CHEWIE Barks his agreement.
LANDO You two almost signed off out there. THREEPIO Three! I
count three of us…
LEIA I don’t care. It would’ve been worth it… for Han.
CHEWIE Barks his “right on!”
"LANDO Very noble. Not smart, but noble."
LEIA You’ve probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
LANDO Sure I did… once. It turned out lousy.
LEIA What chance have we got in here? What are we going to do
when they cut…
"Suddenly, the elevator stops with a jolt and the main lights go out,"
leaving only the running lights.
LEIA … the power?
CHEWIE Howls.
ARTOO Whistles. 392. INT REACTOR CONTROL STATION
Vader’s powerful thrust and parry continues as Luke is forced back
into the cluttered control area of the monstrous reactor that powers
the city. Luke is obviously outmatched by the powerful Dark Lord of
the Sith; he must struggle to avoid Vader’s slashing sword. The laser
"weapon cuts through pipes and wires, causing steam, fluid and"
"sparks to fly everywhere. Luke moves behind a tall storage case,"
which is neatly cut in two by one of Vader’s blows. Several electronic
tools sitting on the control panel fly at Luke. He manages to deflect
"the projectiles and, at the same time, hold off his awesome opponent."
"But he is battered cut in several places, tired and somewhat dazed."
He stumbles and can’t catch his breath.
VADER You are beaten. It is useless to resist.
Luke lunges at Vader and attempts to put the Dark Lord on the
defensive. He succeeds in nicking the giant warrior on the shoulder.
"Vader reacts, but is quite unhurt."
VADER Don’t let yourself be destroyed as Obi-wan did.
Luke is breathing hard but the mention of Ben has a curious effect on
"him. He stands motionless for a moment, thinking. He closes his"
eyes.
LUKE (to himself) Knowledge and defense.
"A calm comes over Luke, as Vader raises his sword and starts"
"another attack. Using The Force, Vader hurtles large objects at Luke,"
but the boy deflects them with the good side of The Force.
Luke is backed up against a large round window. It over-looks a
"narrow scaffold and, beyond, an awesome abyss that drops away to"
the glowing reactor many miles below.
"VADER You will join me, or you will join Obi-wan in death!"
A large tool case rises and speeds toward Luke. He deflects it
"slightly, and it smashes through the window creating a massive rush"
of air. The gust knocks Luke off balance and sends him flying out the
window after the tool case. 393. INT ELEVATOR SHAFT
Lando climbs into the dimly lit elevator shaft from a door in the top of
"the elevator. There is no cable, but a great deal of mechanical and"
electronic gadgetry. Leia and Chewie can be seen inside the elevator
looking at him. Lando fiddles with several large braking devices and
then starts banging one with his weapon. LEIA You’d better know
"what you’re doing, or this is going to get very messy."
LANDO (completely dumbfounded) Don’t worry about a thing. I’ll get
us going. 394. INT ELEVATOR
Artoo has found a computer outlet in the side of the elevator control
"panel. Beeping and whistling madly, he inserts his control arm in the"
socket.
THREEPIO Artoo can release the brakes through the central controls.
Lando pops his head in as a loud clanking echoes through the shaft.
LANDO Then do it! They’re breaking in!
ARTOO Beeps a snappy okay.
"With a jolt, the brakes release and the elevator rockets into oblivion."
"Leia, Chewie and Threepio are smashed to the ceiling. 395. INT"

LANDO Reverse! Stop it! Stop! 396. INT ELEVATOR
"Artoo whistles madly, but the elevator doesn’t stop."
"THREEPIO Oh my, he’s lost contact. 397. INT ELEVATOR SHAFT"
Lando manages to hang on with one hand and fire his laser pistol at
the huge brake with the other. A direct hit and the brake snaps
"closed, stopping the elevator instantly with a loud, horrible"
SCREECH. 398. INT GANTRY OUTSIDE CONTROL ROOM –
REACTOR SHAFT
"The shaft is noisy with wind. Then, the wind stops and all that can be"
heard is the echoing footsteps of the Dark Lord. A haggard Luke is
"dangling over the abyss, struggling to climb back on to the gantry"
before Vader arrives. He still holds his light saber as he hoists himself
back onto the metal walkway.
"Vader brings his sword down before Luke can stand, but the young"
Jedi manages to block the blow. He scrambles backwards down the
"ramp, with Vader following, slashing at the youth. In the distance, the"
"muted roar of the wind blast can be heard getting ever closer, until"
the two warriors are engulfed in blast of wind that almost knocks them
off the gantry. Luke manages to stand in the wind and return Vader’s
powerful blows. The two battle furiously along the gantry. Vader cuts
away part of the railing that Luke is holding. Luke notices with awe as
the railing is lifted by the wind. He lets go and the metal floats away.
The wind stops and the fighting becomes even more intense. The
deadly buzz of the laser swords reverberates through the vast power
shaft. An alarm sounds and the public address system inside the
control room crackles.
ADDRESS SYSTEM Fugitives heading for transport Platform
Southwest-One. Secure all transport.
"VADER Your friends may escape, but you are doomed."
LUKE Not yet.
"Luke slashes at Vader again, renewing the fight. Luke’s sword"
"whistles past Vader and the young warrior is thrown off balance, his"
guard down. Vader’s light saber flashes out with deadly skill and cuts
"Luke, almost forcing him over the edge. He can barely stand. He"
"wipes the tears from his eyes, but still can barely focus on his"
massive opponent. 399. INT CORRIDOR LEADING TO LANDING
PLATFORM – BESPIN
The Millennium Falcon can be seen for a moment before the main
"door leading to the landing platform slams shut. Leia, Lando, Chewie"
and the droids round a corner. They duck into the alcove at the main
door just as Stormtroopers arrive at both ends of the hall and start
firing. The band of rebels squeeze into the little alcove as a rain of
laser bolts stream past and explode around them. Chewie blasts
away at the Stormtroopers. Leia punches buttons on the door’s
control panel.
LEIA We’ve got to find Luke.
LANDO His fate is sealed. You’ll be lucky to get out yourself. All
systems are on alert. everything’s locked.
THREEPIO Artoo! The control panel. You can override the alert
system.
Threepio points to a computer socket on the control panel. Little Artoo
beeps and scoots over to the panel and sticks his computer arm into
the socket.
ARTOO A short beep turns into a wild scream!
"Artoo’s circuits light up, his head spins around wildly and he begins to"
smoke. Lando pulls him away.
ARTOO (cooling away) Lets out a few wilted beeps.
"THREEPIO Well, next time you pay more attention. I’m not supposed"
"to know power sockets from computer feeds, I’m an interpreter…"
LEIA (firing at the Stormtroopers) Anybody else got any ideas? 400.
INT GANTRY OUTSIDE CONTROL ROOM – REACTOR SHAFT –
BESPIN
The guard rail has been cut to ribbons. Luke has been driven to the
edge of the jutting platform; he is ready to collapse under Vader’s
powerful blows. A continual rain of sparks showers down on the
young warrior from a severed power cable on the instrument stand.
The noise of clashing laser swords is now covered by the roar of wind
working its way up the shaft. Luke almost loses his balance and goes
"over the edge, but the wind props him up enough for him to regain his"
"balance. He attacks Vader again, with a vengeance, using his last"
reserves of strength. The wind fades away again.
VADER The Force runs strong in the Skywalker line. You will achieve
"great power… Come, join with me! Together we will be the most"
powerful… even stronger than The Emperor.
(INSERT B – DIALOGUE ADDED HERE)
LUKE No!… Never…
"Luke starts backing away from Vader, his strength gone at last."
VADER There is no escape. You must join me or die. Don’t make me
destroy you here… The Emperor is strong with The Force. But if you
"join me, together we could overthrow Him. Do not resist. It is our"
destiny!
LUKE Never.
"Luke lunges for Vader with his laser sword, but misses. He stumbles"
"to the other side of the platform. In the distance, the wind can be"
"heard working its way up the long shaft. Luke is out of breath,"
"exhausted, bleeding. He hears the wind rising and gives Vader a"
"long, hard look."
LUKE Never!
Luke staggers to the edge of the platform and jumps off into the
endless abyss. Vader rages in disbelief.
VADER No! The Dark Lord looks over the platform and sees Luke
falling far below. The wind begins to blow at Vader’s cape and the
"torrent finally forces him back, away from the edge. He looks out and"
sees Luke floating upward past him with the force of the wind.
"Spread-eagle, skydiver-style, Luke attempts to maneuver himself"
closer to the side of the shaft. He has hooked his laser sword to his
belt. The wind begins to fade and the wounded Jedi begins to fall
"fast, unable to grab onto anything. 401. INT – SHAFT – SMALL"

The Rebellion is doomed. Spies loyal to the Old Republic have
reported several new armored space stations under construction by
the Empire.
A desperate plan to attack the Dreaded Imperial capitol of Had
Abbadon and destroy the Death Stars before they are completed
has been put into effect.
"Rebel commandos, led by Princess Leia, have made their way into"
the very heart of the Galactic Empire: as the first step toward the final
battle for freedom….
"Pan down to reveal the planet HAD ABBADON, capitol of the"
Galactic Empire. The gray planet’s surface is completely covered with
cities and is shrouded in a sickly brown haze. Orbiting the polluted
"planet is a small, green, moon, a sparkling contrast to the foreboding"
sphere beyond.
"A large IMPERIAL TRANSPORT glides into frame. WE follow it, as it"
rockets toward the Imperial capitol. Four small TIE FIGHTERS escort
the larger craft. The web-like structures of two Death Stars under
construction loom in the distance as the transport approaches.
Resting to one side of the half completed space station is Darth
Vader’s super STAR DESTROYER and several ships of the Imperial
fleet. One of the TIE Fighters escorting the Imperial transport begins
to wobble and drops back with its engine sputtering.

sitting above and behind them.

"LEIA. All eyes on the bridge are on her. She thinks for a moment,"
then makes a decision.

their tracking screens as the ominous sounds of Lord Vader’s boots
echo throughout the bridge. The controllers watch in fear as the dark
Lord’s feet pass above them. One of the controllers goes back to his
work and spots the transport on his screen. A red light starts flashing
and a muted buzzer sounds. The controller speaks into his com-link.
"CONTROLLER Transport TYDIRIUM, you’re moving out of your flight"
path. Correct immediately.
VOICE OF REBEL PILOT One of our escort fighters has lost power.
We’re maneuvering for a tow.
An Imperial Officer moves in behind the Controller and switches off
the alarm and light.
OFFICER Check their security clearance.
"IMPERIAL CONTROLLER Transport Tydirium, identify and confirm"
your security status.
5. INT. IMPERIAL TRANSPORT COCKPIT The Pilot and Co-Pilot
look back to Leia with worried looks on their faces as the Imperial
Controller repeats his request.
LEIA Now we find out if that security code was worth the price we
paid. Send the transmission.
The Pilot flips several switches and a high-speed transmission is
heard. The Co-Pilot is very nervous.
CO-PILOT What if they changed the code? We don’t know how old
this one is.
"PILOT Just relax son, we’re not in trouble yet. Activate the tractor"
beam and lock onto Wedge’s fighter.
The Co-Pilot goes back to his controller. Leia and the Pilot exchange
concerned looks.
"CO-PILOT We have Wedge in tow, sir."
PILOT Reset your course for the sanctuary moon. Go around Vader’s
fleet the long way. We shouldn’t get too close.
An Imperial voice on the com-link breaks in.
"IMPERIAL CONTROLLER Transport Tydirium, bring your craft closer"
to the fleet for a visual check.
A new sense of foreboding sweeps through the cockpit.
PILOT They’re on to us…
CO-PILOT The code’s no good. Abort the mission.
LEIA No! We have to play this one out. Answer them.
PILOT Request acknowledged. We’re swinging closer.
The old Pilot switches off the com-link and looks over to the Co-Pilot
"who is scared to death, then over to Leia who is lost in thought."
PILOT It smells like a trap. Are you sure we shouldn’t abort the
mission?
LEIA No…but our fleet will surely be cut to ribbons if we aren’t set up
on the moon sanctuary before they arrive. You’d better warn the men.
6. INT. HOLD IMPERIAL TRANSPORT The hold of the transport is
filled with Rebel Commandos and massive equipment. A red light
goes on as the Pilot’s voice comes over the com-link.
PILOT We are approaching Lord Vader’s fleet for a visual security
check. Be on your best Imperial behavior.
"The troops start picking up their weapons, and quickly stow any non-"
Imperial equipment.
7. INT. COCKPIT IMPERIAL TRANSPORT Out the cockpit window
Vader’s super Star Destroyer grows larger as the Rebels approach it.
CO-PILOT We’re within range of their visual scanners.
PILOT Don’t go in any closer. Watch for approaching fighters.
The old Pilot turns and sees that Leia is overcome with melancholy.
Her head is resting in her hands. The old Pilot moves over to the
young Princess to comfort her. She looks up at him and wipes the
"tears from her eyes, as he puts his hand on her shoulder."
PILOT It’s all right. We’ve been in tougher scrapes than this. We’ll get
through.
LEIA I know…. I just wish Han were here.
PILOT These are the moments that we all miss Captain Solo….
She forces a weak little smile.
PILOT (continued) A small bet. Commander Skywalker will have him
back in time for the main attack.
"LEIA Lando’s signal only meant they’ve found Han alive, not how"
difficult it will be to free him.
"The com-link cracks to life, causing everyone to jump. The Pilot"
rushes back to his controls.
"IMPERIAL VOICE What is your cargo, Transport Tydirium?"
8. INT. BRIDGE VADER’S SUPER STAR DESTROYER The Imperial
Officer leans closer to the view screen; which flashes a series of x-ray
images of the interior of the transport. The controller repeats his
question.
IMPERIAL CONTROLLER Do you copy? What is your cargo?
PILOT VOICE Equipment and construction personnel for the
sanctuary moon…
The officer is called over to another view screen.
SECOND CONTROLLER The shuttle is approaching. High speed on
course 973.
OFFICER Alert all Commands. I’ll inform Lord Vader….
He turns back to the first controller.
"OFFICER (continued) Record your scan of the transport, we’ll go"
over it later.
IMPERIAL CONTROLLER Transport Tydirium….
9. INT. COCKPIT IMPERIAL TRANSPORT Tension is high in the
cockpit of the transport as they await their fate.
IMPERIAL CONTROLLER (continued) …. Stand by.
They look out the cockpit window at Vader’s super Star Destroyer
which looms before them. Suddenly the control panel lights up and
alarms go off.
CO-PILOT Imperial fighter…. moving up fast behind us!
Leia speaks into the com-link.
LEIA All units prepare for a boarding party.
PILOT Stand by to activate shields.
"LEIA Wait, it’s not slowing."
PILOT And it’s not firing either.
CO-PILOT It’s going to pass us.
The com-link sparks to life.
Outside the cockpit window an Imperial shuttle roars past them
heading for Vader’s ship.
LEIA Those are royal markings on that shuttle. Somebody important
is in a big hurry to see Lord Vader.
IMPERIAL CONTROLLER Transport Tydirium you are cleared to
proceed to the moon sanctuary.
There is a big sigh of relief from Leia and the Pilots.
CO-PILOT We made it. The code works.
PILOT I still don’t like it. Change to course 339. We’ll go the long way
around.
Leia and the Pilots watch the shuttle recede in the distance.
CO-PILOT Nothing can stop us now!
10. EXT. SPACE – TRANSPORT AND SHUTTLE The huge Imperial
Transport veers away from Vader’s super Star Destroyer and heads
for the distant sanctuary moon. The Imperial shuttle continues
towards Vader’s ship until it finally disappears into the main docking
bay on top of the huge Star Destroyer.
11. INT. MAIN BAY Super Star Destroyer As the shuttle settles onto
"the deck of the docking bay, Imperial ground crews rush about"
securing the craft. The bay is filled with an impressive formation of
"Stormtroopers, Guards, Star Captains, and Special Elite Units. As"
"one, the thousands of troops snap to attention, and heads turn to the"
entrance of the bay. The door slides open revealing the dark Lord of
"the Sith, DARTH VADER. He walks past the troops toward the shuttle"
craft. ADMIRAL PIETT and several Star Captains are with him. The
Admiral turns to Vader.
PIETT Never before have I heard of the GRAND MOFF leaving the
"planet to greet someone. You are greatly respected, my Lord."
VADER Or greatly feared. The disgusting little bureaucrat is
attempting to lay a trap for me.
PIETT He’s a fool to think that you would not know.
VADER The Emperor’s counsel is no fool. He is very clever and quite
dangerous.
Vader and Piett stop before the Imperial shuttle. The hatch to the
shuttle swings down and a colorful platoon of the Imperial Guards
"lines up outside the ramp. They salute as a thin, evil-looking man"
descends from the shuttle. He is the GRAND MOFF JERJERROD.
"Vader salutes him, but Admiral Piett and all the Star Captains kneel"
"before him. An effete covey of dignitaries descend the ramp, acting"
as if they have never been on a Starship before.
"VADER You honor me with your presence, My Lord."
"JERJERROD Yes, I know. (looking around) You may rise. All this"
"fuss just for me, an impressive display I must say. (sniffs the air) Yes,"
well the Emperor sends you his blessing….
VADER But he still refuses to answer my transmissions.
JERJERROD I’m afraid he’s quite too busy.
VADER Then why was I ordered to return?
JERJERROD He feels your prolonged stay in the outer systems has
not agreed with you.
Vader is very angry and it takes all the control he can muster to
contain himself. Jerjerrod starts for the hanger entrance. Vader
follows.
VADER Don’t you toy with me.
JERJERROD All right then…. the Emperor is disturbed with your
failure to deal with young Skywalker and he has decided to handle
the matter personally. You will supervise the construction of the Battle
Stations; a task he feels will be much less demanding.
"VADER But, I have all but turned him to the dark side of the force."
JERJERROD The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal
"of the situation. Skywalker is more powerful now, than before your"
feeble attempts to convert him.
"12. INT. BRIDGE STAR DESTROYER Vader, Jerjerrod and company"
walk onto the vast Star Destroyer bridge.
VADER He can’t do this. The boy is mine!
JERJERROD That seems to be part of the problem. It would appear
that you still have some feelings for your troublesome offspring.
VADER The only feeling I have for him is hatred.
JERJERROD Then you should be thankful the Emperor has taken
such an interest in him. The Emperor will turn Skywalker to the dark
"side, and then destroy the Rebellion in one swift stroke."
"VADER The Rebellion will not be easily crushed, and my son will not"
be easily turned.
"JERJERROD The Emperor will succeed, where you have failed. You"
"are weak Lord Vader, more machine than man. The Emperor’s plan"
has already been put into motion. The entire rebel force is on its way
"to us, for one last, hopeless confrontation, so I suggest you prepare"
your fleet.
VADER My son would not be so foolish as to fall into such a trap.
"JERJERROD Ahh but, he is not with them. Your son is on his home"
"planet of Tatooine. He will soon be in our hands, and the Emperor will"
have his way with him.
VADER Get off my bridge!
JERJERROD As you wish…
The Grand Moff turns and walks off the bridge followed by the
dignitaries. The Admiral and his Captains go back to their duties.
Vader stand alone on the bridge looking out across the vast sea of
stars.
"VADER (to himself) Luke, beware, you are the Emperor’s prey now."
DISSOLVE TO
13. INT. TATOOINE INN
"[""In the rough draft Luke is asleep and struggling with thoughts of"
Vader and the dark side. Yoda and Ben are also present in the
"dream, and Luke berates Ben for not telling him that Vader is his"
father. Yoda explains that he'll soon be joining Ben in the
"Netherworld, and therefore he'll become stronger and will be better"
"able to help Luke. Vader's voice reappears, and Luke awakens."" -L."
"Bouzerau, explanation from Star Wars The Annotated Screenplays"
page 241.]
"Luke snaps awake from a sound sleep, his head still ringing with"
Vader’s words. It takes a moment for him to focus on his
"surroundings. He is in a small rundown, tavern. Two vile, little dirty"
"Jawas; ATETU and TWEETU, stare at him from across the room."
They shake their cloak-covered heads and go back to cooking an
odorous stew.
The howling wind outside blows the door open with a loud crash.
"Luke reaches for his pistol, the Jawas hide. Out of the dust cloud"
"emerge two familiar shapes, SEE THREEPIO and ARTOO DETOO."
"Luke relaxes as the angry Jawas come out of hiding, scolding the"
robots for not closing the door. Atetu waddles to the door and strains
against the wind to close it.
"THREEPIO Master Luke, I beg you not to send us out in weather like"
that again…it’s unbearable out there.
Artoo whistles his agreement.
LUKE Were you able to get everything I asked for?
"THREEPIO An impossible task, but yes we have all of it….Artoo?"
Artoo beeps and one of his tiny arms pokes out of its hatch carrying a
small box. The door to the hovel bangs open again giving everyone a
"start, including R-2 who drops the box of parts. Out of the cloud of"
dust comes LANDO and CHEWIE. Atetu is very angry and starts
yelling at Lando and Chewie. The little Jawa storms over to Chewie
"and screams at the Wookiee (in his gibberish language), shaking his"
"fist. Chewie stares at him blankly, then shrugs and closes the door."
"Atetu continues to vent his anger on Luke, then waddles back to his"
cooking.
"LANDO Next time I’ll try to get us better accommodations, but"
trustworthy innkeepers are hard to come by around here.
Chewie barks and puts several small parts before Luke.
LUKE What did you find out?
LANDO He survived the unfreezing process but I couldn’t get any
"report on his condition; but we’re going to have to hurry, the"
execution has been set for tomorrow.
Threepio picks up a small micro chip.
"THREEPIO Master Luke, I beg your pardon, but how can these micro"
parts help rescue Capt. Solo?
Luke holds up an odd looking box.
"LUKE When it’s finished it will be our ticket into the palace. But first,"
we must send this JABBA the HUTT a message. That’s where you
two can help.
THREEPIO At your service.
Tweetu calls out and points to the bowls of steaming food on the
table. Chewie barks and heads for the table followed by Lando.
"LANDO Better get something to eat, Luke, we may not get another"
chance.
"LUKE You go ahead, I still have some things to do first. (motions to"
"R-2) Come over here, Artoo."
Threepio follows Chewie to the table and asks Tweetu something.
The creature answers and goes to a cupboard. Threepio sits at the
table. On the far side of the room Luke stands before Artoo and
recites a message. A beam of light from Artoo passes over him as he
"speaks. Tweetu brings Threepio an oil can, and Threepio starts oiling"
his joints.
THREEPIO A few more trips outside and I’ll surely short circuit.
Chewie barks and Lando passes him some food.
LANDO It’s a miracle that Han survived the unfreezing process. I just
hope he’s still in one piece.
Chewie barks his agreement. Luke and R-2 come over to the others.
R-2 begins to beep at 3PO.
THREEPIO We have to leave?!? What are you talking about? I’m not
going out in that storm again!
"LUKE 3PO, I need you to go with him to the palace."
THREEPIO Palace?!?
LUKE He’s going to need your help.
THREEPIO Help!?!
Artoo beeps at Threepio again.
"THREEPIO All right, I’m coming. I’m coming. I was afraid of this."
"Master Luke, are you sure…"
LUKE Threepio…. I’m depending on you.
"THREEPIO Yes, Master Luke."
Artoo and Threepio leave the Inn as the wind howls madly outside.
Luke grabs some food off of the table and goes back to his work.
LANDO What makes you think those droids will ever get in to see
Jabba – let alone deliver the message.
LUKE Greed. It’s Jabba’s weakness. With this phony spice extractor
"and his greed, we’ll make contact with Han as soon as I finish. You"
and Chewie are going to have to make the next visit to the palace.
LANDO You mean just walk right in?? They’ll kill us.
"LUKE Not when you present Jabba with this little gem, and tell him"
we have a hundred more just like it. You’ll be all right.
LANDO But we don’t have another hundred just like it. I think this
plan of yours leaves a lot to be desired.
"LUKE Listen, Lando, you know we couldn’t get Han out of that"
stronghold even if we had an army with us. Our only hope is to get
"Jabba to take him out of there, for us…."
LANDO Then what?
LUKE Then you leave the rest to me.
Lando shakes his head in disbelief.
LANDO I sure hope you know what you’re doing.
"Chewie concurs, as Luke goes back to working on his gift."
14. EXT. ROAD TO PALACE – GATE The wind has died down
"somewhat, but a fair amount of sand still flows around the two droids"
as they struggle along the path to the ominous palace of Jabba the
Hutt. R-2 whistles a worried sigh.
THREEPIO Why are droids always given the dirty work?….
Sometimes I wonder why we put up with it all.
Artoo beeps his agreement as they reach the main gate to the
Palace. It is closed. Threepio looks around for some kind of signaling
"device, then he timidly knocks on the giant iron door. A small hatch in"
"the middle of the door snaps open and a spidery mechanical arm,"
"with a large electronic eyeball on the end, pops out and inspects the"
two droids.
STRANGE VOICE Tee chuta what zudd!
"Threepio points to R-2, then to himself."
THREEPIO Artoo Detoowha bo Seethreeiowha ey toota odd mischka
Jabba du Hutt.
"The eye looks from one robot to the other, then zips back into the"
"door, and the hatch slams shut. Artoo beeps his concern."
"THREEPIO I don’t think they’re going to let us in, Artoo, maybe we"
should go.
"Artoo agrees, and the droids turn to leave. Suddenly, the massive"
door starts to rise with an ominous thumping and horrific metallic
screech. The robots turn back toward an endless black cavity which
"has been revealed beyond the door. The robots look at one another,"
afraid to go inside.
STRANGE VOICE Nudd chaa!
Artoo starts forward into the black void.
"THREEPIO Artoo, maybe we should reconsider the…. Artoo wait!"
The bronze droid rushes after his stubby companion. The noisy door
begins to lower behind them.
15. INT. JABBA’S PALACE – HALLWAY The door slams shut with a
loud crash that echoes throughout the dark passageway. The
"frightened robots are met by two giant green scaly GUARDS, who fall"
in behind them. Artoo beeps a weak question. Threepio quickly
glances around and looks at the two lumbering lizard-like guards
"behind him, then turns back to Artoo. The guard grunts an order."
THREEPIO You don’t want to know. Just deliver Master Luke’s
message and get us out of here quick.
Walking toward them out of the darkness is a wizened old man
"dressed in a dark cloak and tall hat. This is the High Beeser of Hutt,"
BIB FORTUNA.
"BIB I am Bib Fortuna, the High Beeser of Hutt. What brings you to our"
domain?
"THREEPIO We bring a message to your master, Jabba the Hutt."
Artoo lets out a series of quick beeps.
"THREEPIO ….and a gift. (thinks a moment then to R-2) Gift, what"
gift?
"BIB Jabba cannot be disturbed, I will take the gift for him."
"He holds out his hand toward R-2 and the tiny droid backs up a bit,"
letting out an array of squeaks and tones.
THREEPIO Artoo give it to him!
Artoo defiantly whistles a blue streak. 3PO turns to the Beeser.
THREEPIO He says our master’s instructions are to give it only to
Jabba the Hutt himself.
Bib thinks about this for a moment.
THREEPIO I’m terribly sorry. I’m afraid he’s ever so stubborn about
these things.
"BIB Very well then, follow me."
They troop in behind the Grand Beeser and follow him into the
darkness.
"THREEPIO Artoo, I have a very bad feeling about this."
16. INT. MAIN PALACE CHAMBER The main chamber in the palace
"is filled with the most grotesque, and vile CREATURES ever"
conceived in the universe. Artoo and Threepio stand very small in the
doorway to the dimly lit chamber.
THREEPIO We’re doomed!
Light shafts partially illuminate the drunken courtiers as Bib Fortuna
crosses the room to the leader of this disgusting crowd: JABBA THE
HUTT. This Godfather of the galactic crime world is a repulsively fat
sultan-like monster with a maniacal grin. Bib whispers something in
"this slobbering degenerate’s ear. Jabba laughs, and motions to the"
two terrified droids. He speaks in a strange language to the Grand
Beeser.
JABBA (in Huttese) This gift had better be worth it.
The robots reluctantly come forward to stand before this looseskinned
villain.
JABBA (in Huttese) Speak!
"THREEPIO (in English) The message Artoo, the message."
"Artoo whistles and a beam of light projects from his domed head,"
creating a HOLOGRAM of Luke on the floor. The image grows to
"over ten feet tall, and the young Jedi towers over the space"
gangsters. Threepio translates.
"LUKE Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am"
"Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend of the one called Solo. I wish"
an audience to bargain for his life…. (all laugh) I have objects of great
value from Durell System (the crowd mumbles) and as a token of my
"goodwill, I present to you a gift, these two droids…."
Threepio is startled by this announcement.
THREEPIO (in English) What?!? What did he say?
LUKE Both are hard working and will serve you well…I will soon send
my agents for your reply.
"THREEPIO (in English) Oh no, this can’t be. Artoo you must have"
played the wrong tape….
"JABBA (laughs in Huttese) There will be no bargain, but I will take the"
droids with pleasure.
He motions for the guards to take the droids away.
"BIB (in Huttese) Bargain rather than fight? He’s no Jedi, he’s an"
imposter.
Jabba concurs and the loathsome courtiers laugh at his response.
17. DUNGEON HALLWAY Artoo and Threepio are led down a dark
and dank dungeon passageway lined with holding cells. The cries of
"unspeakable creatures bounce off the cold stone walls, and"
"occasionally a horrible looking arm, or tentacle grabs through the"
bars at the two hapless droids.
THREEPIO What could have come over Master Luke? Is it something
we did? He never expressed to me any unhappiness with our work.
They stop at a door at the end of the hall.
18. INT. BOILER ROOM The door slides open revealing a room filled
with steam and noisy machinery. The menacing guard motions them
"into the boiler room where they are met by a tall, thin, human-like"
"ROBOT named U-8d8 (Eue-Atedeate). The guard grunts to the droid,"
who is sitting behind a high desk.
"ATEDEATE Ah, new acquisitions. I am Eue Atedeate, chief of Cyborg"
"Operations. You’re a protocol droid, aren’t you?"
"THREEPIO I am See Threepio, Human…."
ATEDEATE Yes or no will do.
"THREEPIO Well, yes."
ATEDEATE How many languages do you speak?
"THREEPIO I am fluent in over six million forms of communication,"
and can….
ATEDEATE Wonderful! We have been without an interpreter since
the Master got angry and disintegrated out last protocol droid.
THREEPIO Disintegrated??
Atedeate turns to the thick-headed guard.
"ATEDEATE This one will be quite useful, fit him with a restraining"
"bolt, then take him back to the main audience chamber."
"THREEPIO No wait, Artoo don’t leave me…."
The guard pushes Threepio out of the room. Artoo lets out a plaintive
"cry, as the door closes. He then beeps a blue streak to the operations"
droid.
"ATEDEATE So you’d rather not get stuck cleaning the prison cells,"
"huh. Oh, you’re good at dispensing beverages, are you?"
He throws some hoses and mop-like extensions at Artoo.
ATEDEATE (Continued) You’ll do clean up! Follow me.
"Disappointed, Artoo clutches the apparatus and falls in behind the"
taller droid.
19. MAIN PALACE CHAMBER The court of Jabba the Hutt is a
"drunken, raucous assembly. TWO GUARDS bring in a weathered old"
"STAR CAPTAIN, who stands angrily before the slimy rogue."
"CAPTAIN Listen Jabba, I’m tired of waiting…."
JABBA (in Huttese) Bring forth my new protocol droid.
"Everyone near him looks around, and finally Threepio is shoved"
forward. Jabba motions to the golden droid to come nearer.
JABBA (in Huttese) What is he saying?
"THREEPIO (in Huttese) He is tired of waiting, Your Excellency."
"Jabba jabbers away at Threepio with a chuckle, the interpreter droid"
turns to the Star Captain.
THREEPIO (in English) His Excellency finds your impatience irritating
and has decided not to pay you at all….
CAPTAIN (puts hand on gun) You tell that swollen scumbag he’d
better cough up my fee or they’ll be picking his hide out of every
crack in this room.
"Threepio looks at Jabba, then back to the Star Captain, then back to"
Jabba. He hesitates to translate this unpleasant message.
"THREEPIO (in Huttese) Your Grandness, he feels he would not be"
happy with that arrangement.
"Jabba sits with growing anger and 3PO backs away, then the"
gangster starts to laugh.
JABBA Boscka!
"The Star Captain goes for his gun, but before he can draw, a trap"
door in the floor springs open and swallows him up. The door snaps
"shut. A rumble is heard, then muffled growls and a hideous scream."
Jabba and the court laugh hysterically. Threepio looks up and is
"terrified to see his old friend Chewbacca, and Lando entering the"
room followed by two guards.
THREEPIO (in English) Oh no!
Lando and the giant Wookiee stand over the trap door as they greet
"Jabba the Hutt. Chewie barks, Threepio translates."
"THREEPIO (in Huttese) He greets you and wishes you good health,"
Your Excellency….
"Jabba waves at Chewie, and chuckles as he speaks to the Wookiee."
"THREEPIO (in English) His Excellency is surprised to see you here,"
"Chewbacca, and quite frankly so am I, you’re in grave danger."
"LANDO We bring you a gift, Exalted One, and more to follow if you"
accept Skywalker’s bargain.
Threepio repeats this to his gluttonous master as a Jawa scurries
"over to Lando, takes the device Luke has constructed and delivers it"
"to Jabba, who inspects it."
JABBA (in Huttese) A Durellian spice extractor…. Ask him how
many?
"THREEPIO (in English) He would like to know if you have any more,"
you are standing over a trap door.
"LANDO Two hundred, a rare load, and a more than adequate ransom"
for Captain Solo.
"Threepio repeats this to Jabba, who laughs and rubs his hands in"
glee.
JABBA (in Huttese) Agreed.
THREEPIO (in English) He has agreed to your ….
JABBA (in Huttese) Seize them!
"Jabba signals his guards, who instantly grab Chewie and Lando"
securing their hands behind them.
"JABBA (in Huttese) Now you will join your beloved Captain, and I will"
demand twice the ransom.
THREEPIO We’re doomed.
"LANDO But, we must tell him your reply! If we don’t return, Skywalker"
will not deliver the goods.
"Threepio repeats this to Jabba, who answers with a boisterous laugh."
"JABBA (in Huttese) If he fails to arrive, you will fail to survive."
THREEPIO He doesn’t care.
"LANDO What?! You can’t do this! Jabba, think of all the wealth you’re"
throwing away….
Lando and the Wookiee are led away amid laughter and jeers.
Jabba’s goblet is refilled and he commands the entertainment to
begin. Several GIRLS emerge from the crowd and start to dance.
20. DUNGEON HALLWAY AND CELL Lando and Chewie are led
"down the row of cells, passing Artoo pushing a broom. Chewie barks"
at his little friend and the stubby droid starts whistling madly. One of
the guards pulls a controller from his belt and zaps Artoo with it. The
little robot jumps and lets out a scream. A cell door opens and the two
prisoners are thrown inside. The door bangs closed as Chewie smells
someone else is in the cell with them. The giant Wookiee lets out a
crazy yell and races toward a shadowed figure in the corner. He
grabs the figure and gives him a big hug that carries them into the
"light revealing Chewie’s old partner, a bearded HAN SOLO."
"HAN All right, all right, wait a second, you’re crushing me!"
Chewie lets go and Han scratches the Wookiee’s chest and sees
Lando.
HAN Lando! I’m gonna kill you.
He starts to take a swing at his old friend when Chewie comes
between them holding Han back. The Wookiee growls and yips an
explanation. Han relaxes.
HAN You rescued Chewie and Leia?
LANDO …. and now I’m here to rescue you….
"HAN Well, you’re doing great so far."
LANDO Luke’s plan seems to have backfired.
HAN Luke? He’s here too?
LANDO He will be soon enough…. He’s gonna try to pay off Jabba
with some phony spice extractor that he doesn’t have.
HAN Is he crazy?
Chewie barks yes!
"HAN That kid can’t even take care of himself, let alone rescue us."
LANDO He seems awfully sure of himself.
"21. EXT. ROAD TO PALACE GATE Luke, dressed in a black shirt"
"and pants, walks down the dusty road toward the palace gate. He"
"carries no pistol, and no lasersword. He stands before the gate and"
the little eye gives him the once over.
"LUKE Open the gate, I am expected…."
The gate creaks open and Luke enters.
22. INT. JABBA’S PALACE HALLWAY Two giant guards fall in
behind Luke as he strides down the long hallway. Bib Fortuna
appears out of the darkness and greets the young Jedi. Several other
guards surround them in the darkness.
BIB His Excellency holds your agents as well as Capt. Solo. You
"must bring double the ransom you offered, and then Jabba will"
bargain.
"LUKE (in Huttese) I would speak to Jabba, now!"
BIB He will not see you. First you must bring the ransom.
Luke looks around at the guards and then back to Bib.
LUKE The ransom is unimportant.
BIB The ransom is unimportant.
"LUKE You will take me to Jabba, now!"
"BIB I will take you to Jabba, now."
LUKE The guards will stay here.
"BIB (in Huttese) Guards, stay here."
LUKE You will show me the way.
BIB I will show you the way.
Bib turns and Luke follows him into the darkness leaving the
somewhat puzzled guards behind scratching their heads.
23. MAIN PALACE CHAMBER The loud and boisterous court of
Jabba the Hutt suddenly goes quiet as Luke and Bib Fortuna enter
the large chamber. Bib leans over to Jabba’s ear and whispers
something. Jabba becomes upset and Bib backs away as the
gangster yells.
JABBA (in Huttese) Throw him out. He must bring the extractors first.
"The guards start for Luke, and he glares at them and they stop."
Threepio edges his way through the crowds to see Luke.
THREEPIO Master Luke!
"LUKE I must be allowed to speak, now."
BIB He must be allowed to speak now.
"He returns and whispers this to Jabba, who becomes furious and"
"clobbers Bib, sending him crashing to the floor."
JABBA (in Huttese) You weak-minded alien fool! He’s using an old
Jedi mind trick.
LUKE (in Huttese) You will bring Capt. Solo to me.
"JABBA (in Huttese) Young Jedi, I am not affected by Human thought."
"I’m afraid your mind powers will not work with me, boy. I have killed"
many Jedi Knights in my time….
Threepio notices that Luke is standing over the trap door and
frantically motions him to move to one side.
"THREEPIO Master Luke. He’s going to kill you, move away…. you’re"
standing on a….
A MONSTER turns around and growls at Threepio and he quickly
shuts up and backs away.
JABBA I shall enjoy watching you die….
"Luke reaches out his hand, and a pistol jumps out of one of the"
"guards’ holsters, flying magically into Luke’s hand. The bewildered"
guard grabs for it.
JABBA Boscka!
"The floor suddenly drops away, sending Luke and the guard into the"
pit. Jabba laughs and the court joins in.
24. INT. RANCOR PIT Luke manages to get to his feet. The guard is
yelling for help. The young Jedi looks up to see a crowd gathering
around the edge of the pit and a metal gate slams closed above him.
A second door in the side of the pit starts to rumble open. The guard
panics and starts to scream. Luke calmly looks around for a means to
escape. Out of the side passage emerges a giant brown fanged
RANCOR. The guard finds his pistol and starts firing at the hideous
"beast; which only seems to make it more furious, as it comes at the"
two men.
"In a sudden burst of energy, Luke jumps twenty feet straight up and"
"grabs on to the overhead grate. The crowd is at first startled, and"
"then starts booing at Luke, as he makes his way hand over hand to"
"the side wall, where he wedges himself into a corner. As the guard"
"continues to fire at the monster, it picks up the unfortunate man and"
"pops him into its slavering jaws. A few screams, and the guard has"
been swallowed. The audience’s cheers turn to jeers as Luke
struggles to maintain his grip. His foot slips and he dangles helplessly
over the howling beast.
25. INT. MAIN CHAMBER – PALACE Two filthy little Jawas run over
to the grate and mash Luke’s fingers with the butts of their laser rifles.
Luke struggles to hang on. He is unable to brace himself against the
wall.
"26. INT. RANCOR PIT The Rancor paws at Luke, but is unable to"
"reach him. Finally, the Jawas are successful and Luke drops from the"
"grate. The young Jedi lands in the eye of the monster, then tumbles"
"to the floor of the pit. The Rancor bellows in pain, stamping around in"
circles holding his face. Luke runs behind the raging creature and
"scurries into the holding tunnel. Unfortunately, it’s a dead end, and he"
turns to see the monster approaching him. Luke notices a door
mechanism about half way down the wall. He picks up a stone and
hurtles it at the controls. A split second before the Rancor reaches
"Luke, the overhead door comes crashing down on the beast’s head,"
squashing it like a sledgehammer on an egg – Luke tries to catch his
breath.
27. INT. MAIN CHAMBER – PALACE A startled gasp is heard from
"the stunned court as all heads turn to Jabba, who is turning red with"
anger.
JABBA (in Huttese) Get him out of there…. and bring Solo and his
friends! They will all suffer for this outrage.
The Rancor KEEPERS are the first ones into the pit followed by
several guards. The keepers check the dead Rancor. One of the
keepers breaks down and starts sobbing. He is comforted by the
other keepers.
"28. INT. DUNGEON CELL Han, Chewie and Lando crowd around"
little R2-D2 who is projecting a small hologram of Luke.
LUKE ….when the time is right.
"HAN I don’t have much hope for this, but it’s the only chance we’ve"
got.
"LANDO Don’t worry, Luke will come through."
R-2 beeps as noises are heard at the cell door. R-2 quickly sticks out
his vacuum cleaner extension. The others assume casual positions
around the cell before the contingent of guards enters and yanks the
prisoners out leaving little R-2 alone to finish his cleaning.
"29. MAIN PALACE CHAMBER Han, Chewie, and Lando are shoved"
"into the main chamber, where they are forced to kneel before Jabba"
the Hutt. They are surprised to see Threepio standing behind the
grotesque gangster.
"JABBA (in Huttese) Han, my boy, I had intended for your final"
performance to be at the festival…. I must admit I’m surprised at the
company you keep….
THREEPIO He’s moving up your execution. He is quite upset at
Master Luke.
LANDO I told you! He’s got the old geezer scared to death.
HAN All he’s managed to do is speed up our funeral.
LANDO (to Jabba) Our friend is powerful. He will destroy you.
"Threepio repeats this to Jabba, who laughs."
"JABBA (in Huttese) Powerful, yes, but I doubt if he can destroy us."
"There is a commotion at the far end of the room, and Luke is"
"escorted through the crowd, and placed with the others. He is slightly"
beat up from his ordeal with the Rancor. He looks sheepishly at his
friends.
"HAN Good try old buddy. Stupid, but at least you tried."
"JABBA (in Huttese) I have a special treat for you, and your friends,"
Jedi. From this one you will not escape. Take them to the SARLACC
NEST.
"A loud cheer rises from the crowd, as they excitedly start to leave the"
room. Threepio’s interpretation of Jabba’s speech is drowned out by
the noise. Chewie and the others look around somewhat worried.
30. EXT. TATOOINE DUNE SEA The sandstorm has subsided
"somewhat, as a huge SAIL BARGE cruises across the vast dune sea"
about six feet above the sand surface. This is a large version of
Luke’s old anti-gravity landspeeder. Darting in and out among the
large craft are several smaller SKIFFS; which hold about twenty
people.
31. INT. MAIN SAIL BARGE Jabba the Hutt rides like a sultan in the
"massive anti-gravity ship. His entire retinue is with him, drinking and"
eating and having a great time. Threepio stands between two horrible
"CREATURES, translating their conversation. Both monsters speak in"
strange tongues. One of the beasts gets angry at something the other
"has said, and punches him in the face. Threepio takes this as a sign"
"to leave; which he does in haste, bumping into a smaller droid serving"
"drinks, spilling them all over the place. The stubby droid lets out an"
angry series of beeps and whistles. Threepio finally recognizes the
robot.
THREEPIO Artoo! What are you doing here?
Artoo beeps a quick reply.
"THREEPIO Of course, I see you’re serving drinks! But, this place is"
"dangerous, they’re going to execute Master Luke, and if we’re not"
"careful, us too!"
Artoo whistles a sing-song response.
THREEPIO I wish I had your confidence….
"A slimy beast bellows at Artoo, holding up his goblet. R-2 beeps a"
good-bye and scoots over to the thirsty creature.
"32. INT. SKIFF Han, Luke, Chewie and Lando sit in the small antigravity"
craft surrounded by armed guards.
HAN So much for your plan to get us out of the palace. Now we’re
really in for it.
LANDO The odds don’t look too good.
"LUKE Don’t worry, I’ll get us out of this."
HAN (sarcastic) Oh I’m sure.
LUKE Hey! I’ve learned a few things since I saw you last. Trust me
old buddy.
"HAN Pardon me, I forgot you’ve become a Jedi."
"Han gives a skeptical glance at Lando, who shrugs, then at Chewie,"
who barks. Luke closes his eyes and relaxes.
33. EXT. DUNE SEA – SARLACC PIT The hovering barge stops on
the side of a large sand pit. The smaller skiffs circle the rim of the
"deep cone of sand. The craft carrying Luke, Han, Lando and Chewie"
moves over the center of the pit and hovers. The prisoners look down
into the pit and see a disgusting mucus lined hole at the vortex of
sand. Around the edge of the cavity are thousands of needle sharp
"teeth and four thin, ten foot long feelers, that sweep across the sand"
looking for victims.
34. INT. SKIFF Chewie growls at the monster in the pit. Han and
Lando look at Luke with worried looks. The guards order the
"prisoners to stand, and they are lined up in the center of the small"
craft. A long gangplank is hoisted to the side of the hovering skiff.
35. INT. MAIN SAIL BARGE The crowd is getting drunk and
boisterous. A tall thin BRUTE pours the remains of his drink on
"Artoo’s head and demands a refill, which he is given by the little droid"
with a subservient beep. Jabba laughs hysterically as two beautiful
young GIRLS toss small fruits into his mouth. Bib Fortuna settles
down next to the Exalted One and motions to the skiff hovering over
the pit.
"BIB We are ready, Your Excellency."
"Jabba raises his arm, and the motley array of intergalactic pirates"
falls silent. Threepio is standing right behind him and he motions to
the robot.
JABBA Protocol droid!
"Threepio leans forward, right next to Jabba’s face and the slobbering"
villain mumbles something to him. Threepio steps forward to the rail
overlooking the pit and the small skiff.
"THREEPIO His Excellency hopes you will die honorably, but should"
"any of you wish to beg for mercy, the Exalted One will now listen to"
your pleas.
The prisoners look at each other and Han steps forward.
"HAN You can tell that slimy, worm-ridden filth, he will get no such"
pleasure from us.
"Threepio repeats this in Huttese to Jabba, who only laughs, and gives"
the thumbs down sign.
JABBA Put them in!
36. INT. SKIFF Two guards grab Luke and roughly lead him to the
"waiting gangplank. They release his magno-bonds, and force him to"
walk out over the pit by poking him with long electronic poles. A guard
timidly moves out on the gangplank to push Luke out to the end. The
young Jedi turns to face his companions and then salutes them.
"LUKE I guess this could have ended better. See yah, old buddy."
The guard prods him again and he jumps off the gangplank to the
cheers of the bloodthirsty spectators. Before anyone realizes what
"happened, Luke has used his Jedi training to spin around, grab onto"
"the end of the plank, and catapult himself up onto the deck with a"
double-back flip; which causes the startled guard to lose his balance
and fall into the pit.
Luke reaches out his hand and a blaster is pulled from the holster of
one of the guards and magically flips into his hand. Now things are
happening very fast. The hapless guard in the pit is eaten as a
"second guard draws his pistol, but is blasted by Luke before he can"
"fire. The rest of the guards go for their weapons, and chaos follows."
"Hands bound, Han, Chewie and Lando dive for cover. Luke grabs a"
bonding release device and activates it. The prisoners’ restraining
bonds fall away.
"The guards fire at Luke as he races to the control panel of the craft,"
but the guns are knocked out of their hands by Han and Lando.
Chewie grabs one of the guards and tosses him overboard into the
waiting jaws of the sarlacc. A fist fight ensues between prisoners and
guards. Two guards knock Luke away from the skiff controls and the
"hover craft begins to drift. Using his Jedi skills, Luke knocks the two"
"guards overboard, but one manages to grab onto a rail and dangles"
over the pit screaming. Luke is hit from behind by another guard and
knocked to the deck.
37. INT. MAIN SAIL BARGE Jabba and the spectators are startled at
the turn of events. Some of the creatures begin to laugh and yell at
the combatants. Jabba is amused. Bib is worried.
"BIB (in Huttese) Should I stop it, Your Excellency?"
"JABBA No wait, I find it amusing."
Guards take up positions along the gunnel of the barge as the fistfight
continues to rage on the small skiff. Threepio has backed away from
"the main group of spectators, hoping not to be noticed. He is startled"
"by Artoo, who comes up from behind, and lets out a loud hoot."
Threepio jumps and turns around.
THREEPIO Artoo! Don’t do that! What is it?
"Artoo lets out with a series of whistles and beeps, then takes off down"
the deck.
"THREEPIO You need my help? Wait, I don’t understand, what plan?"
Artoo?
Threepio follows his stubby companion into the hold of the barge.
"Three guards fight with Luke, and Han, Lando and Chewie fight the"
remaining three guards. The Captain of the Guard is beckoned over
to Jabba by Bib.
JABBA Shoot them.
"CAPTAIN Your Excellency, six of my guards are down there. It will"
difficult to get off a clear shot.
JABBA Shoot them all!
"CAPTAIN (distressed) Yes, Your Excellency."
"The Captain bows, and commands his men to fire at the skiff."
38. INT. SKIFF Laserbolts wizz past the combatants. The guard
"fighting with Chewie is hit by a blast, and the Wookiee is knocked to"
"the deck wounded. Another blast hits the controls of the skiff,"
"knocking out one of the stabilizers, causing the small craft to lurch"
"violently to one side thirty degrees, throwing Han, Luke and many of"
"the guards into the Sarlacc pit. Two of the guards, Lando, and the"
wounded Wookiee manage to hang on to the lopsided craft.
Laserbolts continue to bounce off the bottom of the skiff protecting
those still on board the craft. A guard who was hanging on the side
during the fight suddenly finds himself on top of the craft. He is able
to stand and wave frantically at the guards on the barge to stop firing.
The second guard struggles to pull himself up to the control panel.
Lando who is hanging on the top rail works his way along hand over
hand trying to get to the controls before the guard. Chewie is caught
between two seats and bellows in pain.
"39. EXT. SARLACC Han struggles to climb out of the pit, but only"
slides further down toward the fearsome sloth. He slides past Luke
"who is lying very still, spread eagle in the sand, facing the hole at the"
bottom.
"LUKE Han, lie still, don’t fight it."
HAN It’s easy for you to say.
Luke reaches out and grabs onto Han as he slides past him. Han’s
"momentum is stopped, both of them are pulled closer to the horrible"
"mouth. The guards struggle frantically, and are quickly eaten."
40. INT. CONTROL BRIDGE OF SAIL BARGE Artoo and Threepio
race into the small control room of the barge whistling and yelling.
THREEPIO (in Huttese) We’re under attack! They’re going to kill His
"Excellency. Help him, hurry!"
The BARGE CAPTAIN and his two PILOTS rush out of the bridge
and Artoo quickly closes the door behind them and locks it with a loud
click.
"THREEPIO This is a great plan, now we’re trapped."
Artoo beeps a rude response and goes to the control panel and starts
pushing a long row of red buttons. An alarm suddenly goes off.
THREEPIO You’ve just opened all the power connectors. You’re
going to blow us up!
Banging begins at the locked door as the crew responds to the
alarms.
41. INT. SKIFF Lando just barely makes it to the controls before the
"guard flips the switch that rights the ship, throwing the other guard"
"standing on its side, into the pit. Lando and the guard fight over the"
controls causing the ship to lurch. Chewie slides dangerously close to
"the open hatch, but with great pain manages to hold on."
42. INT. MAIN SAIL BARGE The guards who are firing at the skiff are
ordered away by their Captain.
"CAPTAIN (in Huttese) To the control bridge, quickly!"
"Jabba remains calm, but those around him begin to panic and some"
run. The muffled alarm sounds can be heard from the control bridge
as the huge barge begins to shudder.
43. SARLACC PIT Lando finally knocks the last guard into the pit and
takes control of the craft. Han and Luke slide closer to the jaws. One
of the sloth’s feelers wraps itself around Han’s leg and starts to pull
both warriors into its deadly mouth. Lando maneuvers the skiff down
toward his two friends and lowers a tow cable. Luke and Han try to
"grab the cable, but only slip closer to death. Lando moves the ship"
around for another try. Chewie lies unconscious in the back of the
craft.
44. INT. COMMAND BRIDGE The beating sounds are intense and
the door starts to give way. Artoo and 3PO stand on the control panel
in front of a window. Artoo beeps at Threepio as he hesitates at the
window.
THREEPIO I can’t do it….
Artoo beeps and bumps 3PO through the window. The golden robot
"shrieks as he falls to the sand below. R-2 jumps after him, just as the"
door explodes and several guards burst into the control bridge.
CAPTAIN Shut down those converters!
The guards race to the control panel.
45. SARLACC PIT – BARGE Han is almost touching the needle
sharp teeth as Lando moves the cable within reach a second time.
Luke grabs on to the cable and the two warriors are pulled from the
pit as the cable is slowly retracted.
Bib moves closer to his master and whispers into his ear.
"BIB Perhaps the deck gun would be helpful, Exalted One."
JABBA What are those alarms?
"BIB Not to worry, everything is under control."
JABBA Fire the deck guns!
The guards rush to several large deck guns mounted near the bow of
the barge.
Luke finally makes it to the deck of the skiff and helps Han on board.
A blast from the barge deck gun rocks the small craft almost knocking
Han overboard. He dangles from the side rail and is almost knocked
loose by a second blast which causes the ship to lean to one side.
Lando struggles to right the craft and get them out of there.
"LANDO We’re losing power, another direct hit and we’re finished."
The guards are zeroed in on the skiff when the Captain and his men
run out of the control bridge yelling.
CAPTAIN Abandon ship! Abandon ship.
"Before the guards can react, the entire barge blows up in a"
spectacular fire works display; which jostles the small skiff quite
"violently, throwing both Luke and Lando to the deck and almost"
causing Han to drop.
"The flaming barge drops into the sand pit, throwing Jabba, Bib and"
company into the waiting jaws of the sloth. Lando gains control of the
skiff and stabilizes the craft as Luke pulls Han on board.
46. EXT. DUNE SEA In the distance the burning wreckage of the
barge explodes a second time as a small periscope pops out of the
sand in the middle of a crater. Muffled beeps are heard and the
periscope looks around until it sees two golden feet sticking out of the
"sand not far away. A large shadow moves over the droids, and a"
voice is heard.
LUKE Artoo! Artoo up here.
The periscope looks up and sees the bottom of the skiff hovering
above. Luke is leaning over one side of the craft lowering a cable and
large magnet toward the sunken droid. In the skiff Han is helping
"Chewie to sit up, and is applying some first aid to the Wookiee’s"
wounded shoulder. The furry beast winces and growls at Han.
HAN I know it hurts. Just lay still.
Lando tries to maintain the skiff over the droids. The magnet is
attached to R-2′s head and he is slowly raised toward the craft. A
"second magnet attaches to the two golden feet, and pulls Threepio"
out of the sand.
"THREEPIO Oh, my head!"
"R-2, still dangling below the skiff beeps to his companion."
"THREEPIO Well, you should be sorry."
R-2 coos a sorry sigh as the skiff begins to pull away and head
across the dune sea.
47. EXT. FOREST HAD ABBADON MOON – BALL
GUN Camouflaged Land Speeders lift a large gun barrel into position
atop a huge ball shaped ion cannon. Leia and a REBEL
COMMANDER walk out of a low control bunker. The gun and control
area are in the process of being camouflaged by work crews and
other landspeeders.
CAPTAIN JODE We should have it completely covered by nightfall.
The Empire can’t possibly find us then.
"LEIA When you’ve finished, keep your men inside. Wait until the"
moon has made one full rotation before you target the shield
generator.
CAPTAIN JODE If that generator’s creating a shield powerful enough
"to protect those Death Stars, it’s not going to be that easy to knock"
out.
LEIA That’s why you have to line up precisely on the central tower.
"CAPTAIN JODE But, it’s too big for one of these size guns to do any"
damage….
LEIA If the shield around those Death Stars is still operational when
"the fleet attacks, they won’t have a chance. WE have to knock it out."
"I’m going back to the ship, to signal the fleet that we’re ready."
"CAPTAIN JODE As soon as we have the target lined up, I’ll contact"
you.
"Leia gets into a camouflaged armored landspeeder, and takes off into"
"the dense forest. Captain Jode shakes his head, then goes back to"
his work.
48. INT. DARTH VADER’S STAR DESTROYER BRIDGE Vader
stands on the bridge of his Star Destroyer looking out across the half
completed Death Stars. Admiral Piett approaches him.
"PIETT Yes, my Lord?"
VADER Where is the Grand Moff Jerjerrod?
PIETT He is in the private communication chamber.
VADER He is speaking with the Emperor?
"PIETT I’m not sure, all surveillance in the room has been cut off…."
and his coded transmission is undecipherable. He’s using a special
"code, I have come across nothing like it before."
VADER Have the extra patrols arrived on the sanctuary moon?
"PIETT Yes my Lord, GENERAL VEERS has taken command himself."
VADER Inform me when the Grand Moff has finished his
communication.
Vader turns his attention back to the Death Stars. Piett leaves.
49. INT. VADER’S STAR DESTROYER – COMMUNICATION
CHAMBER The Grand Moff Jerjerrod kneels before a huge
holographic image of the Emperor.
THE EMPEROR Take extra precautions. He is far stronger than his
father.
"JERJERROD Yes, Master. We will have the boy quite soon."
THE EMPEROR Vader is to know nothing of this. Young Skywalker
must be brought directly to me. Do you understand?
JERJERROD Yes Master.
THE EMPEROR …. and watch Lord Vader closely. He is powerful
and not to be underestimated.
JERJERROD Yes Master. He will be quite distracted. The Rebel
"attack is proceeding as you planned, and Lord Vader already"
suspects their presence. He has sent several units to the sanctuary
moon.
THE EMPEROR Good. Everything is falling into place.
"JERJERROD It is as you have foreseen, my Master."
"The Grand Moff bows low, and [the] supreme Emperor passes a"
hand over the crouched Jerjerrod and fades away.
50. FOREST HAD ABBADON MOON A squad of nimble one-man
Imperial rocket bikes speed around the giant trees of the medieval
forest. The ominous crunching sounds of huge metallic feet are a
"counterpoint to the high-pitched scream of the Rocket Bikes. Finally,"
out of the mist the monstrous shape of a two-legged Imperial walker
appears. The sinister machine slowly makes its way through the
dense foliage as the tiny Scout Bikes dart to and fro.
51. INT. IMPERIAL WALKER Two Imperial pilots sit at the controls in
"front of the main viewing port. General Veers stands to one side,"
watching a radar scope. One of the pilots turns toward the general.
"PILOT Sir, we’re approaching what appears to be a downed"
transport.
VEERS Send the scouts ahead….
PILOT I’ve picked up a small grouping of life forms.
VEERS Check the registry.
"PILOT Sir, our scouts are under attack!"
52. EXT. FOREST LANDING SITE – TRANSPORT A small battle is
raging around the Imperial Transport as the giant walker moves into
"the clearing. A few powerful blasts from the deadly machine, and the"
fighting stops.
53. EXT. HANGAR – HUTT SPACEPORT – SANDSTORM –
"DAY Lando leads Luke, Han, Chewie and the robots through a raging"
sandstorm toward the entrance to an underground starship hangar.
LANDO It’s not much further.
HAN I just hope you parked her out of this storm.
Chewie barks to his old friend that he picked the spot.
HAN Good work Chewie.
They make it to the shelter of the hangar entrance. Lando and
"Chewie trundle down the flight of stairs, as Han stops Luke just inside"
the doorway.
HAN Luke….
LUKE I’d better wait for the droids.
"HAN Listen Luke. I’m not much good at these things, but I just want"
to say thanks. We’re even…. I’m sorry I doubted you….You have
learned a lot….
"Luke laughs, and pats his old friend on the back."
LUKE Just a few tricks….
HAN Luke….Ah about Leia….I
LUKE I know everything. She loves you Han. My feelings for her are
different than yours. I’m not going to get in your way.
Han gives Luke a big hug as Threepio stumbles up to the entryway.
He looks a little worse for wear.
"THREEPIO Master Luke, Master Luke! They’ve taken Artoo…."
LUKE What? Where?
"THREEPIO (pointing) Back there…. two men, grabbed him. They’ll"
strip him for parts.
Han and Luke dash out of the entryway and into the full blast of the
sandstorm.
54. EXT. ALLEYWAY HUTT SPACEPORT – SANDSTORM.
They run down an alleyway looking for Artoo. The sand blows
furiously around them.
LUKE This way.
HAN I can’t see a thing…wait over there.
Han points at two cloaked figures disappearing down a narrow
passageway and starts after them. Luke follows. As Han rounds the
"corner, he is struck over the head by a powerful blow from behind. He"
"hits the ground with a thud revealing little Artoo, helplessly dangling"
from a strap tied halfway up the wall. One of the figures puts a hand
over the little droid’s mouth.
"1′ST FIGURE Get ready, here he comes."
"Luke rounds the corner, sees Han, Artoo, and is instantly surrounded"
by a cage that suddenly appears around him.
OFFICER Get his weapon.
Luke looks around and sees that he is trapped. He touches the bars
"of his cage, they’re electrified. His blaster is drawn out of his holster,"
and crashes against the magnetic bars.
"OFFICER Hurry, get him aboard the ship."
55. EXT. HANGAR – HUTT SPACEPORT SANDSTORM
Chewie and Lando join Threepio at the entrance to the Hangar.
LANDO What’s going on?
THREEPIO They went to rescue Artoo. He was…
Chewie barks and points at Artoo and Han struggling through the
sandstorm. Chewie and Lando go out to help Han.
HAN They’ve taken Luke…
The loud roar of a starship taking off can be heard overhead. They all
look up as it passes and fades in the distance.
"HAN Quick, we’ve got to go after them."
56. HUTT SPACEPORT – DAY
The Millenium Falcon roars off its’ landing pad and quickly disappears
into the sandstorm.
57. INT. COCKPIT – FALCON
Han and Chewie are at the controls and Lando and the robots sit in
the back. Chewie barks and flips a switch.
"HAN Yeah, that’s them all right. We can outrun them easy."
LANDO Unless…
"Out the cockpit window, the Imperial shuttle is very close when"
"suddenly it rockets away at a terrific rate of speed, and disappears."
LANDO (continued) … they go to lightspeed.
Chewie pushes forward on the throttle and the Falcon slows. Han
bangs his fist on the controls in anger.
HAN Blast it!
"LANDO Chewie, set your coordinates for the fleet…"
The Falcon rockets away into the stars.
58. HAD ABBADON MOON – IMPERIAL TRANSPORT
A couple of Rebel troops mill around the Imperial transport as two
speeders enter the clearing and stop. Several more troops exit the
huge spacecraft. Leia and CAPT. KAUN climb out of the speeders.
Leia turns to one of the Rebel troops.
LEIA Put them inside for the night.
They walk toward the transport.
"LEIA Now all we have to do is sit and wait. You know, it’s strange, but"
I don’t recognize any of these men.
"CAPTAIN KAUN That’s funny, neither do I."
A sudden realization crosses over their faces. They grab for their
"weapons, and run back toward the speeder. The Rebel troops start to"
fire at them and they dive behind one of the speeders. Out of the
forest rise four Imperial scouts on rocket bikes. Leia blasts one of
them and the bike crashes to the ground. The second speeder
"explodes, knocking two more of the rocket bikes to the ground. Kaun"
"runs over to the bike and takes off, quickly followed by Leia on the"
second bike. The troops fire at them as they escape. General Veers
comes out of the hold of the transport.
VEERS After them!
Four more scouts race from behind the transport on the rocket bikes.
The General turns to one of his officers.
VEERS Contact the fleet and inform Lord Vader we’ve got two on the
"run, and are following them back to the others."
59. HAD ABBADON MOON – FOREST
Leia and Captain Kaun dangerously maneuver their tiny rocket bikes
between the mammoth trees at speeds of two hundred miles per
"hour. They are closely followed by four other scouts, who"
occasionally fire at them. Explosions echo throughout the forest as
laser bolts rip into the trees. The two Rebels ride out over a ridge and
slowly float down to the forest below. The Imperial scouts follow in a
"hair-raising chase that bounces over hills, through narrow gullies, and"
in between trees. One of the Imperial scouts loses control and
explodes against a tree.
Captain Kaun has dropped a little behind Leia and blasted by one of
"the troops, causing him to crash. Now Leia is alone, being chased by"
three Imperial scouts. She rounds a narrow bend and a rope net
"suddenly shoots up in front of her, catching her bike and sending it"
head over heels. Leia lands unconscious on some soft leaves. The
three scouts race around the bend and aren’t so lucky. The first bike
"hits the net and the other two plow into it causing a big explosion,"
which engulfs the three scouts.
Leia remains unconscious as the explosion fades away.
60. EXT. REBEL FLEET
The Falcon arrives at the Rebel fleet and docks with one of the huge
Star Cruisers.
61. INT. MAIN BAY REBEL HEADQUARTERS – NIGHT
"Han, Chewie, Lando and the robots enter the main bay of the Rebel"
Cruiser and are greeted by Capt. New and several of his officers. Han
looks around for Leia.
CAPT. NEW You made it back just in time.
LANDO In time for what?
CAPT. NEW All units have been called together for one massive
attack against Had Abbadon. Where is Commander Skywalker?
"HAN Did I hear you right? Had Abbadon, the Imperial Capitol?"
Whose crazy idea was that? Where is she anyway? Where’s Leia?
"LANDO Luke has been captured, we came to get help to find him."
CAPT. NEW We’ve already started the staging procedures for the
attack. The General will want you with us.
HAN Now wait a second. Where is Leia?
Capt. New and his officer exchange worried looks.
CAPT. NEW We’d better get you to the General for a briefing.
62. WAR ROOM – REBEL HEADQUARTERS – NIGHT
The large war room is a hurricane of activity. Commanders stand in
small groups before large briefing screens as control officer rush
about exchanging information and getting things ready. Standing
"before a large electronic table is GENERAL MADINE, Captain New,"
"Han, Lando, Chewie and the robots. A planet and its satellites are"
"shown on the table display and as the General talks about a subject,"
it lights up or an arrow points to it.
"GENERAL MADINE … And using a captured Imperial transport, she"
has succeeded in establishing an ion cannon on the moon sanctuary
of Had Abbadon.
"LANDO … Which could knock out the shield generator, making those"
Death Stars vulnerable to a cruiser attack.
Han shakes his head at this crazy plan. Chewie barks.
"HAN I think this whole plan is nuts. Lando, you’re a tactics expert,"
what are their chances?
LANDO It’s been a long time since I’ve played this game. The odds
aren’t too good…
HAN You’re telling me!
LANDO … But if the fleet could be brought out of hyperspace on this
"side of the moon, it could just work. Now the timing will have to be"
very accurate…
"HAN Great, that’s all they need to hear. General Madine, meet"
"General Calrissian. You can stay here and play soldier if you want,"
"I’m leaving. Come on, Chewie."
"LANDO Han, wait! Where are you going?"
"HAN I’m going to that sanctuary moon, and I’m going to get Leia out"
"of there, then we’re going to find Luke."
MADINE She’ll never go with you.
LANDO You’ll never find him that way.
HAN Wanna bet! Vader’s got him.
"Han turns and walks away, followed by Chewie. Lando turns to the"
General and shakes his head.
LANDO And he thinks this plan is crazy…he’ll never get near that
moon.
Artoo and Threepio race after Han and Chewie as they leave the
room.
THREEPIO Hey! Wait for us!
63. EXT. REBEL FLEET – SPACE
The Falcon roars off of the landing platform into space.
64. INT. FALCON COCKPIT
Han and Chewie operate the controls of the modified freighter. The
giant Wookiee barks a long-winded question.
HAN Of course I have a plan… If I can just calculate the light speed
"coordinates close enough, we should come out of hyperspace right"
above the moon’s surface. We’ll have landed before they notice a
thing.
Chewie chatters an animated reply. Threepio looks at Artoo.
"HAN I know, I know, one millidigit too far and we’re so much space"
"dust. But there’s no other way, so hang on!"
Han pulls back on the lightspeed throttle and the stars streak out the
cockpit window. The Falcon zooms away into hyperspace in less than
a second.
65. HAD ABBADON MOON – FOREST
A strange little furry face with huge yellow eyes slowly comes into
"focus. The creature is an EWOK, named WICKET, and he seems"
"somewhat puzzled as he looks at the waking Princess. Leia groans,"
"which frightens the stubby ball of fuzz and he stumbles backward,"
falling on his tail with a loud squeak. Leia sits up and stares at the
"three foot high Ewok, trying to figure out where she is and what has"
happened. Her clothes are badly torn and she is fairly beat up.
The Ewok jumps up and grabs a four foot long spear which he holds
"in a defensive position. Leia watches him carefully as he circles her,"
poking occasionally with his sharp spear.
"LEIA Hey, cut that out. Don’t be afraid little fella, I won’t hurt you."
She stands up and the Ewok quickly backs away. She walks over to
the remains of the destroyed rocket bikes and surveys the wreckage
and notices what little remains of the rope net that stopped her. She
pulls a part of the rope down and studies it.
LEIA I’m afraid you caught more than you bargained for… what a
mess.
The little Ewok grabs the net out of her hands and starts scolding her
in a funny language made up of squeaks and barks. He points at the
"wreckage, then to the net, throws up his hands and marches around"
"in little circles, obviously upset at what Leia has done to his trap."
LEIA Calm down. My transport isn’t in such great shape either…
"Leia looks around at the dense forest, then with a sigh, she sits on a"
fallen log.
"LEIA And to top it off, I think I’m lost."
The fuzzy little Ewok sits on a smaller log next to Leia. He puts his
head in his hands with a great sigh. Leia scratches the little creature
on the head.
"LEIA Cheer up, things could be worse."
A loud snap and rustle of leaves is heard in the distance as the
"Ewok’s ears perk up, and he begins to sniff the air."
LEIA What is it?
"The Ewok lets out a loud screech, and starts to run, but a laser blast"
explodes right in front of the little creature. Leia draws her pistol and
jumps behind the log. A second flash comes out of the foliage and
"explodes in front of the log. Leia returns the fire, senses something"
and turns around to see two large Imperial Stormtroopers standing
over her with their guns pointed at her head. The scout officer
reaches out his hand for her weapon.
SCOUT OFFICER I’ll take that…
She hands her pistol over to the brutish officer as he turns to the
second scout.
SCOUT OFFICER (continued) Contact General Veers and tell him
that we’ve found one of them.
"Leia moves over in front of the little Ewok, and pushes him further"
under the log. The second scout goes back to where his rocket bike
is hidden in the foliage. A third scout rides his back into the clearing
and dismounts. The officer pulls Leia over to the third scout and
"roughly shoves her at him, then starts back to where his bike is"
hidden.
"The third scout takes out a pair of binders, and starts to put them on"
Leia’s wrists. A shrill scream is heard on the far side of the clearing.
"The scout looks over to see the officer holding Wicket, the Ewok, by"
one arm. Wicket swings at the trooper in vain.
OFFICER I think we’ve found another one.
"Taking advantage of the guards’ distraction, Leia brings her bound"
"fists straight up hard into the scout’s chin, knocking him unconscious."
She dives for her laser pistol as the scout officer drops the Ewok and
goes for his gun. Leia beats him to the draw and blasts him away.
"The second guard rides into the clearing, but his bike is hit by one of"
Leia’s laser blasts and is knocked end over tail. The forest is quiet
"once more. Wicket pokes his furry little head up from behind the log,"
"still a little dazed, and mumbling about what happened. Leia comes"
over to the chubby little Ewok and pulls him away into the dense
foliage.
"LEIA Come on, we’ve got to get out of here."
"As they run into the foliage, Wicket shrieks and tugs at Leia to follow"
him.
66. SPACE – HAD ABBADON
An Imperial shuttle roars over camera and heads for the polluted
"brown planet of Had Abbadon. It passes the green sanctuary moon,"
the Death Stars and Vader’s fleet.
67. INT. COCKPIT – IMPERIAL SHUTTLE
Two pilots operate the shuttle as an officer sits behind them.
OFFICER Steer clear of the fleet. The Emperor doesn’t want Lord
Vader to sense the boy’s presence.
68. INT. HOLD – SHUTTLE
Luke sits in a small metallic cell inside the hold of the shuttle. His
head is in his hands.
"LUKE Ben, help me…come to me, please Ben. I’m not strong enough"
"to face my father. Help me to resist the Dark Side of the Force. Ben,"
"Ben, please…"
"Luke looks up to see a shimmering, translucent image of Yoda"
standing in the tiny cell with him. Leia is startled by the vision.
LUKE Yoda?
YODA Ben can no longer help you. His power to stay in the
netherworld has been spent. He will soon be one with the Force. His
identity lost forever.
"LUKE No, help him. Bring him back…"
YODA Only you can draw him back to the material world. Stop your
anger.
"LUKE How, I can’t…"
"YODA You can’t, because that is what you think. Have you learned"
nothing?
"LUKE Master, I…"
YODA You cannot help Obi-Wan! You cannot face your father! You
cannot resist the Dark Side! The Emperor has already won.
"LUKE I’m sorry, I…"
YODA Sorry will not save you…or Obi-Wan…or your father destroy.
LUKE I have no will to destroy my father…there must be some good
"in him, I can feel it."
"YODA Destroy you he will, as he destroyed himself…this you must"
face…
"LUKE I am not strong enough, I will fail."
YODA If that is the way you feel…then I must turn to another for help.
LUKE Another? Who?
YODA The Force runs strong in the Skywalker line. If you will not
"destroy your father, there is only one other left who can…your sister."
LUKE Sister!!! I don’t have a sister.
YODA Strong with the Force is she; but untrained.
LUKE My sister?
"YODA Taken to Alderaan by your mother, was she. Safer it was to"
keep you apart.
LUKE Leia?!?
"YODA Your twin sister… If you fail to destroy your father, our only"
hope is she.
"Luke is stunned by this bit of information, and quickly becomes lost in"
thought.
69. EXT. SPACE – HAD ABBADON
The tiny shuttle rockets toward the planet of Had Abbadon.
70. INT. FALCON – COCKPIT
Han quickly works the controls of the Falcon as Chewie barks a
question.
HAN You’re right. I’ll reverse the polarity as soon as we’re out of
"hyperspace. Better strap yourself in Goldenrod, this could be a little"
rough.
Threepio gives Artoo a quick glance. The stubby little droid beeps a
short observation.
"THREEPIO That’s all right, Artoo, we don’t need to know the odds."
HAN Here we go.
Han pulls forward on the light speed throttle. The black void out the
cockpit window begins to streak with light and then the streaks
"become stars. Within a second or two, one of the stars rapidly grows"
into a planet; which appears to engulf the ship. The cockpit begins to
"shudder, then shake violently. Chewie barks and Artoo beeps. Han"
struggles to work the controls.
"HAN Chewie, we’re in the atmosphere, throw on the brake!"
71. MOON ATMOSPHERE
The Millenium Falcon glows like a comet as it streaks toward the
planet surface.
72. SUPER STAR DESTROYER – BRIDGE
Lord Vader is standing before the massive windows on the bridge.
"The huge rim of the moon can be seen out one side of the window,"
and the spidery superstructure of a Death Star can be seen out the
other. Vader studies the streaking comet as it disappears onto the
"moon surface. CAPTAIN NAFFER, in the control pit, is startled by"
something on one of his readouts.
CAPTAIN NAFFER We’ve picked up a ship coming out of
hyperspace. It appears to have collided with the moon.
VADER I saw it. Pinpoint the impact sight and tell General Veers to
investigate immediately.
"Vader notices Jerjerrod studying him from an alcove in the distance,"
as the captain hurries to implement his orders.
73. MOON FOREST – CLEARING
"The ramp lowers on the smoking Falcon, and Han, Chewie and the"
robots exit the craft.
THREEPIO I don’t think I want to try that again.
Chewie barks his agreement.
"HAN Come on, we’ve got no time to lose. The transport should be"
over this way.
"Han makes his way into the foliage, closely followed by the rest of the"
group.
74. CAVE ENTRANCE – MOON FOREST
"Wicket leads Leia along a narrow shaky wooden walkway, high in the"
giant trees. He stops at the end of the rickety walkway; which drops
away to nothing. Far below is a clearing. On the other side of the
clearing is a mountain with a sheer rock face. The Ewok points and
Leia nods. Wicket grabs a long vine tied to the walkway. It is attached
high above them in the trees. He hands Leia the vine and she grabs
"hold, he takes hold of the lower part of the vine. The little Ewok lets"
out a squeak and they swing across the clearing and into the cave.
75. INT. CAVE – EWOK VILLAGE
Leia follows Wicket through a small cave that opens into a large
"cavern. Along one wall of the cavern, a small village has been built"
under an outcropping of rocks. They enter the village which seems to
"be deserted, but Leia notices numerous little eyes peering out of the"
darkened doorway.
"Wicket stops before the largest hut in the small square, and calls out"
"something. A second Ewok, called TEEBO, comes out of the hut and"
"confers with Wicket. They point periodically at Leia, and then Teebo"
"goes back into the building. Wicket motions for Leia to follow, and"
they both go into the hut.
76. INT. CHIEF’S HUT
"A glowing fire dances in the middle of the Spartan, low ceilinged"
"room, causing a kaleidoscope of shadows on the walls. Leia sits on"
the ground before Wicket and Teebo. In the darkness across the
"room, a group of about ten Ewoks sit around a slightly larger grayhaired"
Ewok; CHIEF CHIRPA. The rhythmic beat of a skin drum
begins as the Ewok sitting next to Chief Chirpa begins to chant. This
"is LOGRAY, the medicine man of the tribe. Wicket stands and"
"chatters to the Chief, then sits again. The rest of the Ewoks begin to"
chant as Logray approaches Leia.
The haunting chant and the bizarre surroundings have a hypnotic
effect on the Princess. The trance is broken when the medicine man
"stands before her, and suddenly her hands are pinned to the ground"
by Wicket and Teebo. The chanting and drums stop as Logray grabs
"Leia’s head and yanks open her mouth, seemingly inspecting her"
teeth. He then looks at her eyes and ears. Finally he lets go and
barks something to the assembly. The Chief replies to the medicine
man and the drums begin to beat again.
Logray takes a bowl of ugly looking brew and offers it to Leia. Wicket
and Teebo release her hands. She is a little leery about taking the
foul smelling soup. Wicket quietly says something to her. She finally
"gets up the courage to taste it. It’s good, and she drinks the entire"
bowl to the screeching and barking cheers of the assembly. Wicket
"jumps up and hugs Leia, as do several other of the fuzzy little Ewoks."
Leia’s tension fades away amid the joyous celebration of the furry
little creatures.
77. LANDING AREA – HAD ABBADON
"The ramp of the Imperial shuttle lowers, and Imperial troops line up"
"outside the spacecraft. A captain of the Royal Guard, and about a"
dozen of his men march up to the shuttle as six stormtroopers escort
the heavily bound young Jedi down the ramp. The officer speaks to
one of the stormtroopers.
GUARD OFFICER Did he give you much trouble?
STORMTROOPER None at all.
The guard officer studies Luke closely.
GUARD OFFICER He appears to be in good condition. The Emperor
will be pleased. Take him.
The sergeant of the guard barks a command and all of the troops turn
and march into the massive Imperial palace of Had Abbadon.
78. MAIN HALLWAY – IMPERIAL PALACE – HAD ABBADON
Luke and his escort follow the officer down a vast hallway lined with
Royal Guards. A group of star fleet captains stop their conversation
and watch the prisoner as he passes. The captains recognize Luke
and whisper among themselves until the squad of guards is far in the
distance.
1ST CAPTAIN I’m sure it’s him.
2ND CAPTAIN Inform Lord Vader.
79. THRONE ROOM – HAD ABBADON
"They enter a vast throne room, and stop. The guards line up behind"
"Luke and snap to attention. On the far side of the room is a long, wide"
flight of stairs that leads to a throne that is silhouetted by a huge
window behind it.
"Sitting on the throne is a small, shrouded figure. This is the Emperor."
"Supreme Ruler of the Galactic Empire, and Master of the Dark Side"
of the Force. His voice echoes through the huge throne room.
"EMPEROR Come forward, young Jedi."
"Luke walks forward until he is at the foot of the stairs then stops,"
trying to get a look at the silhouetted figure on the throne.
"EMPEROR Yes, you are much like your father. Strong with the Force."
You will make a powerful ally.
LUKE You cannot turn me to the Dark Side you did my father…
EMPEROR I did not turn him to the Dark Side. That is something he
did for himself…as you will do for yourself.
LUKE Never!
EMPEROR We will see. Take him to the tombs.
The guards rush up behind Luke and escort him away.
80. EXT. FOREST LANDING SIGHT – TRANSPORT
"The transport is deserted, and the clearing appears tranquil as Han,"
Chewie and the robots survey the situation from a hiding place in the
dense underbrush. Han takes out his com-link.
THREEPIO Looks peaceful enough.
"HAN (into com-link) Blue Two, this is Red One. Do you copy?"
VOICE (on com-link) Loud and clear. What are you doing here?
HAN Just waiting for your confirmation. Is Leia with you?
VOICE (on com-link) Sure enough. She’s in the back.
HAN Let’s go!
"Before he can get up, he is stopped by Chewie who barks his"
concern.
"HAN Well, it seems all right to me."
"Han gets up and starts into the clearing, closely followed by Chewie"
and the others. They arrive at the main hatch of the Imperial
"transport, and Han stops Chewie."
HAN Let me go first. Wait here.
Chewie shrugs as Han cautiously enters the transport hold.
81. INT. TRANSPORT HOLD
"The vast hold is empty, except for a couple of Rebel speeders. He"
"starts to walk toward the speeders, when two Imperial scouts come"
up behind him with their guns drawn.
SCOUT #3 That’s far enough! Rebel scum.
"Han freezes. Outside, laser blasts and a lot of yelling can be heard."
Threepio can barely be heard in the distance.
"THREEPIO Captain Solo, it’s a trap!"
SCOUT #3 Now turn around.
"Han turns in a split second, draws his gun and blasts the two Imperial"
scouts before they can fire.
82. EXT. FOREST LANDING SIGHT – TRANSPORT
The clearing is chaos as Han exits the transport. Imperial scouts are
blasting away at Chewie and the robots who are hidden behind some
trees on the far side of the clearing. The scouts have their back to the
transport.
"HAN Chewie, run for it!!!"
"Several of the scouts turn toward Han, but are blasted away by the"
smuggler before they can fire. Chewie and the robots dash into the
"underbrush. The scouts are unable to follow them, because their"
attention has been focused on Han who is firing away at them. They
scramble for cover as a monstrous two-legged walker enters the
"clearing and starts firing at Han, causing huge explosions all around"
"him. He makes a break for the trees, but is cut off by an explosion."
Han dives for cover under the landing gear of the transport. As the
"giant walker moves in on him, he makes another dash for the woods,"
and this time he makes it. Han races through the trees as the sounds
of the huge walker’s feet pound behind him.
83. EXT. RAIN FOREST MOON
Han and Chewie are huffing and puffing as they meet up near a large
"tree. In the distance, the robots can be heard coming through the"
foliage. Chewie barks.
"HAN I think we lost them, Chewie."
The robots make their way out of the underbrush. Artoo beeps.
THREEPIO (to Han) Artoo’s sensor indicates the walker is moving
away from us.
HAN This turned into a bigger mess than I expected. We’ve got to
"find that ion cannon. Leia’s sure to be there, if she hasn’t been"
captured.
"Threepio notices a stick in the ground next to Artoo, with several"
shanks of raw meat hanging from it.
"THREEPIO Hello, what’s this? It looks like someone’s dinner."
Han and Chewie go over to see what it is they’ve found. Chewie
reaches for one of the meat shanks.
HAN No wait!! Don’t touch it -
"But it is too late, the hungry Wookiee has already pulled one of the"
pieces of meat off of the stick. A loud “sproing” is heard and the group
"finds itself hanging upside down in an Ewok net, suspended high"
above the clearing. Artoo lets out a screech and Chewie barks.
"HAN Chewie, someday that stomach of yours is gonna do us in…"
84. VADER’S PRIVATE CHAMBER – STAR DESTROYER
"The door to the private chamber slides open, and the Dark Lord of"
the Sith storms into the room. His voice echoes through the chamber.
VADER Jerjerrod!
"JERJERROD (V.O.) It is not necessary to shout, my old friend."
VADER What is the Emperor doing with my son…
"JERJERROD My Lord Vader, the Emperor does not have to answer"
"to you… besides, I don’t believe he has your son. Where did you"
come by this piece of erroneous information?
VADER He’s been seen at the palace…and that’s where I’m going!
JERJERROD The Emperor would prefer you didn’t…you would go
against his wishes. The Rebel attack is about to begin. You are truly
"fearless, my old friend."
Vader lifts the Grand Moff by the neck and begins to lift him off the
ground with one hand; Jerjerrod gasps for air and struggles to free
himself from the Dark Lord’s iron grip.
"VADER You are not my friend, bureaucrat. I will go to the palace, but"
you will not live to see it. I no longer wish to be annoyed by your
simpering ways.
JERJERROD The Emperor will destroy you for this.
"Vader snaps the man’s neck, and he drops to the floor in a heap."
VADER I think not…your importance has been greatly exaggerated.
"Vader exits the room, and the door slams shut behind him."
85. EXT. SPACE – REBEL FLEET
The vast Rebel fleet stretches out as far as the eye can see.
"Overhead, a dozen CORELLIAN small BATTLESHIPS fly in"
formation over the fleet. Fighters and battle cruisers surround the
largest of the Rebel Starships; the mammoth HEADQUARTERS
FRIGATE.
86: INT. WAR ROOM – HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE
Hundreds of Rebel commanders of all races and kinds sit on
bleachers in a circle to one side of the war room. In the center of the
"bleacher area is a hologram model of Had Abbadon, the sanctuary"
moon and the Death Stars. Standing in the center is General Madine
and ADMIRAL ACKBAR.
"On a raised area in front of the bleachers are MON MOTHMA, the"
"Leader of the Alliance and several senators. Mon Mothma is a stern,"
but beautiful woman in her fifties. Lando sits on the bleachers with the
other Rebel commanders.
GENERAL MADINE The Corellian fleet has just arrived. All units are
now in position and accounted for. The attack can begin!
"There is a cheer from the Commanders. Admiral Ackbar, a pale blue"
"non-human CREATURE, moves to the center of the stage. He"
"speaks in an unusual language that is translated, by a computer, and"
transmitted to the commanders’ headphones.
ADMIRAL ACKBAR You have all been briefed on your targets. Green
Group will attack the Death Stars…Red Group will attack Had
"Abbadon…Blue Group will attack the Imperial fleet, here and the"
"planet’s surface, here and here. If the Empire is to fall, all of the"
objectives must be destroyed.
GENERAL MADINE There will be no second chance. The
expeditionary unit on the sanctuary moon will signal when they have
"targeted the main shield generator. If they are unsuccessful, and the"
energy shield is still in place around the Death Stars when the attack
begins…well…do the best you can.
A murmur runs through the assembly; which is hushed when Mon
Mothma stands. She slowly looks over the Rebel commanders before
she speaks.
MON MOTHMA We ask much of you. The fate of the Alliance rests in
"this one decisive battle. But, if the Death Stars are completed, many"
of our homelands will be destroyed and the Alliance will crumble…we
"have nothing to lose, and everything to gain. The time has come to"
stop hiding and face the Empire one to one…Man your ships with
"fortitude and resolve, for good shall triumph. May the Force be with"
you.
87. EXT. RAIN FOREST – MOON
"Han, Chewie and the robots are still hanging in the Ewok trap. The"
Star Captain and the Wookiee are attempting to saw through the top
of the net with small pieces of metal. Artoo is cutting away at the
bottom of the net.
HAN This is going to take forever.
"Suddenly, Artoo cuts through, and the entire group tumbles out of the"
"net, crashing to the ground. As Han regains his senses and sits up,"
"he realizes they are surrounded by about twenty Ewoks, pointing long"
spears at them.
HAN Point that thing somewhere else!
"Han pushes the spear out of his face, and a second Ewok lunges at"
"him. Han manages to deflect the oncoming spear, but his arm is cut"
rather severely. Wicket rushes forward and pushes his fellow Ewok
"away, scolding him with a lot of loud screeching and yelling. Han is"
holding his arm in pain. Chewie growls at the Ewoks. Artoo and
Threepio are tangled up in what’s left of the net.
"HAN Threepio, can you understand this gibberish?"
"Threepio untangles himself from the net and sits up, still a little"
rattled.
"THREEPIO Oh, my head…"
"When the Ewoks see Threepio, they let out a gasp and mumble"
"among themselves. Threepio speaks to them in their native tongue,"
and one of the Ewoks nearest to the golden robot drops his spear
"and bows on his hands and knees. In a moment, all of the other"
Ewoks have followed suit. Chewie lets out a puzzled bark. Han looks
around at the prostrate creatures in wonder. The Ewoks begin to
chant at Threepio.
HAN What did you say to them?
"THREEPIO Hello, I think…I could be wrong, they’re using a very"
"primitive dialect, but I believe they think I’m some sort of deity."
Artoo and Chewbacca both laugh at this. Han shakes his head in
disbelief.
"HAN Well, use your divine influence to get us out of this…"
"THREEPIO I beg your pardon, Sir, but that wouldn’t be proper."
HAN Wouldn’t be proper?!?
THREEPIO It’s against my programming.
"HAN Listen, you bend the rules a little, or I’m going to bend you!"
Several Ewok spears are thrust in Captain Solo’s face as he grabs for
Threepio.
88. HAD ABBADON – THE TOMB’S PRISON
Luke lies unconscious on a small island in the middle of a hot lava
lake. A hot wind blows across his face and wakes him. He looks
around at his hostile surroundings and suddenly becomes aware of
another person sitting behind him. He turns on the intruder with Jedi
speed. The shrouded figure doesn’t move or even look up.
LUKE Ben…
"Slowly, the hooded figure looks up, revealing his face. It is Ben"
Kenobi in the flesh.
BEN I could no longer stay in the netherworld.
LUKE But Yoda said…
BEN …that I would become one with the Force and choose not to
return to the material world? That your anger prevented me from…
LUKE But I’m not angry…not anymore…I understand why you didn’t
tell me about my father. I do.
"BEN I know. And I am here to help you destroy the Emperor,"
and…your father.
LUKE I can’t.
Suddenly Yoda appears beside Ben.
"YODA You can and you will…I in the netherworld, and Obi-Wan at"
your side. Help you we will.
89. EXT. SPACE – REBEL FLEET
A vast array of mighty Rebel Star Cruisers move through the
"heavens, surrounded by hundreds of tiny fighters of all types."
90. INT. REBEL CRUISER – BRIDGE
Captain New and Lando sit above the main control deck of the Rebel
Cruiser.
CAPTAIN NEW Admiral Ackbar is bringing the third fleet into position.
LANDO Are the light speed coordinates set?
"CAPTAIN NEW Yes, Sir."
LANDO Have Red Group move their ships further out. We can’t
afford any collisions on re-entry.
Captain New repeats into the com-link.
"CAPTAIN NEW Back off, Red Group. (to Lando) How long do you"
think we’re going to have to wait out here?
LANDO Leia missed her scheduled check-in. So all we can do is
hope it won’t be long.
91. INT. CAVE – EWOK VILLAGE
A long procession of Ewoks winds its’ way toward the village square.
"Han is tied to a long pole and is wrapped in vines, cocoon-like. The"
"pole is carried on the shoulders of eight Ewoks, and are followed by"
"Chewie and Artoo tied up in a similar fashion. Behind the captives,"
"Threepio is carried on a litter Emperor-style, on the shoulders of ten"
Ewoks.
"When they reach the village square, Han, Chewie and Artoo are"
placed on large spits over what looks like a barbeque pit. Logray
comes out of one of the huts and slowly walks to the raised area
where they have set down Threepio in his litter. The medicine man
"stands before the golden droid, studying him very carefully. Han and"
Chewie begin to look a little worried as Ewoks start to put firewood in
the pit below them.
"HAN Threepio, they’re going to barbeque us unless you do"
something!
"Threepio stands, and says something in the Ewok tongue. Logray"
gasps and falls to his hands and knees chanting a prayer. The rest of
the Ewoks do the same. Threepio asks the Ewoks to stand and as
"they do, he walks through the crowd of funny little creatures, and"
"stands before Han. He says something to Logray, pointing at his"
friends tied to the stakes. The medicine man replies in a most
animated way. He appears to be a little upset by what the golden
droid has told him.
"HAN Well, what’d they say?"
"THREEPIO I’m rather embarrassed, Sir, but it appears you are to be"
the main course at a banquet in my honor. He is quite offended that I
should suggest otherwise…
Chewie barks angrily at Threepio.
"HAN You said it, Chewie, and tell them you’ll do more than offend"
them if they don’t do as you say. Tell them you have the power to
"make this place cave in, or something."
"THREEPIO Oh, I couldn’t do that Captain Solo, what if they asked me"
to prove it! Let me see if I can’t persuade them another way.
Threepio turns to Logray and carries on a rather long-winded
conversation with the medicine man. The Ewok answers the droid
"and then goes over to Han, poking him in several places. He then"
"moves over to Chewie, poking the growling Wookiee also, and finally"
he goes over to Artoo and taps his metal hide two or three times.
"Logray orders the Ewoks to untie the little astro droid, which they do,"
sending him crashing to the ground with a scream.
"THREEPIO Careful, careful, I mean…"
He continues in the Ewok tongue as the furry creatures stand Artoo
"upright. The little droid is angry and beeps a blue streak at Teebo,"
causing him to back up in fear. Artoo continues to pursue the Ewok
"with angry whistles and beeps. Finally, Artoo zaps the Ewok with an"
"electric charge and Teebo turns running into one of the huts,"
screaming.
"THREEPIO Artoo, stop that! You’re only going to make things worse."
Artoo beeps angry chatter at the taller droid.
THREEPIO I beg your pardon? I have no intention of taking orders
from you!
The stubby little droid has moved under Han and starts to cut him
loose. The Ewoks become upset and start for Han and Artoo. The
"little droid lets out a loud screech and turns on the Ewoks, still angry,"
and whistles at them. They scatter in all directions as the little droid
chases one of them around in circles.
Threepio raises his hands and shouts at the Ewoks in their squealing
language. He resembles an evangelist saving his children. The
"Ewoks fall to the ground, in homage to the golden droid. Threepio"
points to several Ewoks and barks a command. The Ewoks rush to
"untie Han and Chewbacca, as Artoo scolds and advises them. The"
two prisoners are cut loose and drop to the ground in a heap.
92. INT. CHIEF’S HUT
"Wicket, Teebo, Logray and several other Ewoks enter the chief’s hut,"
followed by Threepio and several more Ewoks. On the far side of the
hut sits Chief Chirpa and the village elders. To one side of this group
"stands Leia, wearing an animal skin dress. She sees Threepio and"
"rushes over to him, but is stopped by Ewok guards."
LEIA Threepio!
THREEPIO Mistress Leia?
LEIA AND THREEPIO (together) What are you doing here??
Leia looks past the golden robot and sees Han and Chewie enter the
"hut, surrounded by Ewoks. Han sees her at the same time. Leia runs"
to the dashing Star Captain and throws her arms around him. He
swings her around in an embrace. Artoo finally trundles into the hut
and begins to whistle a happy tune.
"LEIA Han, you escaped, you’re alive!"
HAN If you call this living. Who are these friends of yours anyway?
LEIA I don’t know. I haven’t had much success communicating with
"them. They’re friendly enough, but they won’t let me leave."
"Threepio is sitting on Chief Chirpa’s throne, and all the Ewoks,"
"including the Chief and Logray, bow down before him. The Ewok"
"guards poke at Han, Leia and Chewie, causing them to kneel also."
Han refuses to kneel.
HAN You’re crazy if you think I’m…
He is jabbed with one of the sharp spears and immediately sits down.
"HAN All right. All right… Threepio, you’d better tell them why we’re"
"here, and quick… (to Leia) They think he’s the creator or"
something…
LEIA Maybe he can convince them how important it is for us to leave.
Threepio stands and begins a long animated speech in the Ewoks’
"native tongue. The Ewok elders, Chief and medicine man sit around"
the fire listening to Threepio speak in their squeaky language. He
"points several times to Han and company, then pantomimes an"
"Imperial walker, then makes a crude sound that signifies an"
explosion. The Ewoks stare at Han and Leia and mumble among
"themselves. Logray confers with the Chief, then asks Threepio a"
"question. The golden droid answers, and the Ewok Chief starts to"
shake his head in a negative fashion.
"Wicket can contain himself no longer, stands up and makes a rather"
fiery speech. The Chief and elders nod in agreement. The Chief
"stands and makes a pronouncement pointing at Wicket, then at"
"Threepio, then finally at Han and company."
"Suddenly, all the Ewoks jump up with a great yip and cheer. Several"
"of the little teddy bears run up and hug Han, Leia and Chewie. One"
"starts to hug Artoo, but thinks better of it as the little droid backs off"
with a low warning rumble. Han pulls one of the clinging Ewoks from
"around his neck, and sets the funny little creature on the ground,"
giving him a light pat on the head.
THREEPIO You are now a part of the tribe. They welcome your
efforts to kill the giant walkers and they will give you what they can…
HAN Great! We’ll need supplies and two of their best warriors to
guide us to that ion cannon.
LEIA Let’s just hope the Empire hasn’t gotten there first.
93. INT. REBEL CRUISER – MAIN BRIDGE
A hologram of a Rebel officer appears before Lando and the cruiser
captain.
"HOLOGRAM OFFICER Commander, the fleet has been spotted by"
an Imperial Star Destroyer. We are currently in pursuit…
The hologram fades off.
CAPTAIN That finishes it; we can’t stay out here much longer.
A second hologram appears. It is the Admiral.
ADMIRAL All commands will hold their position. The Empire will need
"a sizable fleet to attack us, and I doubt if they will discover our target,"
so we still have a bit more time. Sit tight.
"LANDO If we don’t get that signal soon, I’m going to begin to think"
that they didn’t make it. They’re probably just trying to make us
nervous.
"CAPTAIN Well, they’ve succeeded."
94. EXT. CAVE ENTRANCE – FOREST
Han swings from the cave entrance to the rickety footbridge where
"Leia, Threepio and Artoo are waiting for Teebo. Chewie waits with"
Wicket in the cave entrance for his turn to swing across.
"HAN Threepio, you and Artoo are going to have to make your way"
back to the Millenium Falcon and signal the fleet to attack…
Chewie swings across and lands with a gleeful bark.
HAN You’d better take one of these fuzzies with you and be careful.
You might run into one of those patrols.
"LEIA We should have signaled some time ago, so hurry."
"Artoo, Threepio, and Teebo hurry off across the shaky wooden"
walkway.
95. EXT. LANDING AREA – HAD ABBADON
The Imperial shuttle lands on the windswept platform of Had
Abbadon. TIE Fighters fly overhead as the boarding ramp lowers and
Lord Vader descends to the flight deck. He walks alone toward the
Imperial palace.
96. INT. MAIN HALLWAY TO THRONE ROOM
"Vader’s footsteps echo through the vast, long hallway. The Royal"
Guards that line the walls watch him with great fear. Finally he
reaches the massive doors that open on to the throne room. The two
guards on either side of the doors move to block the Dark Lord.
"1ST GUARD I’m sorry Lord Vader, the Emperor does not wish…"
Both of the guards are stopped in their tracks as they drop their
weapons and grab for their throats in a vain attempt to breathe. They
drop gasping to the floor as the giant doors slide open and the Dark
Lord enters the Emperor’s chamber.
97. INT. THRONE ROOM – HAD ABBADON
Vader storms into the throne room and marches right up to where the
Emperor is sitting. The Emperor slowly raises his head to stare at the
Dark Lord.
VADER Where is he?
EMPEROR Safe…There is no need for you to worry. I will take good
care of him…
VADER It is for me to train my son…you must…
"The Emperor raises his hand, and Vader’s breathing suddenly stops."
"The Dark Lord struggles at his controls, attempting to regain his air"
supply. He chokes.
EMPEROR You forget yourself…Lord Vader. I will tolerate no more
discussion on the subject. The boy is mine to train. Your place is with
the fleet.
Vader collapses on the floor and the Emperor lowers his hand. Vader
starts breathing again and rises to a kneeling position.
"VADER Forgive me, master."
EMPEROR The Rebels will soon begin their attack. You must be
"ready for them. For now that I have all of them in one place, they will"
be crushed once and for all.
"VADER Yes, my master."
"EMPEROR Now take your leave, for I have your son to attend to."
"Vader rises and exits the throne room, and the giant door slides"
closed behind him.
98. EXT. REBEL FLEET – SPACE
The vast Rebel fleet drifts through space.
99. INT. REBEL CRUISER – COCKPIT
The tension mounts as the crew waits for the signal to attack. The
"moments tick by, and Lando raps his fingers on the console. He looks"
"worried, and speaks into the com-link."
"LANDO Admiral, I don’t think we can wait much longer out here. That"
Imperial destroyer should have returned with reinforcements by now.
Something’s funny…I’ll bet they know what we’re after and are just
waiting for us to move…
"ADMIRAL (V.O.) That’s possible, but if we go in and that shield is up,"
we won’t stand a chance…! We’ll wait a little longer.
Lando clicks off the intercom and turns to the captain.
LANDO I have a bad feeling about this. I hope we get that signal
soon.
He lapses back into his preoccupied worried look.
100. EXT. MILLENIUM FALCON – LANDING SITE
The Falcon is surrounded by a half dozen Imperial rocket bikes.
"Threepio, Artoo and the little Ewok Teebo are hidden in the foliage."
The stubby little droid beeps and whistles.
THREEPIO Don’t ask me what to do! You think of something. I’m not
designed for this sort of thing.
"Teebo chatters something and Threepio barks a question, which the"
"Ewok quickly answers. The golden droid chatters his approval, and"
Teebo takes off into the underbrush.
THREEPIO He’s going to distract them so that we can sneak inside.
Artoo beeps a question.
"THREEPIO I don’t know, but he says it’s something that he has"
wanted to do for a long time. I hope it works.
"All of the scouts are inside the Falcon except one, who is leaning"
against the hatchway sound asleep. The little Ewok darts out of the
"foliage on the far side of the Falcon, and hides behind one of the"
giant landing gears. Teebo can hear the troops moving around inside
the ship.
101. INT. FALCON – HOLD
Several of the Imperial scouts lounge around as the others go
"through the storage compartments, throwing things on the floor of the"
hold.
102. INT. FALCON – COCKPIT
"A scout moves about the cockpit, flipping switches and searching"
"everywhere. Finding nothing, he exits the cockpit, just as a light starts"
flashing on the main control panel. A faint voice can be heard on the
com-link.
VOICE Threepio? Threepio?
103. EXT. FOREST – GUN EMPLACEMENT
"Han, Chewie, Wicket and Leia are hidden in the trees overlooking the"
ion cannon. The control bunker is swarming with Imperial troops and
two scout walkers patrol the clearing in front of the gun. Chewie
quietly growls at Han who is speaking into a com-link.
"HAN …come in, Threepio…blast it! You’re right Chewie, we should"
have given them a com-link.
LEIA I hope they’re not in trouble.
"HAN Not as much as we are anyway. With any luck, they won’t be"
able to signal the fleet until we clean up this little mess.
LEIA How are we going to get in there?
"HAN I don’t know! This whole thing was your idea, you tell me!"
Leia shrugs her shoulders and lets out a great sigh.
104. EXT. MILLENIUM FALCON – LANDING SITE
Teebo crawls between several of the rocket bikes to the snoring
sounds of the sleeping guard. The little Ewok struggles up onto the
seat of one of the powerful rocket bikes. The scout momentarily
"wakes up, which stops his snoring. Teebo freezes. The scout goes"
"back to sleep, and the little Ewok gives the control panel of the rocket"
"bike a puzzled look. He scratches his head, chattering to himself, and"
"then with a shrug, he starts flipping switches."
"Artoo whistles in hushed tones, as he and Threepio watch the Ewok"
on the bike.
"THREEPIO I have no idea what he’s up to…quite frankly, I don’t think"
he knows what he’s doing. He’d better be careful or he’ll hurt himself.
Artoo beeps a question.
THREEPIO I don’t know why I listened to him either.
"Teebo pulls a little lever on the side of the bike, and the machine"
comes to life with a roar. The scout wakes up with a start as the little
"Ewok screams and shoots out of the clearing on the rocket bike,"
"holding on for dear life. The scout shouts an alarm and, firing at"
"Teebo, runs for his own bike. The other five scouts rush out of the"
Falcon to see what the commotion is all about. The scout on the bike
yells at the others as he races out of the clearing after the stolen bike.
1ST SCOUT He took the bike!
"The rest of the scouts jump on their bikes and take off after the Ewok,"
"leaving the scout whose bike was stolen behind. In anger, he throws"
a container to the ground and wanders back inside the Falcon.
Threepio and Artoo watch all of this from their hiding place. Artoo
beeps a statement and starts for the Falcon. Threepio reluctantly
follows.
THREEPIO I can’t believe I’m doing this. I must be malfunctioning.
105. INT. HOLD – MILLENIUM FALCON
The scout continues to rummage through cabinets in the hold of the
"Falcon as Artoo and Threepio slip by in the background, heading for"
the cockpit.
106. INT. COCKPIT – FALCON
Threepio and Artoo enter the cockpit.
"THREEPIO Hurry, Artoo, before we’re discovered!"
Artoo plugs into a computer socket and beeps a message. A series of
"tones is heard, then the stubby droid whistles a few words and exits"
the cockpit with Threepio following.
107. INT. HOLD – MILLENIUM FALCON
Threepio peeks around the corner to see the scout standing quite
"near him. He ducks back into the hallway, and whispers to Artoo."
THREEPIO We’re trapped.
108. INT. REBEL CRUISER – MAIN BRIDGE
The control panel lights up as Artoo’s signal is received by the Rebel
fleet. A hologram of the Admiral appears before Lando and the
cruiser captain.
ADMIRAL We have just received the confirmation signal. All ships will
prepare to move into light speed.
"LANDO They did it! They’ve blown up the shield generator. Come on,"
let’s get this bucket moving!
"The controller pulls back on the light speed throttle, and the stars"
streak and disappear out the bridge window.
109. EXT. FOREST – LANDING SITE
Teebo stumbles out of the forest and into the clearing in front of the
Falcon. The little Ewok is pretty beaten up and appears to be in
shock. He lets out a loud howl.
110. INT. FALCON – HOLD
The scout runs out of the hold and starts down the boarding ramp
"with his gun drawn. Artoo tears out after him, with Threepio following."
"THREEPIO Wait, Artoo, what are you doing?"
The scout stands at the foot of the ramp with his gun pointed at
"Teebo. But before he can fire, Artoo comes flying down the ramp and"
"plows into him, knocking the Imperial scout head over heels. The"
laser pistol fires harmlessly in the air. Threepio rushes past the fallen
Imperial trooper and follows Artoo and Teebo into the dense
underbrush.
111. INT. HAD ABBADON – HALLWAY TO THRONE ROOM
The huge doors to the throne room slide open and the Emperor
strides into the long hallway. The Royal Guards snap to attention as
"he passes. About halfway down the hallway, an Imperial General"
"rushes up to the Emperor, and bows."
"GENERAL My Lord, the Rebels have moved into hyperspace. The"
attack is imminent.
EMPEROR. Excellent. Alert the fleet!
"The general rushes off, and the Emperor continues until he arrives at"
a large stone room flanked by rows of elevators. He enters one of the
elevators and it descends into a vast steaming pit. Out of the
"shadows of a large column, a large dark figure emerges…it is Darth"
"Vader. He raises his hand and the guards turn away, allowing him to"
sneak into one of the elevators and follow the Emperor.
112. INT. HAD ABBADON – TOMB’S DUNGEON
Luke stands with a start and begins to look around. Ben slowly stands
also.
LUKE Did you feel that?
BEN Yes. It’s the Emperor. He’s moving this way…
LUKE …and so is my father.
BEN He is following the Emperor. Yoda!
YODA’S VOICE I am between them and the Force…cloud their
"minds, I will."
"BEN Luke, you must take them on one at a time. Together, they will"
destroy you…
The Emperor enters the cavern and looks across to the boiling lava
lake. He sees Ben and is surprised.
"EMPEROR So you are not dead after all, Obi-Wan. I thought I felt"
"your presence in the netherworld. So, you have returned. But you"
"have failed…the boy is mine, and will soon embrace the Dark Side."
"YODA It is you who have failed, my old friend."
The Emperor turns around to see the shimmering image of Yoda
standing before him.
EMPEROR You!
"YODA Evil one, this will be the last day of your existence."
EMPEROR Your presence in the netherworld can do me no harm.
And neither can this boy or this old man.
"YODA Your fear is strong…overestimate your abilities, you do."
Vader steps out of the shadows and stands next to the Emperor.
"VADER My Master, they must be destroyed. Now it is too late to turn"
the boy.
"Luke looks at his father, then reaches out and Vader’s lasersword"
leaps off the Dark Lord’s belt and into the young Jedi’s hand. Luke
ignites the lasersword as the Emperor pulls a sword out of his sleeve
and tosses it to Vader.
EMPEROR Destroy them.
Vader’s sword ignites and he starts to move toward his son. Luke
backs away.
113. EXT. FOREST – GUN EMPLACEMENT
"Wicket chatters and pulls on Han Solo’s arm, trying to get him to"
move away.
HAN Don’t bother me. Go away.
LEIA I think he’s trying to tell you something.
"Wicket points to the top of a tall tree, then makes a diving motion"
down to the walker.
HAN You mean jump?!?
Han makes a motion with his hand and the little Ewok shakes his
head yes.
"Han looks up at the tree, then down at the walker."
"HAN It’s too far, forget it."
A small com-link on Leia’s belt begins to buzz.
LEIA The fleet! They’re attacking!
HAN That doesn’t give us much time. Come on…
114. EXT. SPACE – REBEL FLEET
The massive Rebel fleet moves toward the distant planet of Had
Abbadon.
115. INT. REBEL CRUISER – BRIDGE
"Lando moves over to one of the computer screens, then turns back to"
the Cruiser Captain.
LANDO Have group seven and nine split off and start phase two…
CAPTAIN Several Imperial cruisers are approaching!
LANDO Launch the fighters!
116. EXT. SPACE – REBEL CRUISER
"A group of X-Wing Fighters are dropped out of the main hold, and"
rocket off toward the approaching Imperial Cruisers. Behind the
"Imperial warships, the two Death Stars orbit Had Abbadon. The"
Rebel fighters attack the Imperial Cruisers and the fighting is intense.
117. EXT. FOREST – GUN EMPLACEMENT
"Artoo, Threepio and Teebo make their way onto a ridge overlooking"
the gun emplacement. Artoo beeps and whistles as he spots Han and
Leia.
"THREEPIO I see them! Come on, they need help!"
He turns to Teebo and explains this to him. He repeats the Ewok
"word for help, then grabs a shell horn at his side and blows. A loud"
howl echoes throughout the forest. All of the Stormtroopers below
"look up. So does Han, Leia and Wicket. Wicket starts to chatter"
excitedly and points to the droids.
HAN Now what?
LEIA It’s Artoo and Threepio.
HAN Did they have to announce their arrival? Look out!
Laser blasts start to explode all around them as the Stormtroopers
"discover their presence. They attempt to return the fire, but are"
quickly surrounded. Chewie barks his anger as the troops take away
their weapons.
HAN Wait till I get my hands on those droids!
118. EXT. SPACE – BATTLE
A fierce battle rages as the Rebel cruisers attempt to move past the
Imperial ships and strike at the Death Stars. One of the Rebel ships
makes it through and starts its attack on one of the uncompleted
"battle stations, but the laser bolts fail to reach their target."
119. INT. REBEL CRUISER
Lando moves forward to the main viewing port as the surface of the
giant Death Star races by. He turns to the cruiser Captain.
LANDO The deflector shield is still up. They haven’t knocked out the
shield generator.
"CAPTAIN Even if more of our ships break through, they won’t be able"
to damage the Death Stars.
A huge blast rocks the ship.
CONTROLLER Two Star Destroyers are coming in!
LANDO There won’t be anything left of us if those shield generators
aren’t destroyed real quick.
120. INT. HAD ABBADON – TOMB’S DUNGEON
"Vader brings his lasersword down hard on his son, but Luke is able to"
"block his father’s blow. A quick sword exchange, and Luke forces"
"Vader back. Another exchange, and the Dark Lord recovers, pushing"
the young Jedi onto a small rock surrounded by the bubbling pool of
lava. Ben and the Emperor watch from the far side of the cavern.
EMPEROR He is every inch his father.
"BEN He is stronger than you imagine, and has many allies."
"EMPEROR Allies? If they are all as you, I have no concern. Once the"
"boy has killed his father, I will have him destroy you…"
"BEN Perhaps, but it will not save you. I have foreseen your death at"
the hands of Skywalker.
"EMPEROR But I have not, therefore it cannot be."
BEN Unless you can no longer see…
Luke fights back with all of his strength and drives his father back
across the tiny rocks. A crashing blow by Luke causes Vader to lose
"his balance and fall onto one of the small rock islands, his sword"
hand landing in the molten lava. His sword and part of his metal are
"melting away. Vader backs away from his son, expecting the death"
blow at any moment. But Luke hesitates as Ben and the Emperor
watch.
"EMPEROR Finish it, boy! It is the power of the Dark Side that you"
feel…
Luke lowers his lasersword.
"LUKE I cannot. I will not turn to the Dark Side. I only fight in selfdefense,"
not to do your Emperor’s bidding.
"With that, Luke extinguishes the lasersword and tosses it to Ben."
"LUKE If he is to be destroyed, you must do it."
121. EXT. FOREST – GUN EMPLACEMENT
"Han, Chewie, Wicket and Leia are led to an area in front of the"
control bunker. Several Stormtroopers rush up the ridge to where
Artoo and Threepio were last seen. They look around for traces of
where they might have gone. A familiar whistle is heard coming from
behind a large tree. The Stormtroopers move over to investigate.
They surround the two droids.
THREEPIO Hello.
"Suddenly, out of the trees swing a horde of Ewoks, yelling and"
"screaming as they land on the troops from behind, stabbing them with"
their spears. Several of the Ewoks heave a huge boulder from high in
"the trees; which lands with a loud thud on the walker’s head, and"
"bounces to the ground. A second and third boulder is heaved, one of"
"which hits the hatch, springing it open. A half dozen Ewoks jump onto"
"the giant war machine and pry open the hatch, fearlessly jumping into"
the machine with their spears ready.
"In the confusion, Han and company break away from their captors"
and join in the battle. The Ewoks cut down trees that fall on the
"walkers, and sends piles of logs toward the huge machines; which"
causes them to slip and fall. Han climbs a tree and swings down on
one of the walkers. He blasts open the hatch and subdues the walker
pilot. Chewie and Wicket swing onto another walker.
"Leia, Chief Chirpa and the other Ewoks charge the entrance to the"
"control bunker, but the alert Imperial troops manage to close the blast"
"door shutting out the Ewoks, as well as many of the Imperial scouts."
The Rebels become pinned down in front of the door.
LEIA We’ve got to get in there fast! They’ll be calling in
reinforcements!
"Chief Chirpa chatters away, not understanding what the Princess is"
saying.
122. INT. WALKER – COCKPIT
"Han works the controls of the giant walker, and it begins to move"
forward chasing the Imperial troops into the safety of the forest. Han
fires a large bolt at the retreating troops. A voice comes over the
com-link.
"LEIA Bring the walker over by the door, we need some help!"
"HAN Hang on, I’m on my way!"
123. INT. SECOND WALKER – COCKPIT
Chewie operates the controls of another walker as Wicket imitates
him on another control panel. The little Ewok flips a switch and the
cockpit lurches to one side. Chewie lets out a growl and bats the little
creature’s hands. Wicket lets out a squeal and jumps away from the
"control panel. Out the cockpit window, Imperial troops fire at the"
walker as it advances on them.
124. EXT. SPACE – DEATH STARS – REBEL STARSHIP
"Rebel cruisers dive on the Death Stars, blasting away with all of the"
firepower available. A huge Imperial Star Destroyer moves into the
conflict and blasts one of the Rebel cruisers away. It then moves to
"blast a second Rebel cruiser, and then another."
125. INT. REBEL CRUISER – BRIDGE
The bridge is rocked by laser blasts. Lando watches the battle out the
main viewing port as the Captain approaches him.
CAPTAIN Several Star Destroyers have moved in from the
planetside. Our cruisers are no match for theirs!
Lando bangs his fist on the control panel in frustration.
LANDO We’re too easy a target out here. There’s just no way to us to
get through that defense shield. Tell the Admiral that we’re going to
let them chase us out of the target area.
"CAPTAIN If we can draw them to the far side of the planet, we can"
easily outrace them back to the target.
"LANDO If they don’t blast that shield generator pretty quick, we’re not"
going to have enough of a strike group for it to make any difference.
I’d give anything to know what is going on down there with that gun!
126. CLEARING – GUN EMPLACEMENT
Random laser fire from the dense foliage keeps the small band of
Rebels pinned near the bunker entrance. Han and Chewie have
"backed the walkers up to the heavy metal door, and the Rebels have"
attached a long cable from the walker to a magnet on the door. Leia
speaks into her comlink.
LEIA We’re all set. Let them go.
"At that moment, out of the foliage come several more two-legged"
"walkers, and about a dozen of the scout speeder bikes. They attack"
the Rebels at the bunker entrance and in the captured walker. Han
and Chewie struggle to pull the bunker door.
Chewie and Wicket are having problems of their own. Two rocket
bikes circle the walker so close their own walker can’t fire on them.
The scouts blast away at the metal legs of the walker until one of the
joints collapses and the walker with the Wookiee and the Ewok goes
"crashing to the ground. The two Rebels are shaken, but unhurt, and"
manage to climb out of the burning machine.
Han maneuvers the walker back to the bunker door and Chewie
helps to reestablish the cable. The walker jerks forward in one last
attempt to yank the great metal door open. A loud ripping metallic
screech is heard and the entire back half of the walker falls off. Han
looks out of the gaping hole of his walker a little embarrassed. Leia
shakes her head. The fighting ends and the last of the Imperial scouts
flees into the forest.
Han takes a piece of the damaged walker and throws it down in
"frustration, then gets an idea. He yells down to Leia and the"
remaining Rebels.
HAN Get out of sight! Quick!
He goes over to the control panel and fiddles with the computer
readout. He begins to speak into the walker’s com-link using several
"different voices, while getting information from the computer."
HAN Ah…six twenty-one bring up your reinforcements. (another
"voice) This is six twenty-one, we’re moving up now…"
127. INT. CONTROL BUNKER – ION CANNON
"About a half-dozen Imperial scouts crows around the control panel,"
listening to the com-link.
"HAN (V.O.) Ahh…Commander Bough, move in with your"
"scouts. (another voice) Yes sir, we’ve got them on the run now…Look"
at them go!
A scout officer in the bunker smiles as the men cheer.
SCOUT OFFICER They’ve got ‘em…I wish we could see out there…
HAN (V.O.) Good work. Contact Admiral….ah…Veers and tell him
the Rebel resistance is broken. The gun here is secure. (another
"voice) Sir, could you have the scouts in the bunker come out here"
and give us a hand cleaning up?
SCOUT OFFICER We’re on our way out now!
128. EXT. BUNKER ENTRANCE – FOREST CLEARING
The Imperial scouts rush to the opening bunker door and exit into the
"glare of the sun. The scouts stop just outside the door. Puzzled, they"
"look around and see all the destruction, but no other Imperial troops."
They look up to see Han stick his head out of the damaged walker.
HAN Hi there.
"Before the scouts can reach for their guns, they realize they are"
surrounded by Ewoks. Leia rushes into the bunker. The Ewoks
proceed to tie up the Imperial troops as Han climbs down from the
walker. Artoo and Threepio make their way into the clearing.
129. INT. CONTROL BUNKER
"Han and Leia rush about, getting the ion cannon ready to fire. They"
watch the computer readout.
HAN It’s going to take a few moments to get the power up.
LEIA I just hope the fleet is still up there when it does.
130. INT. CRUISER – BRIDGE
"There are only a few Rebel ships left, and they are racing for their"
lives trying to reach the Death Stars before the Imperial Star
Destroyers. Lando plots their program on the computer display. The
Captain is with him.
"LANDO Captain, focus everything on the power core. When we reach"
"target range, let go with everything."
CAPTAIN What if the shields are still up? All the firepower in the fleet
couldn’t penetrate it.
LANDO We’re only going to get one more shot at it. If the shields are
"still up, we’ve lost."
131. INT. HAD ABBADON – TOMB’S DUNGEON
Lord Vader struggles to stand as Ben prods the Emperor onto the
same small island. Luke stands behind Ben and watches.
"EMPEROR You have become old and weak, Lord Vader. I will take"
care of this.
"The Emperor turns his back on Vader and faces the old Jedi, raising"
"his hands in the air, which causes lightning to strike at Ben."
"LUKE BEN, NO!"
"Luke leaps in front of his mentor, and raises his hand in defense. The"
"bolts are deflected by an invisible shield. Wherever a bolt hits, the"
image of Yoda momentarily appears at the point of impact.
EMPEROR Your Master in the netherworld cannot protect you for
long. You will turn to me or die.
"The lightning bolts become more intense, and Ben is knocked"
unconscious. Luke drops to his knees under the pressure.
EMPEROR This is the power of the Dark Side that you deny. Your
strength will never match it.
Luke struggles to remain conscious against the superior power of the
Emperor.
LUKE Yoda…
"EMPEROR Obi-Wan foresaw my destruction at your hands, young"
"Skywalker, but it seems his vision was clouded…Perhaps there is still"
"another Skywalker. Why can I not see, could the netherworld have"
influenced my perception? Another Skywalker…your father!
The Emperor turns around to see Lord Vader flying at him. The
"lightning bolts around Luke disappear as Vader hits the Emperor,"
knocking them both into the fiery lake of lava. The hideous screams
of the Emperor are soon muted. Luke struggles to his feet and stares
at the spot where his enemy and his father disappeared into the
cauldron of molten rock.
Ben puts his hand on the young Jedi’s shoulder.
BEN It is in Yoda’s hands now.
"[""In the rough draft…Ben explains that…if Vader becomes one with"
"the dark side of the Force, he will lose all identity. If he turns to the"
"good side, he will pass through the Netherworld and"" in the revised"
"rough draft, Yoda ""will rescue him before he becomes one with the"
"Force."" -L. Bouzerau, explanation from Star Wars The Annotated"
Screenplays page 300.]
LUKE He turned back to the good side.
"BEN Yes, he did."
132. INT. CONTROL BUNKER
The main computer readout in the ion cannon control bunker shows
the target entering the cross hairs.
"HAN Target ready. Stand by, ion control."
LEIA Fire.
The ion cannon fires a series of powerful laser bolts at the main
shield generator. It explodes across the surface of Had Abbadon.
133. EXT. SPACE – REBEL CRUISERS – DEATH STARS
"The Rebel cruisers descend on the half-constructed Death Star, firing"
proton torpedoes into the center of the super-structure. There is a
"series of explosions, culminating in a huge explosion that engulfs the"
"Death Star. In the distance, the second Death Star explodes in a"
great ball of flame.
134. INT. BRIDGE – REBEL CRUISER
A great cheer goes up among the Rebels. Lando and the Cruiser
Captain congratulate each other.
135. INT. ION CANNON CONTROL BUNKER
"Han lifts Leia off her feet and swings her around, laughing. Chewie"
"lifts Wicket high over his head. Teebo hugs Threepio, who pats him"
on the head. The little Ewok then rushes over and hugs Artoo.
136. INT. HAD ABBADON – HALLWAY TO THRONE ROOM
"The hallway is deserted as Luke and Ben wander, sadly thinking"
about what happened. The rumble of distant explosions is heard.
BEN It is over…
137. EXT. EWOK FOREST VILLAGE – NIGHT
"Ewoks and Rebels are singing, shouting and dancing around a huge"
bonfire. The joyous sounds of native drums and musical instruments
echoes through the forest.
Leia and Luke walk down a forest path some distance from the
"festivities. Following them are Han, Chewie and Lando and behind"
them are Artoo and Threepio. Luke and Leia are talking quietly. Han
shakes his head in amazement as he watches the two.
HAN Her brother! I just can’t believe it.
They stop at the edge of the clearing where the celebration is taking
place. Leia gives her newfound brother a great big hug. They are
quickly surrounded by Ewoks and friends. Leia turns and gives Han a
big hug and passionate kiss. Everyone cheers and yells as they all
"move closer to the bonfire. Sadly, Luke wanders back into the forest"
"alone. Leia starts to go after him, but is stopped by Han."
HAN He needs to be alone.
They turn back to the celebration.
[NEXT-TO-LAST PAGE MISSING - DETAILS IN FOLLOWING

"[""In the revised rough draft (Scene 138, Luke talks to Ben, and"
then)…Yoda suddenly appears as flesh and blood. His stay in the
Netherworld has been resolved since Vader has turned to the good
side. Yoda also has been able to prevent Vader from becoming one
"with the Force. Luke's father appears, and they all join the"
"celebration, except for Yoda, who watches them all from the side…"" -"
"L. Bouzerau, explanation from Star Wars The Annotated Screenplays"
page 320.]
139. CONTINUED
Threepio is carried on the shoulders of eight Ewoks in a litter. He is a
little confused and dismayed at all the attention he is getting. The
furry little Ewoks set the golden droid down a raised platform and bow
before him as the dancing continues. Several young female Ewoks
"place a garland of flowers around Threepio’s head, and he waves at"
the crowd.
"Quietly watching the festivities from the side is Yoda, the Jedi Master."
"He scans the crowd picking out Artoo, Threepio, Lando and Chewie,"
"Han and Leia, and finally Ben, Luke and his father. He lets out a great"
sigh.

Abrams and Michael Arndt No portion of this script may be performed, reproduced, or used by any means, or quoted or published in any medium without prior written consent. Based on characters created by George Lucas A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away... STAR WARS EPISODE VII THE FORCE AWAKENS Luke Skywalker has vanished. In his absence, the sinister FIRST ORDER has risen from the ashes of the Empire and will not rest until Skywalker, the last Jedi, has been destroyed. With the support of the REPUBLIC, General Leia Organa leads a brave RESISTANCE. She is desperate to find her brother Luke and gain his help in restoring peace and justice to the galaxy. Leia has sent her most daring pilot on a secret mission to Jakku, where an old ally has discovered a clue to Luke's whereabouts.... PAN across the star field to a bright moon. A RUMBLING is FELT. A VAST STAR DESTROYER -- unlike any we have seen -- HURTLES PAST US, of seemingly endless length, eclipsing the moon. After a long beat, FOUR TRANSPORT SHIPS fly from a hangar. We HOLD ON THEM NOW, as they fly off toward a distant planet. Jakku. MUSIC BUILDS AND WE... CUT TO BLACK. A GROWING ROAR of MEAN ENGINES -- gnarled RADIO CALLS, the SHUDDERING of a ship's hull. Then FLASHES OF LIGHT: for an instant we see a STORMTROOPER -- then BLACKNESS. Then ANOTHER STORMTROOPER, then it's gone. The FLICKERING CONTINUES until the LIGHTS ARE CONSTANT. We are in: INT. TROOP TRANSPORT VEHICLE - NIGHT TWENTY STORMTROOPERS. Holding on at attention, moving to the ship's rhythm, in the tense moments before a raid. A FILTERED COMMAND and they LOCK AND LOAD their heavy blaster rifles. The BRUTAL NOISE is replaced by SUDDEN, SHOCKING QUIET: EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT WIDE SHOT of a small, peaceful village. Distant sounds of native animals. A single wind chime. Suddenly a DROID RISES INTO FRAME, CLOSE: ROUND and SKITTERY, orange and white, this is BB-8. Focuses on something past camera. He BEEPS -- FAST, MORSE CODE-LIKE SOUNDS, clearly worried. Moves EVEN CLOSER TO CAMERA -- is MORE worried -- BEEPS more -- then TURNS AND ROLLS OFF FAST -- INT. LARGE HUT - NIGHT CLOSE ON A HAND: a small LEATHER SACK is placed in the palm. The hand closes. Another OLDER HAND covers it. In a primitive HUT, an old explorer, LOR SAN TEKKA, (rugged, kind) has handed the mysterious sack to POE DAMERON (32, in a pilot's jacket). Poe has charisma, a natural spark: LOR SAN TEKKA This will begin to make things right. I've traveled too far, and seen too much, to ignore the despair in the galaxy. Without the Jedi, there can be no balance in the Force. POE Well, because of you now we have a chance. The General's been after this for a long time. LOR SAN TEKKA ""The General."" To me, she's royalty. POE Well, she certainly is that. BB-8 ENTERS FRANTIC, BEEPS. Concerned, Poe turns to Lor San Tekka. POE (CONT'D) We've got company. EXT. LARGE HUT - NIGHT The men exit fast. Poe moves TO CAMERA, raises QUADNOCULARS. POE'S POV: LIGHTS on the horizon -- approaching ENEMY SHIPS. POE lowers the quadnocs -- PUSH IN ON HIS UNNERVED EYES. A GROWING, FRIGHTENING THUNDER. POE You have to hide. LOR SAN TEKKA You have to leave. Go! Poe turns to him. Conflicted. Finally nods, hurries off. BB-8 follows. EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT TRACK FAST with Poe as he and BB-8 hurry through the village, various ARMED VILLAGERS taking position, prepared to defend. EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT A ROAR of WIND and DUST: the TRANSPORTS LAND. Stormtroopers come out FIRING BLASTERS -- the VILLAGERS FIRE BACK -- many are HIT! EXT. RISE ADJACENT TO VILLAGE - NIGHT Poe runs to an X-WING fighter, parked at a distance from the village, hidden behind a ROCK OUTCROPPING. POE Come on, BB-8! Hurry! Poe sends BB-8 into the droid socket / co-pilot seat -- he moves to the cockpit -- the CONTROLS COME TO LIFE. As the CANOPY CLOSES, Poe shoots a quick look back: the ENEMY ARRIVES IN THE DISTANCE. Poe urgently works the controls -- BB-8 BEEPS. The X-WING LANDING LIGHTS COME ON, ENGINES WHINE TO LIFE! But just then: Poe's ship is suddenly HIT BY BLASTERFIRE! Poe turns to look: two STORMTROOPERS CHARGE HIS WAY, FIRING! POE (CONT'D) I see 'em! BB-8 BEEPS nervously as Poe GRABS HIS CONTROLS and FIRES AT THEM, using the X-wing's drop-down antipersonnel blaster! The two Troopers are BLOWN AWAY in the large BLAST HITS! Poe tries to start the ship now, but the ENGINES SPUTTER. Concerned, he opens his canopy, jumps down, moves to the back of his ship: BAD DAMAGE ON THE REAR ENGINE PANEL. They're in trouble. EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT Lor San Tekka moves sadly through the village as STORMTROOPERS wielding FLAME THROWERS destroy structures. Surrendering Villagers are ROUNDED UP. Penned ANIMALS panic. EXT. RISE ADJACENT TO THE VILLAGE - NIGHT Back at the X-wing, Poe kneels beneath his ship, pulls from the leather sack a SMALL, OLD ARTIFACT which he inserts into BB-8 -- the droid's MULTI-READER ENVELOPS it. POE You take this. It's safer with you than it is with me. You get as far away from here as you can. Do you hear me? (BB-8 BEEPS, hesitates) I'll come back for you! It will be alright. BB-8 watches Poe run off. BEEP-WHINES nervously, then turns and heads off. Turns back once to look at Poe, then ROLLS AWAY. Poe uses his blaster rifle to fire at incoming troopers from cover. EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT The Troopers and villagers in battle -- as one Trooper is HIT and goes down. Another -- OUR TROOPER -- KNEELS to help. The hit trooper raises a torn, bloody glove -- his HUMAN HAND visible -- and MARKS OUR STORMTROOPER'S MASK WITH BLOOD just before he dies. Our Trooper, stands -- overwhelmed by the battle. AN IMPOSING SHUTTLE CRAFT -- VERTICAL WINGSPAN 90 FEET TALL -- LANDS NEAR THE TRANSPORT VEHICLES. The shuttle craft door OPENS -- through the wind and smoke, KYLO REN exits the ship: a TALL, DARK FIGURE, he strides through the chaos toward San Tekka. A senior Trooper moves to our blood-marked Trooper, and orders him: SENIOR TROOPER Stay here. Our Trooper nods. Kylo Ren stops before the outraged Lor San Tekka, dwarfing him. Only now does it become apparent that Kylo Ren wears a DARK MASK, marked by battle. Inset metal lines reflect FIRE. KYLO REN Look how old you've become. LOR SAN TEKKA Something far worse has happened to you. Our blood-marked TROOPER is placed in line with other stormtroopers. KYLO REN You know what I've come for. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: LOR SAN TEKKA I know where you come from. Before you called yourself Kylo Ren. KYLO REN The map to Skywalker. We know you've found it, and now you're going to give it to the First Order. Adjacent to the village, Poe enters frame -- sees the Ren/San Tekka exchange continue. LOR SAN TEKKA The First Order rose from the dark side... you did not. KYLO REN I'll show you the dark side. LOR SAN TEKKA You may try, but you cannot deny the truth that is your family. Suddenly Kylo Ren raises his LIGHTSABER -- IGNITES IT -- PERPENDICULAR SMALLER BLADES AT THE HILT, A UNIQUE BUZZ -- YELLOW/RED ENERGY, SPITTING SPARKS AND SMOKE -- KYLO REN You're so right. And as he RIPS IT DOWN ACROSS SAN TEKKA! Poe, RUNNING, SEES THIS AND YELLS, AIMS HIS BLASTER AND FIRES AT KYLO REN! Instantly: Kylo Ren RAISES HIS HAND -- POE'S BLAST FREEZES -- THE BOLT OF ENERGY STRAINING AND VIBRATING IN MID AIR! Kylo Ren sees Poe, who suddenly CANNOT MOVE, but strains to. He is grabbed by Stormtroopers who drag him past the VIBRATING, FROZEN BLAST, to Kylo Ren. A Stormtrooper begins a brutal PAT DOWN. Kylo Ren moves closer. Poe just glares. The Stormtrooper KICKS OUT Poe's legs -- he lands hard on his knees. Kylo Ren kneels to look at Poe. POE So who talks first? You talk first? KYLO REN The old man gave it to you. POE (indicates Kylo's mask) It's just very hard to understand you with all the... (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: KYLO REN (to troopers) Search him. POE ... Apparatus. The Troopers roughly pull Poe away. A Stormtrooper begins a brutal PAT DOWN. Kylo Ren moves closer. Poe just glares as the pat down ends. STORMTROOPER #1 Nothing, sir. KYLO REN Put him on board. Kylo Ren regards the Stormtroopers with the rounded up Villagers, then turns to the CHROME-SKINNED, FEMALE BLACKCAPED HEAD STORMTROOPER, CAPTAIN PHASMA. CAPTAIN PHASMA Sir, the villagers. KYLO REN Kill them all. Phasma nods, steps forward: CAPTAIN PHASMA On my command! The Troopers, including OURS, aim at the Villagers. CAPTAIN PHASMA (CONT'D) Fire! Poe is roughly PULLED into a transport ship, the ramp LIFTS. All around our Trooper BLASTERFIRE ERUPTS -- but we're WIDE ENOUGH to see he ISN'T FIRING. PUSH IN until the FIRING STOPS. All the Stormtroopers SPREAD OUT TO SEARCH -- except ours. Kylo Ren heads back toward his ship. But then he STOPS. Feels something. TURNS AND LOOKS AT OUR STORMTROOPER for a LONG MOMENT. Our Trooper can barely meet his gaze; knows he's doomed. Kylo Ren then heads off -- passes the FROZEN BLAST, which, after a beat, GOES FREE AND SLAMS INTO A NEARBY STRUCTURE, scaring the hell out of our Stormtrooper. EXT. EDGE OF JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT A Stormtrooper climbs down from the cockpit of Poe's X-wing, backs away: (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: STORMTROOPER #2 Nothing here. Go ahead! Three other Stormtroopers FIRE LASER CANNONS at the X-wing -- destroying the ship in a LARGE EXPLOSION. EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT BB-8 rolls across the sand, looks back: the X-wing FIREBALL. BB-8, afraid, continues on his own in a mysterious, dark desert. We see a FORM -- an animal, its RED EYES LIFTING from the sand, watching the rolling droid, who just keeps going. In a WIDE SHOT, we HEAR HIM BEEPING to himself, lonely and frightened. EXT. SPACE - NIGHT With the SANDY PLANET OF JAKKU as backdrop, Troop Transports and Kylo Ren's Shuttle approach a massive STAR DESTROYER. INT. STAR DESTROYER HANGAR - NIGHT Poe, shackled, is ushered from the transport through the hangar. He is awed by the imposing space. POE All right. All right! Our Stormtrooper passes, moves fast: INT. TROOP TRANSPORT VEHICLE - NIGHT Our Stormtrooper enters the dark, vehicle. He removes his helmet. His head comes up and we PUSH IN ON HIS FACE FOR THE FIRST TIME. This is FN-2187. He is 23, likable. But in this moment, terrified, desperate. After a beat, behind him, CAPTAIN PHASMA enters. FN-2187 knows he's in trouble. CAPTAIN PHASMA FN-2187. Submit your blaster for inspection. FN-2187 Yes, Captain. CAPTAIN PHASMA And who gave you permission to remove that helmet? FN-2187 I'm sorry, Captain. CAPTAIN PHASMA Report to my division at once. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: Phasma heads off. Shattered, FN-2187 replaces his helmet. CUT TO: INT. JUNKED VESSEL CORRIDOR - DAY A metal sheet is pulled open to reveal the wrapped up face of A SCAVENGER, perhaps alien, in GOGGLES, FACE MASK and GLOVES. Backpack with a STAFF strapped to it. Uses TOOLS to remove various MECHANISMS from inside the wall. We are in an upside-down, canted CORRIDOR. The Scavenger finds a valuable piece, drops it in a SATCHEL. Swings the bag back and begins CLIMBING DOWN on a cable, between treacherous WALLS OF MACHINERY, headed to: INT. JUNKED VESSEL - LARGER SPACE - LATER Alone and tiny in this massive, sideways wreck, the Scavenger descends, climbing down a two-hundred foot-long cable. LANDS HARD onto rusty metal. INT. JUNKED VESSEL - ENGINES - DAY The Scavenger carries the satchel and another large, found piece, over enormous pipes in the vast space, heads through the dust toward a distant SLIT OF SUNLIGHT. EXT. JUNKED VESSEL ENGINE - DAY The Scavenger arrives from the darkness and pulls off goggles and gear, revealing the grimy face of a beautiful, young WOMAN. This is REY, 19. She opens her canteen, shakes out the two final drops into her mouth. HITS THE SIDE of the canteen again and again for whatever she can get. CUT WIDE: Rey is rendered minuscule, standing at the bottom of an EPIC ENGINE OF A DECAYING, CRASHED STAR DESTROYER -- DISTANT SOUND of her canteen-hitting. She sets her things on a piece of sheet metal and sits next to it, sliding down the sand dune. She RIDES DOWN THE MOUNTAIN OF SAND. WE HOLD FOR A LONG TIME, looking down, as she recedes from us, toward the distant SALT FLATS below. Random SCATTERED DEBRIS. Her SPEEDER, tiny from here. Rey moves to her junker SPEEDER, jumps on, fires the sputtery engine and DRIVES OFF. EXT. DESERT - SPACESHIP GRAVEYARD - DAY Rey races along the desert floor: a GRAVEYARD OF CRASHED SPACESHIPS. EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY Rey's speeder PASSES us, heading for a dusty, desert town. Refueling, small trade, scavengers. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: CRASH! Rey's sack carrying her heavy FOUND OBJECTS hits the sand. Working like a tough seaman, Rey hauls the sack from her speeder toward the town. EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - CLEANING TABLE - DAY TIGHT ON REY'S HANDS as she SCRUBS CLEAN her day's salvage. Rey glances up: she looks at an old woman, also cleaning some salvage. Rey watches her, gets lost in the simple moment. A small, passing alien UNDERLING barks something to her in another language. She returns to work. INT. NIIMA TRADING STRUCTURE - DAY Rey looks up to a SERVICE WINDOW: two feet above her, behind a protective screen, is her boss, UNKAR PLUTT (50, blobfish, unclean). He examines her pieces. Then he offers: UNKAR What you've brought me today is worth... Hmmm... One quarter portion. Though disappointed, Rey barely shows it. She nods thanks. Unkar pushes through his transfer drawer a SEALED PACKET: DRIED GREEN MEAT in one section, BEIGE POWDER in another. She takes it. She swallows her resentment and heads off. EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY The IMMENSE SETTING SUN against the FLAT TERRAIN. Rey's SPEEDER races, almost insignificant, across frame. INT. REY'S DWELLING - DAY She SCRATCHES MARKS into the rusty wall. Another MARK; another DAY. And there are THOUSANDS of marks. A SIZZLING SOUND over: A DRIED DESERT FLOWER in a rusty ENGINE PIECE. A rough, stuffed HANDMADE DOLL, made from what looks like orange Rebellion flight suit material and twine. Rey's lonely, ramshackle dwelling. Everything reclaimed. She cooks for one. Does everything for one. She opens the POWDER, moves to the makeshift WOK, where the GREEN MEAT SIZZLES. Pours the powder into milky WATER in a tin. Stirs it. It GROWS INTO A LOAF as she puts the meat on an old plate. Grabs the loaf. EXT. REY'S DWELLING - DUSK Rey sits, eats like a starving child. Every last drop. Licks the metal plate. Looks out at the horizon. A single silent ship heads off, a shimmering, thin contrail. She wipes her mouth. Picks up an old, broken REBELLION HELMET. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: Puts it on, just 'cause. WIDE SHOT of Rey sitting, alone and isolated, on the leg of an ANCIENT, FALLEN AT-AT in which she lives. Then, a distant ELECTRONIC SQUEAL -- instantly she's up, helmet too big, she rips it off. Hears ANOTHER BEEPING SQUEAL. She hurries to her QUARTERSTAFF and runs off. Rey climbs a dune. RISE WITH HER, revealing BB-8, caught in a NET but fighting back, being held by a TEEDO (a small, brutish desert tyrant), who rides a LUGGABEAST. The teedo YELLS at BB-8, who BEEPS madly, struggling to free himself. Rey watches this injustice for a beat, finally YELLING OUT: REY Tal'ama parqual! The Teedo and BB-8 STOP, GO SILENT, turn to her. REY (CONT'D) Parqual zatana! A half beat and the Teedo YELLS SOMETHING BACK, threatening. BB-8's head swivels to him, then back to Rey, like watching a tennis match. Rey angrily moves to them, pulling a knife from her pouch. Rey starts CUTTING BB-8 out of the netting. The Teedo freaks out, YELLING. Rey suddenly stands, turns to the Teedo and says, fiercely: REY (CONT'D) NOMA. The Teedo barks a sort of ""AHHHHH!"" (As if to say, ""GO TO HELL!""), Then heads off on his beast. This prompts BB-8 to start BEEP-YELLING at the departing bully, provocatively. REY (CONT'D) Shhhh. BB-8 quiets instantly. The two watch the Teedo head off. Finally, BB-8 BEEPS a question. She KNEELS to him. REY (CONT'D) That's just Teedo. Wants you for parts. He has no respect for anyone. Your antenna's bent. (considers BB-8 for the first time, straightens the antenna) Where do you come from? (BB-8 BEEPS) Classified. Really? Me too. Big secret. (points to horizon) Niima Outpost is that way, stay off Kelvin Ridge. (MORE) (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: REY (CONT'D) Keep away from the Sinking Fields in the north, you'll drown in the sand. (stands, heads off) BB-8 starts after her, BEEPS. She turns sharply, he stops. REY (CONT'D) Don't follow me. Town is that way. (he BEEPS again) No! She heads off again. Finally he BEEPS to her -- something SWEET this time. That he is alone, scared, has no one else. This makes her stop. She turns and looks at him. Not liking him. But a gesture of her head says, reluctantly, ""Come on."" BB-8 quickly moves to her. They head off together. REY (CONT'D) In the morning, you go. (he BEEPS) You're welcome. The two disappear behind a dune. EXT. STAR DESTROYER - DAY Three TIE fighters head to the massive ship high above Jakku. INT. STAR DESTROYER HOLDING CELL - DAY POE, shackled to a chair, BEATEN, wakes up. KYLO REN I had no idea we had the best pilot in the Resistance on board. Comfortable? Through battered lips: POE Not really. KYLO REN I'm impressed. No one has been able to get out of you what you did with the map. POE Might wanna rethink your technique. Kylo Ren says nothing, reaches out to him. Poe flinches in the chair as Kylo Ren reaches for his face, not touching him. Poe is soon in agony, remains in horrible silence -- KYLO REN Where is it? (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: POE The Resistance will not be intimidated by you. KYLO REN Where... is it? Poe can't take it -- he BEGINS TO SCREAM and we CUT TO: INT. STAR DESTROYER CORRIDOR - DAY WHOOOSH! The cell door SLIDES UP. Kylo Ren exits, fierce, confronts GENERAL HUX (34, scary) who awaits him: KYLO REN It's in a droid. A BB unit. GENERAL HUX Well then. If it's on Jakku, we'll soon have it. KYLO REN I leave that to you. EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY BB-8 is dropped to the sand. REY Don't give up. He still might show up. Whoever it is you're waiting for. Classified. I know all about waiting. BB-8 BEEPTALKS a question. REY (CONT'D) For my family. They'll be back. One day. Come on. She tries to force a smile, but can't, really. She heads off. BB-8 BEEPS... then heads after her. INT. NIIMA TRADING STRUCTURE - DAY Rey stands with BB-8 in front of Unkar Plutt, at his window. He reviews her goods. He glances quickly at BB-8. UNKAR These five pieces are worth... Let me see here... One half portion. REY (objects) Last week they were a half portion each. She hates him. He leans forward. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: UNKAR What about the droid? REY What about him? UNKAR I'll pay for him. BB-8 doesn't like this at all. Rey is awkward, but curious. UNKAR (CONT'D) Sixty portions. CLOSE ON HER. Stunned. Literally hungry for this amount of food, her stomach practically rumbles. BB-8 sees her interest and BEEPS furiously, not liking this conversation at all. She looks at Unkar. Looks down at BB-8. Considers it all. Finally, she hears herself say: REY Actually... the droid's not for sale. (to BB-8) Come on. Unkar furious. Rey, then BB-8, head out. Recovering, Unkar watches her go with dark eyes. He picks up a communicator: UNKAR Follow the girl and get that droid. He SLAMS the service window door SHUT. INT. STAR DESTROYER HOLDING CELL - DAY The cell door WHOOSHES OPEN -- a STORMTROOPER enters. Poe remains shackled, worse for wear. A TROOPER GUARD here. STORMTROOPER Ren wants the prisoner. TIGHT ON POE, in pain, drained, as the Guard unshackles him. INT. STAR DESTROYER CORRIDOR - DAY An exhausted, handcuffed Poe is walked down the corridor by the Stormtrooper, who holds a blaster at Poe's body. STORMTROOPER Turn here. Poe turns into a narrow passageway -- INT. STAR DESTROYER NARROW PASSAGEWAY - DAY Heading down the narrow hall the Stormtrooper stops Poe. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: STORMTROOPER Listen carefully: you do exactly as I say, I can get you out of here. POE (coming to) If -- what--? The Stormtrooper pulls off his helmet: IT IS FN-2187. FN-2187 This is a rescue, I'm helping you escape. Can you fly a TIE fighter? POE You with the Resistance--?! FN-2187 What? (that's crazy) No no no! I'm breaking you out. Can you fly a TIE fighter? POE I can fly anything. Why, why are you helping me? FN-2187 Because it's the right thing to do. POE (it hits him) You need a pilot. FN-2187 I need a pilot. And Poe, seeing this is for real, smiles a hero's smile. POE We're gonna do this. FN-2187 (unsure but hopeful) ... Yeah? INT. STAR DESTROYER HANGAR - DAY WIDE SHOT ESTABLISHING the hangar. Find FN-2187, again masked, walking with Poe. By all appearances he's escorting a prisoner. A group of OFFICERS passes in the opposite direction. FN-2187 Okay, stay calm, stay calm. POE I am calm. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: FN-2187 I'm talking to myself. (beat) Not yet. Okay, go. This way. FN-2187 walks quickly toward the far wall -- Poe follows -- up the stairs to a two-man SPECIAL FORCES TIE FIGHTER -- INT. TIE FIGHTER - DAY FN-2187 and Poe (wincing, sore) drop into the back-to-back cockpit. FN-2187 pulls off his helmet as Poe removes his cuffs and jacket, fires up the ship with excitement. POE I always wanted to fly one of these things. Can ya shoot? FN-2187 Blasters, I can! POE Okay, same principal! Use the toggle on the left to switch between missiles, cannons, and mag pulse -- use the site on the right to aim, triggers to fire! FN-2187 This is very complicated FWOOOOOOM! The TIE FIGHTER LURCHES FORWARD -- POE I can fix this. INT. HANGAR SIX CONTROL ROOM - DAY WIDE: see the ship STRUGGLE TO RISE, CABLES connected to it -- PULL BACK FAST to REVEAL we're inside the main control room. STAR DESTROYER TECHNICIAN We have an unsanctioned departure from bay two. WHIP TO a FIRST ORDER COLONEL, who responds: FIRST ORDER COLONEL Alert General Hux and stop that fighter. INT.

HANGAR SIX CONTROL ROOM - DAY THE WINDOWS ARE BLOWN IN BY LASER BLASTS! INT. TIE FIGHTER COCKPIT - DAY POE I got it! EXT. STAR DESTROYER - DAY The TIE Fighter blasts from the ship -- INT. TIE FIGHTER - DAY Poe pilots -- amazed, almost enjoying it. POE Woooahhh! This thing really moves. All right, we gotta take out as many cannons as we can or we're not gonna get very far! FN-2187 All right! POE I'm gonna get us in position, just stay sharp! EXT. STAR DESTROYER - DAY The TIE Fighter ARCS BACK, DIVES THROUGH THE OPENING BETWEEN THE LEVELS OF THE MASSIVE SHIP, then FLIES DOWN AND BACK, along the ship's belly -- INT. TIE FIGHTER - DAY Poe flies toward the CANONS -- POE Up ahead! Up ahead! You see it? I've got us dead centered. It's a clean shot. FN-2187 Okay, got it. FN-2187 gets a target, FIRES! EXT. STAR DESTROYER - DAY LASERS BLAST from the TIE Fighter -- A SERIES OF CANNONS EXPLODE! Our TIE Fighter SLICES THROUGH the debris! INT. TIE FIGHTER - DAY FN-2187 YELLS in celebration: FN-2187 YES! You see that?! DID YOU SEE THAT? POE I saw it! Hey, what's your name? FN-2187 FN-2187! Poe reacts, this tells him volumes about FN-2187's history. POE FN-whaa? FN-2187 That's the only name they ever gave me! POE Well I ain't using it! FN, huh? Finn. I'm gonna call you Finn! That all right? Even in the madness, Finn can't suppress his smile. FINN ""Finn."" Yeah, ""Finn"", I like that! I like that! POE I'm Poe. Poe Dameron. FINN Good to meet you, Poe! POE Good to meet you too, Finn! INT. STAR DESTROYER MAIN BRIDGE - DAY General Hux looks over the shoulder of LIEUTENANT MITAKA, at a console. LIEUTENANT MITAKA Sir, they've taken out our turbolasers-- GENERAL HUX Use the ventral cannons. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: LIEUTENANT MITAKA Yes, sir. Bringing them online -- KYLO REN (O.S.) General Hux. Is it the Resistance pilot? Hux turns: Kylo Ren enters fast, looms large, angry. GENERAL HUX Yes, and he had help. (vexed) From one of our own. PUSH IN ON REN as Hux says: GENERAL HUX (CONT'D) We're checking the registers now to identify which Stormtrooper it was. KYLO REN ... The one from the village. FN2187. Hux is unnerved that Ren knows -- he chalks it up to Ren's Force ability. Kylo Ren heads off. LIEUTENANT MITAKA Sir. Ventral cannons hot. GENERAL HUX Fire. EXT. STAR DESTROYER - DAY Massive WARHEAD LAUNCHERS SPIN and FIRE BLASTS toward the TIE fighter, which flies EVASIVE MANEUVERS -- most blasts hit the DEBRIS from the TURBOLASER DESTRUCTION. The TIE fighter then PULLS A BIG TURN, BACK TOWARD JAKKU, THE SANDY PLANET WHERE POE LEFT BB-8. INT. TIE FIGHTER - DAY POE One's coming towards you. My right, your left. Do you see it? FINN Hold on! I see it! POE Nice shot. Finn looks up suddenly in alarm -- FINN Where are you going? (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: POE We're going back to Jakku. That's where. FINN No no no! We can't go back to Jakku! We need to get outta this system! NEAR-MISS LASER BLASTS as Poe pilots aggressively. POE I got to get to my droid before the First Order does! FINN What - a droid?! POE That's right. He's a BB unit! Orange and white: one of a kind. FINN I don't care what color he is! No droid can be that important! POE This one is, pal. FINN We need to get as far away from the First Order as we can! We go back to Jakku, we die! POE That droid's got a map that leads straight to Luke Skywalker! FINN Oh, you gotta be kidding me!!! I-- Suddenly BAM! THEY ARE HIT! EXT. TIE FIGHTER - DAY The TIE FIGHTER SPARKS AND SMOKES, SPIRALING out of control toward the surface of Jakku! INT. STAR DESTROYER MAIN BRIDGE - DAY Captain Phasma and General Hux stand before a holographic projection detailing FN-2187's service records. CAPTAIN PHASMA FN-2187 reported to my division, was evaluated and sent to Reconditioning. GENERAL HUX No prior signs of non-conformity? (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: CAPTAIN PHASMA This was his first offense. A technician checks her readings, reports to General Hux. TECHNICIAN #1 General. They've been hit. GENERAL HUX Destroyed? TECHNICIAN #1 (getting readings) Disabled. They were headed back to Jakku -- the fighter's projected to crash in the Goazon badlands. GENERAL HUX They were going back for the droid -- send a squad to the wreckage. EXT. JAKKU DESERT - DAY TIGHT ON FINN'S FACE: His EYES OPEN. He goes from unconscious to terrified, fast. He sits up, looks around. CUT BACK WIDE: he sits in the middle of an EPIC DESERT, DUNES FOREVER. A BLACK CHUTE blows in the wind behind him, scattered debris. Then he sees, over distant dunes, RISING BLACK SMOKE. He gets up -- moves toward it, calling out: FINN Poe! Poe! Finn scrambles over the massive dune to the TIE FIGHTER, SMOKING AND ON FIRE, small debris around it. He thinks he sees POE'S ARM -- he pulls on it, but it's JUST POE'S JACKET. He throws that off and tries to find a way in -- even a way to LOOK INSIDE, but the smoke and heat make it impossible. FINN (CONT'D) Poe!!! POE! Suddenly the ship BEGINS TO SINK -- like it's being CONSUMED INTO QUICKSAND -- Finn is slipping in too -- FINN (CONT'D) POE!!! POE!!! It becomes clear fast: if Finn doesn't get away, he's gonna get sucked in too! So Finn scampers away from the TIE FIGHTER as it SINKS INTO THE SAND! We're in the Sinking Fields. A few moments and IT'S GONE. Finn's out of breath. Horrified. Then A GIANT EXPLOSION ERUPTS FROM below, SENDING SAND AND DEBRIS EVERYWHERE! Finn sees this, disoriented, scared, exhausted and defeated. And all alone. EXT. DESERT - DAY ENDLESS DUNES BEHIND HIM, Finn walks, removing pieces of his Stormtrooper gear, using Poe's FLIGHT JACKET for shade. EXT. DESERT - DAY Exhausted, Finn continues his trek across the endless, sandy nothingness. EXT. DESERT - DAY Finn, parched and losing hope, he walks to the edge of a massive dune, looks out into the epic valley below. Miles ahead: NIIMA OUTPOST. INT. STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE - DAY General Hux and Kylo Ren walk the length of the bridge. GENERAL HUX Supreme Leader Snoke was explicit. Capture the droid if we can, but destroy it if we must. KYLO REN How capable are your soldiers, General? GENERAL HUX (with vitriol) I won't have you question my methods. KYLO REN They're obviously skilled at committing high treason. Perhaps Leader Snoke should consider using a clone army. GENERAL HUX (you son-of-a-bitch) My men are exceptionally trained -- programmed from birth-- KYLO REN Then they should have no problem retrieving the droid. Unharmed. GENERAL HUX Careful, Ren. That your ""personal interests"" not interfere with orders from Leader Snoke. KYLO REN I want that map. For your sake, I suggest you get it. Ren heads off. Hux hates him. EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY Sun-scorched and exhausted, Finn stumbles out of the desert into the Outpost. In a heatstroke daze he moves past enormous old SHIP PARTS, MERCHANTS, SCAVENGERS and TENTED STALLS. FINN Water... water... water.. He sees a WATER TROUGH where a filthy, slobbering hippo-like creature (a HAPPABORE) DRINKS. Finn moves to it, uses his hands to desperately DRINK the filthy water. After a couple swallows he SPITS IT OUT, disgusted. FINN (CONT'D) -- Awgh, GAH! But he's parched and immediately RETURNS FOR MORE. ACROSS THE MARKETPLACE, REY kneels with an emphatically BEEPING BB-8. Just then, TWO of UNKAR'S THUGS approach and stop her. One clearly tells her that they're taking the droid. BB-8 reacts nervously as Rey resists them -- one pulls a SACK over BB-8 while the other grabs Rey's arm -- in the tussle, Rey KNOCKS OVER METAL URNS for sale -- Finn, still drinking, is PUSHED OVER by the happabore. He falls to the ground, then turns to look when he HEARS CRASHING. He sees, through the tents, REY FIGHTING. He moves UP CLOSER to help this young woman being accosted -- but he STOPS when Rey begins to FIGHT BACK -- scrappy and feral, she KICKS, BITES and HITS. Finn is taken aback as she DEFEATS the attackers, who hit the sand, hard. Finn just watches, stunned. Rey moves to the COVERED BB-8 -- PULLS THE SACK OFF OF HIM. Finn cannot believe his eyes. IT'S POE'S DROID! Rey talks to BB-8, who, nervous now, looks around and... SEES FINN! BB-8 STARTS BEEPING like crazy. Then something insane happens: REY LOOKS AT FINN. REY (To BB-8) Who? Him? Finn is confused. Rey stands, staring at Finn, defiant. Finn can feel trouble coming -- and Rey begins CHARGING AT HIM, quarterstaff in hand. Realizing he's the target, Finn begins to RUN -- away from her, through the tent marketplace. Rey goes after him -- he turns a corner -- then another -- then BAM! She's got ahead of him and SLAMS HIM TO THE GROUND WITH HER STAFF! Finn is on his back, out of breath and freaked out. She holds the staff on him threateningly: REY What's your hurry, thief? FINN What--?! Thief? BB-8 ROLLS UP FAST, MOVES TO FINN -- a WELDING ARM TELESCOPES FROM HIS BODY AND SHOCKS FINN! FINN (CONT'D) OW! HEY! What?! REY The jacket! This droid says you stole it! FINN I've had a pretty messed up day, alright?! So I'd appreciate it you stop accusing me -- OW!!! (BB-8 has ZAPPED him again) STOP IT! REY Where'd you get it? It belongs to his master. Finn looks at her -- then the agitated droid, Finn's mind racing. He puts it all together. Frustrated, but sighs heavily, needing to respond somehow. So he makes a hard decision: to tell the truth. FINN It belonged to Poe Dameron. That was his name, right? Rey and BB-8 react, surprised and wanting more. FINN (CONT'D) He was captured... by the First Order! I helped him escape but our ship crashed. (reliving it) Poe didn't make it. (sees BB-8 is sad, rolls off) Look, I tried to help him. I'm sorry... BB-8 heads off to the side, depressed. Rey watches BB-8, then considers Finn again. Says, a bit impressed: REY So you're with the Resistance? (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: Finn's mind races again. He makes an easy decision: to lie. FINN Obviously. Yes. I am. I'm with the Resistance, yeah. (whispers) I'm with the Resistance. Rey lowers her staff, Finn stands. Rey studies him: REY I've never met a Resistance fighter before. FINN Well, this is what we look like. Some of us. Others look different. REY BB-8 says he's on a secret mission, he has to get back to your base. FINN Apparently he's carrying a map that leads to Luke Skywalker, and everyone's after it. She turns to him, concerned, curious. And asks: REY Luke Skywalker? I thought he was a myth. Just then BB-8 BEEPS MADLY at something he sees. REY (CONT'D) What is it? Rey moves to him, peeks around a tent corner. Now Finn moves to see: at a distance, TWO STORMTROOPERS TALKING TO UNKAR'S THUGS -- who POINT THEIR WAY! Finn urgently grabs her hand and heads for the tents: REY (CONT'D) (re: her hand) What are you doing?! FINN Come on! Suddenly LASER BLASTS RIP PAST THEM, HIT THE CLEANING UNIT, SPEWING STEAM! Rey SCREAMS -- MORE BLASTS as they run! EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY Finn and Rey holding hands, the three race, ZIGZAGGING through a maze of tents: (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: FINN Come on, BB-8! REY Let go of me! FINN No, we gotta move! REY (pulls her hand back) I know how to run without you holding my hand! BB-8 stay close! This way! Now Finn and BB-8 follow Rey -- ANOTHER BLAST just missing them! They disappear through a tent. TRACK FAST WITH STORMTROOPERS, through the tent maze. They come out of a tent, HAVING MOMENTARILY LOST THEIR TARGET. STORMTROOPER Call in the air strike! REY, FINN AND BB-8 duck into another tent: INT. NIIMA OUTPOST - TENT - DAY Rey, Finn and BB-8 move through RUSTY WARES and take cover. Quiet, urgent: REY They're shooting at both of us! FINN Yeah, they saw you with me! You're marked! REY Well, thanks for that! FINN I'm not the one who chased you down with a stick! Does anyone have blasters around here?! REY (to BB-8) Are you okay? Finn QUIETS HER WITH A GESTURE, HEARING SOMETHING. PUSH IN ON FINN -- whatever he hears alarms him greatly -- he GRABS HER HAND AGAIN -- PULLS HER AWAY -- REY (CONT'D) Stop taking my hand! EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - TENT - DAY Finn pulls Rey from the tent -- BB-8 FOLLOWS -- As they race from the tent a TIE FIGHTER SCREAMS INTO VIEW FROM BEHIND THE TENTS! A SECOND FOLLOWS CLOSE BEHIND. IT FIRES AT THEM -- A MASSIVE BLAST SENDS REY AND FINN FLYING -- BB-8 ROLLING! WIDE SHOT: TWO TIE FIGHTERS SCREAM OVER the town, the EXPLOSION throws sand and debris fifty feet into the air. Rey is thrown HARD to the ground -- she is rattled, truly afraid. Then she turns: FINN lies nearby, unconscious. Suddenly afraid, she scrambles to him, rolls him over. BB-8 ROLLS OVER, BEEPING in concern. REY Hey! As Finn comes to, he sees her. Through his fog: FINN -- Are you okay? And that very question touches her -- having never in her life been asked it. REY Yeah. (extends her hand) Follow me. Grateful, Finn takes it. They're off. LOCALS run amok as TIE fighters DIVE BOMB. REY, Finn and BB8 SPRINT, BLASTER EXPLOSIONS GET CLOSER AND CLOSER! EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - SPACEPORT - DAY Rey, STAFF strapped to her back, leads the way as she, Finn and BB-8 race into the spaceport. Finn glances back: TWO TIE FIGHTERS BANK their return. They YELL: FINN We can't outrun them! Rey POINTS to a parked, four-engine SHIP ahead: REY We might in that quad-jumper! FINN We need a pilot! REY We've got one! (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: FINN You?! (then, indicates one OFF-CAMERA) What about that ship? REY That one's garbage! They run for the JUMPER but the passing TIE FIGHTERS FIRE AT IT, BLOWING IT APART IN A HUGE FLAME BALL! Rey, coming to a quick stop, RIGHT UP TO CAMERA: REY (CONT'D) The garbage'll do! She turns and runs back -- Finn and BB-8 follow as they all run toward the piece of junk -- and we see it for the first time: THE MILLENNIUM FALCON! TIE fighters BANK AROUND AGAIN. Finn, Rey and BB-8 run up the ramp of the semi-tarped Falcon. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY Finn, Rey and BB-8 enter the ship -- she hits a control and the door DESCENDS CLOSED as she races to the cockpit: REY Gunner position's down there! FINN (climbs down) Y'ever fly this thing? INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY Rey tosses her staff aside, jumps into the pilot's seat, frantically flips switches. BB-8 rolls in behind her as the ENGINES WHINE to life: REY No! This ship hasn't been flown in years! INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNNER POSITION - DAY Finn buckles into the gunner seat -- to his shock the SEAT WHIPS TO THE LEFT, startling him -- he grabs the controls to steady himself. FINN Great. (reacts to seat) Whoa! I can do this, I can do this-- INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY Rey bucks herself up. Doesn't believe her quick words: (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: REY I can do this, I can do this-- Rey pulls the yoke: THE FALCON ENGINES LIGHT UP BRIGHT! EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - SPACEPORT - DAY The FALCON RISES, WILDLY -- ITS TARPS FLY OFF -- THE SHIP SPINS AND TILTS, SLAMS INTO AND CRUMBLES THE TOWN'S ARCHWAY! From the tents, Unkar Plutt runs out, SCREAMS: UNKAR HEY!!!! THAT'S MIIIIIIINE!!! The Falcon BLASTS AWAY, two TIE FIGHTERS chase it, fast! INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY Rey pilots, headed for the sky! Finn SWINGS into frame, trying to work the GUNS. FINN Whoa! Hey! Oh! Stay low! Stay low! REY WHAT? FINN Stay low! It confuses their tracking! For a crazy instant Rey LETS GO OF THE YOKE, stretches to the co-pilot controls -- THE FALCON CANTS! REY BB-8, hold on! Rey finally REACHES the switches, returns to the yoke, stabilizing the ship, afraid of this next move. REY I'M GOING LOW!!! EXT. DESERT - DAY BEHIND THE FALCON as it DRAMATICALLY BANKS AT AN UPWARD ARC, UPSIDE-DOWN, then SWOOPS PERILOUSLY LOW across the sand. Two TIE FIGHTERS SCREAM past us! INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY In the cylindrical corridor, BB-8 ROLLS TO THE CEILING! Rey looks back for a flash as the TIE Fighters pass -- They are ROCKED BY A BLAST! (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: REY What are you doing back there? Are you ever gonna fire back?! Finn flicks switches -- The GUN TARGETING LIGHTS UP: FINN I'm working on it! Are the shields up? Rey strains, reaching for something in the co-pilot seat. REY Not so easy without a co-pilot! Finn struggles with the gun controls and SWEEPING CHAIR: FINN Try sitting in this thing! Finn finally FIRES BACK at the two TIE FIGHTERS! EXT. DESERT - DAY Finn's shots MISS. The TIE FIGHTERS ARC BACK IN PURSUIT and SCREAM PAST US toward the Falcon! Both TIES FIRING! INT. TIE FIGHTER COCKPIT - DAY The BLACK-SUITED PILOT FIRES at the Falcon. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNNER POSITION - DAY The Falcon is ROCKED by another BLAST! FINN We need cover, quick! INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY Rey HITS SWITCHES, pilots the best she can: REY We're about to get some! (to herself) I hope. EXT. DESERT - DAY The Falcon speeds through a ROCK FORMATION, GRAZING THE ROCK, TAKING OUT A CHUNK -- the two TIE Fighters in pursuit, FIRING! The Falcon BANKS SO HARD, the edge of the ship RIPS A LINE IN THE SAND as it turns, REVEALING THE SHIP GRAVEYARD AHEAD. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY BB-8 EXTENDS MAGNETIC CABLES to brace himself in a corridor. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: Finn continues to fire at the TIE fighters, narrowly missing them. FINN Damn it! Rey maneuvers the ship deeper into the graveyard. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNNER POSITION - DAY Finn SWOOPS into frame, FIRES -- FINN Come on... come on... -- HITS AND SHATTERS the TIE FIGHTER! REY Nice shot! FINN I'm getting pretty good at this! EXT. DESERT - SPACESHIP GRAVEYARD - DAY The TIE FIGHTER CRASHES amid the DEBRIS, THREE SCAVENGERS instantly there to consume the new bounty. The Falcon, pursued by the ONE REMAINING TIE FIGHTER, slaloms through the MASSIVE WRECKAGE, GRAZING THE OLD SHIPS as she goes, pieces flying. The TIE FIGHTER FIRES -- HITTING THE FALCON'S LOWER TURRET, SPINNING IT, JAMMING IT INTO FORWARD POSITION! INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNNER POSITION - DAY ALARMS BLARE -- FINN The cannon's stuck in forward position, I can't move it! You gotta lose 'em! INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY The ship is HIT AGAIN -- afraid, Rey's mind races as she scans the area -- and gets an idea. REY Get ready! FINN Okay! For what? EXT. DESERT - SPACESHIP GRAVEYARD - DAY Rey pilots the ship up AND INTO THE REAR OF A CRASHED SUPER STAR DESTROYER! The final TIE FIGHTER FOLLOWS! INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY Finn peers out the window, realizing where they are: FINN ARE WE REALLY DOING THIS?! INT. WRECKED SUPER STAR DESTROYER - DAY The two ships slalom debris inside the giant ship -- the Falcon GRAZING ONE SIDE, THEN THE OTHER, SPITTING SPARKS! INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY Rey, scared, girds herself as she quickly runs out of space in the wreck. REY Oh no! Just as the TIE PILOT GETS A LOCK, Rey YANKS THE YOKE -- EXT. DESERT - SPACESHIP GRAVEYARD - DAY The Falcon makes a HARD RIGHT TURN out of the Destroyer. Rey then CUTS POWER AND FLIPS THE SHIP SO BACK FACES FRONT! FINN CAN NOW SEE THE PURSUING TIE FIGHTER! He FIRES, DESTROYING IT! REY GUNS THE ENGINES again, FLIPS THE FALCON and FLIES AWAY as the TIE FIGHTER CRASHES! FINN Whooo! The Falcon ROARS OFF, victorious, leaving the ship graveyard and disappearing into the clouds. EXT. SPACE - DAY The Falcon ROARS from Jakku off to space. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY Rey excitedly unbuckles her seatbelt and hurries back. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CORRIDOR - DAY Rey races past BB-8, who is RETRACTING his safety restraints. Finn, adrenalized, climbs from the turret, meets Rey in the corridor, the LOUNGE in the b.g.. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: FINN Now that was some flying! How did you do that?! No one trained you? No one? That was amazing! (beat) You set me up for it! (cocky) That was pretty good. REY Good shooting! Thanks! I-- I don't know! -- I've flown some ships but I've never left the planet! Your last shot was dead on. You got him with one blast! (laughs) It was perfect! They're just staring at each other now, seeing something odd and weird and wonderful -- two people totally inexperienced in joy and camaraderie. Bb-8 BEEPS something urgent -- she turns to the droid, kneels. REY (CONT'D) You're ok. He's with the Resistance. He's going to get you home. We both will. (to Finn) I don't know your name. FINN Finn. What's yours. REY I'm Rey. BB-8 looks at him: really? Finn is reminded: HE'S LIED TO HER. She looks at Finn with a sweet smile. FINN Rey... But before Finn can say anything they JUMP: across the lounge, STEAM BURSTS from under the grating. REY Help me with this! Quick! They hurry to the grating, PULL IT UP together. BB-8 rolls over, watches. FINN Whoa! What's going on? She goes below as BB-8 BEEPS concern. EXT. SPACE - DAY The First Order Star Destroyer above Jakku. INT. STAR DESTROYER BRIDGE - DAY Lieutenant Mitaka moves to Ren, who looks out across the star field. Mitaka swallows, uneasy with his task. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: LIEUTENANT MITAKA Sir. We were unable to acquire the droid on Jakku. Ren turns to look at him, he says nothing. LIEUTENANT MITAKA (CONT'D) It escaped capture aboard a stolen Corellian YT model freighter. KYLO REN The droid... stole a freighter? LIEUTENANT MITAKA Not exactly, sir. It had help. Ren says nothing. Which says everything. Mitaka sweats. LIEUTENANT MITAKA (CONT'D) We have no confirmation, but we believe FN-2187 may have been helped in the escape-- Ren IGNITES HIS LIGHTSABER, TURNS AND SLASHES AT THE CONSOLE BEHIND HIM! HOLD ON Mitaka, who reacts, looks away -- winces. The horrible SOUNDS of Ren's rage continues. Finally Mitaka looks up. The metallic wall behind Ren is RIPPED with glowing scars. KYLO REN Anything else? Mitaka hates to say the following, but: LIEUTENANT MITAKA The two were accompanied by a girl. Ren reaches out -- Mitaka is suddenly, violently PULLED TOWARD REN, into his black glove: KYLO REN What girl? INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - LOUNGE AREA - DAY Rey's head POPS up from under the grating, surrounded by STEAM. An EMERGENCY ALARM BLARES. REY It's the motivator! Grab me a Harris wrench -- check in there! As he checks a storage box, she disappears down below, overwhelmed by the technical issues -- FINN How bad is it?! (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: REY If we wanna live, not good! BB-8 watches as Finn searches A SELECTION OF TOOLS: FINN They're hunting for us now, we gotta get outta this system! Rey re-emerges, Finn hands her the wrench. REY BB-8 said the location of the Resistance Base is ""need to know"" -- if I'm taking you there, I need to know! FINN (Throws a tool) This? She catches it and goes under again, leaving Finn and BB-8 alone. He contemplates telling her the truth. This is his moment. But instead he knees to BB-8, says quietly, urgently: FINN (CONT'D) You gotta tell us where the base is. (BB-8 BEEPS) I don't speak that. Alright, between us, I'm not with the Resistance, okay? (BB-8 backs up) -- I'm just trying to get away from the First Order -- but you tell us where your base is, I'll get there first -- deal?! (BB-8 COCKS his head) Droid, please. Rey pops up again: REY Pilex driver, hurry! Finn moves for the tool. REY (CONT'D) So where's your base? FINN (searching, to BB-8) Go on BB-8, tell her. (quietly) Please! She and Finn look to BB-8 -- who considers the whole situation, then BEEPS. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: REY The Ileenium system? Finn hands her the tool, surprised but thrilled -- Rey disappears below again. FINN Yeah, the Ileenium system, that's the one -- get us there as fast as you can. A smiling Finn gives BB-8 a THUMBS UP. BB-8 quickly extends his WELDING TORCH and TURNS IT UPWARD, then retracts it. REY I'll drop you two at Ponemah Terminal. I need the bonding tape, hurry! FINN (searching for tape) What about you? REY I gotta get back to Jakku! FINN (loses his mind) BACK TO JAK--?! Why does everyone always wanna go back to Jakku?! ! REY No, that one! No. No. The one I'm pointing to! No. NO. NO. If we don't patch it up, the propulsion tank will overflow and flood the ship with poisonous gas! Bb-8 has moved to Finn -- TIPS HIS HEAD, shows him the tool. He throws her the tape, she disappears below: FINN This? REY Yes! FINN Hey. Rey. You're a pilot -- you can fly anywhere! Why go back?! You got a family? You got a boyfriend? Cute boyfriend? The STEAM and ALARM STOP as Rey pops up, annoyed: REY None of your business, THAT'S WHY! But then: ALL THE SHIP POWER GOES OUT. BB-8 is nervous. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: FINN ... That can't be good. REY (heads off) -- No it can't be -- FINN FOLLOWS REY TO: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY They plop into the seats, in a panic. She checks the dead instrumentation panel: REY Someone's locked onto us -- all controls are overridden. Finn quickly, awkwardly climbs up, looks out. REY (CONT'D) Get off. Get off! See anything? FINN ... Oh no. EXT. SPACE - DAY The Millennium Falcon, powerless, is a sitting duck. SOMETHING EPIC appears from ABOVE: THE ANTENNA ARRAY IS THE FIRST WE SEE OF A MASSIVE FREIGHTER, ITS GIANT HANGAR OPEN LIKE A HUGE MOUTH WHICH SWALLOWS THE FALCON LIKE A WHALE! INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY Finn PLOPS into his seat, horrified. FINN It's the First Order. REY What do we do-- there must be something -- Finn's mind races -- then: FINN You said poisonous gas -- REY -- Yeah, but I fixed that -- FINN Can you unfix it? Rey stares at him -- and gets his plan! They head off -- INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - LOUNGE AREA - DAY The GAS MASKS hanging in the lounge are GRABBED. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: Finn and Rey, gas masks on, quickly climb into the open grating area. REY C'mon BB-8. They help BB-8 down, too: they both struggle like crazy, he weighs a TON. FINN I got it. REY Oooh... FINN I'm okay. BB-8 get off me... UNDER THE GRATING Finn pulls the grating over them as Rey works on the controls. REY You think this'll work on the Stormtroopers? FINN Yeah. Their masks filter out smoke, not toxins. LIGHTS COME ON! SOUND of the SHIP RAMP LOWERING! Finn PULLS THE GRATING CLOSED as he says: FINN (CONT'D) Hurry! REY I'm hurrying! Suddenly the FALCON DOOR OPENS -- AND HAN SOLO AND CHEWBACCA BOARD THE FALCON, weapons at the ready. PUSH IN ON THEM, ready for combat, operating silently, with hand signals only. HAN Chewie, we're home. Han gives Chewie a nod to check out the ship. Chewie heads off one way, Han in another. The grating above LIFTS OFF -- hands in surrender, they look up at Han, who's training his blaster on them, threatening. They're SCARED. HAN (CONT'D) Where are the others? Where's the pilot? REY ...I'm the pilot... (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: HAN You? Chewie MOAN-TALKS. Rey responds to him -- REY No, it's true: we're the only ones on board. FINN You can understand that thing? HAN And ""that thing"" can understand you too, so watch it. Come on outta there. They climb up -- BB-8 uses his magnetic arm to quickly pull himself out. HAN (CONT'D) Where'd you get this ship? REY Niima Outpost. HAN Jakku?! That junkyard? FINN Thank you! Junkyard! HAN (to Chewie) Told ya we should've double-checked the Western Reaches! (to Rey) Who had it, Ducain? REY I stole it from Unkar Plutt. He stole it from the Irving Boys, who stole it from Ducain. HAN Who stole it from me! Well, you tell him Han Solo just stole back the Millennium Falcon for good. Han walks away, takes in the ship: it's his again. Doesn't see that Rey is awed. His back to all of them, he smiles. Chewie responds as Han heads toward the cockpit. REY This is the Millennium Falcon? You're Han Solo? (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: HAN I used to be. FINN Han Solo? The Rebellion General? REY No, the smuggler! FINN (to Chewie) Wasn't he a war hero?! Chewie replies: ""Yeah, I guess, kinda..."" Rey calls out: REY This is the ship that made the Kessel Run in fourteen parsecs...! INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - SAME Han enters the cockpit. HAN Twelve! Fourteen. A moment of private joy. Then he sees something that ANNOYS him: HAN (CONT'D) Hey! Some moof-milker put a compressor on the ignition line! Han moves to the corridor. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - LOUNGE AREA - DAY REY Unkar Plutt did. I thought it was a mistake too, puts too much stress on the hyperdrive-- HAN (overlapping her) -- Stress on the hyperdrive-- (who is she? Then:) Chewie, throw 'em in a pod, we'll drop them at the nearest inhabited planet. REY Wait! No -- we need your help! HAN My help? REY This droid has to get to the Resistance base as soon as possible! (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: FINN He's carrying a map to Luke Skywalker. Yup: Han stops in his tracks. FINN (CONT'D) You are the Han Solo that fought with the Rebellion. You knew him. The mention of Luke has really hit Han. He turns to Finn. HAN Yeah, I knew him. I knew Luke. Suddenly: a distant, METALLIC KA-CHUNK! HAN (CONT'D) Don't tell me a Rathtar's gotten loose-- Han hurries out -- they all follow, (Chewie, Rey, Finn, then BB-8), Finn with WILD CONCERN: FINN Wait -- a what?! Did you just say Rathtars? Hey! INT. CARGO SHIP - HANGAR - DAY The Falcon is parked in this giant freighter's hangar. Han moves to a CONTROL PANEL, they all follow him. FINN You're not hauling Rathtars on this freighter, are you? HAN I'm hauling Rathtars. On the CONTROL PANEL: IMAGES ON SCREENS FROM ALL AROUND THE SHIP. Including the EXTERIOR, where a TRANSPORT SHIP is LANDING ON THE FREIGHTER. Han is fearful. HAN (CONT'D) Oh great. It's the Guavian Death Gang -- they must've tracked us from Nantoon. Han heads off as: REY What's a Rathtar? INT. CARGO SHIP - CARGO CONTAINER CORRIDOR - DAY Han leads our group down a LONG NARROW HALL lined with cargo containers. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: HAN They're big and dangerous... FINN Y'ever heard of the Trillia Massacre?! REY No. FINN Good. They turn a corner: HAN I got three of 'em going to King Prana. FINN THREE?! How'd you get them on board? HAN I used to have a bigger crew. Chewie GROAN-TALKS, concurring. CUT TO: LOOKING UP AS A HATCH OPENS IN THE FLOOR. HAN AND CO. ARE THERE. HAN Get below deck and stay there until I say so -- don't even think about taking the Falcon. REY What about BB-8? HAN He stays with me -- until I get rid of the gang, then you can have him back and be on your way. FINN What about the Rathtars... where are you keeping them? A TERRIFYING BAM: a GROTESQUE RATHTAR GIANT TONGUE SLAMS into the CARGO CONTAINER window behind Finn, whose heart stops. HAN There's one. REY What are you gonna do? HAN Same thing I always do: talk my way out of it. (Chewie MOAN-TALKS) Yes, I do. Every time. INT. CARGO SHIP - NARROW CORRIDOR - DAY A PORTAL opens. The GUAVIAN DEATH GANG enters. One man in a SUIT (BALA-TIK), and five SECURITY SOLDIERS in badass UNIFORMS with ROUND-FACE HELMETS. They turn into and stop at one end of the corridor. Han, Chewie and BB-8 forty feet away in the middle of the long hall. BALA-TIK Han Solo. You are a dead man. Han smiles innocently, friendly. BB-8 nervously looks back and forth at the gang, and Han. HAN Bala-Tik. What's the problem? BALA-TIK The problem is we loaned you fifty thousand for this job. INTERCUT WITH: INT. CARGO SHIP - BELOW FLOOR GRATING - DAY They look up, trying to get a view. REY Can you see them? FINN No. They start crawling down the crawl space. BALA-TIK I heard you also borrowed fifty thousand from Kanjiklub. HAN You know you can't trust those little freaks! How long've we known each other? Rey and Finn arrive under the gang. They WHISPER: REY They have blasters... FINN A lot of 'em. We RISE THROUGH THE FLOOR to see the GANG and Han and company in the distance. BALA-TIK The question is how much longer will we know each other? Not long. We want our money back now. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: HAN Ya think hunting Rathtars is cheap? I spent that money. BALA-TIK Kanjiklub wants their investment back, too. HAN I never made a deal with Kanjiklub! BALA-TIK Tell that to Kanjiklub. The SOUND of a PORTAL OPENING. Han's face GOES WHITE as he turns to the OTHER END OF THE CORRIDOR, where KANJIKLUB MEMBERS APPEAR. A GANG in a MEDIEVAL BANDITO style. Han smiles uncomfortably at the Kanjiklub members. Its LEADER, TASU LEECH, out front. Han tries to play it off: HAN Tasu Leech. Good to see you. Tasu speaks an alien language, we SUBTITLE: TASU LEECH Wrong again, Solo. It's over for you. Tasu COCKS HIS WEAPON, there for blood. BB-8 is nervous. Finn and Rey react to the sounds of the new gang -- start CRAWLING BACK the other way to see them. HAN Boys. You're both gonna get what I promised! Have I ever not delivered for you before? BALA-TIK Yeah. TASU LEECH Twice! Han realizes he's right. HAN What was the second time? BALA-TIK Your game is old. There's no one in the galaxy left for you to swindle. TASU LEECH Nowhere left for you to hide. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: BALA-TIK That BB unit... the First Order is looking for one just like it. And two fugitives. Finn and Rey SUDDENLY STOP CRAWLING, tense. BB-8 hides behind Han's leg. PUSH IN ON Han as he realizes: Finn and Rey are in real trouble. HAN First I've heard of it. Below the grating, Finn and Rey look at each other, afraid. Above, another Kanjiklubber (RAZOO QIN-FEE) says (SUBTITLED): RAZOO QIN-FEE Search the freighter. One of the Kanjiklubbers begins moving down the corridor, AIMING A FLASHLIGHT DOWN BELOW, searching for: FINN AND REY, in a QUIET PANIC BELOW: THEY START CRAWLING FAST in the opposite direction they came. Rey crawls off fast, Finn follows. They quickly arrive at a JUNCTION BOX AREA, Rey looking at the controls. REY Wait wait wait wait. If we close the blast doors in that corridor, we can trap both gangs! FINN Close the blast doors from here? REY Resetting the fuses should do it. Rey begins RESETTING the FUSES, SPARKS shooting from them as they do. Finn quickly joins in. Rey and Finn FINISH resetting the fuses boxes. Rey smiles optimistically. Finn looks hopeful too. DOWN AN EMPTY ROW OF LARGE CONTAINERS, which OPEN -- and a GIANT RATHTAR -- an ENORMOUS, FIERCE AND RAVENOUS LAND OCTOPUS -- SLITHERS OUT OF ITS CAGE! BACK UP TOP as BANKS OF LIGHTS BEGIN GOING OFF, ONE BY ONE. The GANGS look around. Han's eyes go wide -- he gets it -- and it's bad. QUIETLY: HAN ... I got a bad feeling about this... Suddenly all the LIGHTS COME ON AGAIN -- even down below, where Rey realizes it hasn't gone as planned. REY Oh no. FINN Oh no, what? REY (pale) Wrong fuses. IN ANOTHER CORRIDOR, BACK WITH THE GANGS: BALA-TIK Kill them! And take the droid! The gangs AIM THEIR WEAPONS JUST AS A RATHTAR APPEARS BEHIND THE GUAVIAN DEATH GANG, GRABBING TWO MEMBERS! THE OTHERS SCREAM AND RUN! The gang FIRES BACK -- BLASTS FLY! Han and Chewie react, flinching -- then turn to Kanjiklub as a RATHTAR APPEARS BEHIND THEM, ROARING DEAFENINGLY! The Gang turns -- others run, FIRE AT IT. INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR A - DAY Han, Chewie and BB-8 race down the hall -- A MEMBER OF THE KANJIKLUB GANG comes around the corner. Han PUNCHES him with one blow, throws him toward the Rathtar. They keep steppin.... INT. CARGO SHIP - BELOW FLOOR GRATING - DAY Rey and Finn hurriedly crawl through the space below decks. FINN This was a mistake! REY Huge! INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR A - DAY Two Guavian Death Gang members run through the ship -- passing Tasu Leech, who sees another Kanjiklub member down the corridor -- who gets GRABBED BY A TENTACLE! Tasu tries to help him, but he gets PULLED UP AND AWAY! Tasu hears a distant terror-scream of a Rathtar, and runs the other way. Other Kanjiklub members YELL at him to avoid that direction -- they all turn a corner -- a RATHTAR IS THERE AND GRABS THE TWO OTHERS! Tasu FIRES at the beast and RUNS OFF -- and we land on a FLOOR HATCH, which opens. Rey and Finn climb out, quickly. They turn a corridor -- REY What do they look like? (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: Another corner -- and GANG MEMBERS ARE BATTLING A HORRIBLE RATHTAR! Rey COVERS HER MOUTH. FINN They look like that. Finn yanks her away. They race around another corner -- a RATHTAR IS THERE! FINN (CONT'D) This way! REY Are you sure? They scream and run off -- but Finn is GRABBED, PULLED AWAY FAST! REY (CONT'D) FINN! But the Rathtar's fast and TURNS A CORNER, losing Rey -- FINN REY! INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR E - DAY TIGHT ON FINN as he's being yanked down the hall, SCREAMING as he struggles to get loose! Rey turns the corner -- Finn is gone -- nowhere to be seen. REY FINN!!!! Without Finn, she is instantly distraught -- then she realizes: SHE'S JUST PASSED A CONTROL PANEL! Her eyes light up as she moves to it: a BANK OF VIDEO MONITORS OF THE SHIP -- and there's Finn, being dragged by a Rathtar toward an OPEN BLAST DOOR. Rey's hand on the button, she waits... then SLAMS THE BUTTON! INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR B - DAY The BLAST DOOR INSTANTLY CLOSES ON ONE OF THE RATHTAR'S TENTACLES! It SCREAMS IN PAIN, ITS SEVERED TENTACLE STILL WRAPPED AROUND FINN'S LEG! Finn scrambles up, desperately shaking the sticky tentacle off his leg! Rey arrives, runs to Finn, beaming to see him alive -- he is adrenaline-rushed, in shock: REY Finn! FINN It had me! But the door--! (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: REY That was lucky! ANOTHER CORRIDOR - Finn and Rey run towards the Falcon. INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR D - DAY Han, Chewie and BB-8 take cover, Han exchanging BLASTER FIRE with GANG MEMBERS AT THE OTHER END OF THE HALL. HAN I got the door. Cover us! Chewie GROAN-AGREES. Chewie FIRES DOWN THE HALL as Han CROSSES THE CORRIDOR, BB-8 following nervously. As Chewie exchanges blaster fire, Han works the controls. THE HATCH OPENS (FALCON in the distance) -- just as CHEWIE IS HIT IN THE SHOULDER BY ENEMY FIRE! He goes down with a LOUD GROAN! HAN (CONT'D) Chewie! You okay? Han GRABS CHEWIE'S BOWCASTER, FIRES at the DOOR CONTROLS, BADASS! HAN (CONT'D) (looks at bowcaster) Wow. Come on! Come on! INT. CARGO SHIP HANGAR - DAY Run with Finn and Rey as they turn into the hangar, toward the Falcon. Han helps WOUNDED CHEWIE up the ramp, sees them. REY Han! Finn and Rey race past BB-8 -- as they go up the ramp, Han says to Rey: HAN You, close the door behind us! (to Finn) You take care of Chewie! Han and Rey race up the ramp as Finn heads up with Chewie, who SCREAMS WILDLY IN PAIN! INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY Han stands at the navicomputer, hitting switches. Rey enters fast, moves past him to Chewie's seat. HAN Hey, where are you going? (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: REY Unkar Plutt installed a fuel pump too -- if we don't prime that we're not going anywhere. HAN I hate that guy. Han sits as, Rey hitting buttons: REY And you could use a co-pilot. HAN I got one, he's back there. IN THE LOUNGE, CHEWIE IS IN PAIN -- INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY Han and Rey in the seats: HAN Watch the thrust, we're goin' out of here at lightspeed -- REY (shocked) From inside the hangar? Is that even possible? HAN I never ask that question until after I've done it. A RATHTAR JUMPS ONTO THE WINDSHIELD -- REY SCREAMS! Its GIANT MOUTH CHEWING AT THE GLASS! Han works the controls: HAN (CONT'D) This is not how I thought this day was gonna go -- angle the shields -- Hang on back there! IN THE LOUNGE, Chewie is in pain -- Finn going through a first aid kit -- the ship is HIT again -- FINN (huge problem) No problem! INT. CARGO SHIP - HANGAR - DAY Three GANG MEMBERS race out here and FIRE AT THE FALCON -- hitting FUEL LINES, BLASTING THE SHIP HARD! The ship is hit. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY HAN Come on baby, don't let me down! He hits a switch -- but NOTHING. HAN (CONT'D) What?! But Rey reaches over, hits a switch, matter-of-factly. REY Compressor. Han doesn't like it but she's right -- he hits the switch again and the HYPERDRIVE FIRES! The hangar is FILLED WITH LIGHTSPEED BLAST as the ATTACKING GANG MEMBERS ARE BLASTED BACK LIKE DRY LEAVES. In the cockpit the RATHTAR RIPS AWAY as THE STARS STRETCH LIKE ELASTIC and we CUT TO: EXT. CARGO SHIP - DAY Camera ROTATES as the Falcon DISAPPEARS IN A STREAK, leaving the cargo ship behind. INT. CARGO SHIP - DAY PUSH IN on a HANGAR DOOR where Bala-Tik arrives at the window, SEETHING. Makes a CALL: BALA-TIK Inform the First Order that Han Solo has the droid they want. And it's aboard the Millennium Falcon. EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY A pair of TIE fighters roar towards a magnificent PLANET, frozen WHITE. This is the STARKILLER BASE, a natural planet that has been hacked and modified into something sinister. Over this we HEAR a DEEP, almost SOOTHING VOICE. A voice very much in control, of power: SNOKE (V.O.) The droid will soon be delivered to the Resistance... INT. STARKILLER PLANET - ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT KYLO REN and General Hux in a dark space, looking UPWARD at someone addressing them. We're in a massive and dark ASSEMBLY ROOM. Hundreds of DESKS in a stadium arc, focused on a platform where we see SUPREME LEADER SNOKE. Not entirely human, at nearly twenty-five feet tall. All of him a STONY GREY. Old, wounded, fragile and powerful, all at the same time. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: SNOKE ... Leading them to the last Jedi. If Skywalker returns, the new Jedi will rise. GENERAL HUX Supreme Leader, I take full responsibility for th-- SNOKE General! Our strategy must now change. GENERAL HUX The weapon. It is ready. I believe the time has come to use it. We shall destroy the government that supports the Resistance, the Republic. Without their friends to protect them, the Resistance will be vulnerable, and we will stop them before they reach Skywalker. Snoke considers. Almost seems to die for a moment. Then: SNOKE Go. Oversee preparations. GENERAL HUX Yes, Supreme Leader. General Hux, proud, cocksure, exits. Kylo Ren watches him go. Snoke SITS. A new intimacy in his voice. SNOKE There's been an awakening. Have you felt it? KYLO REN Yes. SNOKE There's something more. The droid we seek is aboard the Millennium Falcon. In the hands of your father, Han Solo. Kylo Ren reacts with subtle, but real, surprise. KYLO REN He means nothing to me. SNOKE Even you, master of the Knights of Ren, have never faced such a test. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: KYLO REN (steely resolve) By the grace of your training, I will not be seduced. SNOKE We shall see. We shall see. A gentle, satisfied nod from Snoke, and Kylo Ren, obsessed, filled up, exits. Snoke watches him disappear, a grotesque evil SMILE growing -- as he DISINTEGRATES -- Snoke has been a HOLOGRAM all along. EXT. LIGHTSPEED SPACE - DAY RACING with the Falcon through the STRINGLIGHT of lightspeed. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY CHAOS: INTERCUT between the COCKPIT where Han and Rey pilot, ALARMS SOUNDING, problems everywhere, and the LOUNGE where CHEWIE YELPS as Finn nervously works to BANDAGE HIS SHOULDER. SPARKS! HAN Electrical overload! REY I can fix that! HAN The coolant's leaking! REY Try transferring auxiliary power to the secondary tank-- HAN -- Secondary tank, I got it! INT. LOUNGE: CHEWIE HOWLS IN PAIN! Finn hangs in there, wraps a bandage on Chewie's shoulder: Chewie ROARS. BB-8 scurries off. FINN Chewie, come on! I need help with this giant hairy thing! Stop moving! Chewie! INT. FALCON COCKPIT: HAN You hurt Chewie, you're gonna deal with me! INT. LOUNGE: As Finn struggles to bandage the Wookiee: FINN Hurt him?! He almost killed me six times! (Chewie GRABS HIM by the collar, ROARS) Which is fine. INT. FALCON COCKPIT: HAN This hyperdrive blows there's gonna be pieces of us in three different systems. Han at the controls when all the alarms STOP. Rey, satisfied, sits in the co-pilot seat. Han is confused. HAN (CONT'D) What'd you do? REY I by-passed the compressor. He looks at her. A little, appreciative laugh. Han exits, walking past BB-8. HAN Move, Ball. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - LOUNGE AREA - DAY Han kneels at Chewie, who lies awake but recovering. Han checks his friend's wound with care. Chewie MOAN-TALKS. HAN Nah, don't say that, you did great. Just rest. Han turns to Finn, who sits at the HOLOCHESS set, BB-8 beside him. This is awkward for Han, but damn, he means it: HAN (CONT'D) Good job, kid. And thanks. FINN You're welcome. Finn has accidentally hit a button on the chess set, and the PIECES appear, looking up at Finn, curiously. The pieces start to FIGHT as Finn fiddles with the controls, trying to turn it off. HAN So, fugitives, huh? REY The First Order wants the map. (MORE) (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: REY (CONT'D) (re: Finn and BB-8) Finn is with the Resistance... (shrugs) ... I'm just a scavenger. Han gives Finn a skeptical once-over as Finn finally manages to TURN THE CHESS SET OFF as Rey enters. Han looks to BB-8. HAN Let's see whatcha got. REY (To BB-8) Go ahead. BB-8 rolls forward -- and suddenly PROJECTS A HOLOGRAPHIC MAP, FILLING THE ROOM. PLANETS, STARS, SYSTEMS. They all react. Chewie sits to look up. Han moves through stars, becomes reflective. HAN This map's not complete. It's just a piece. Ever since Luke disappeared, people have been looking for him. REY Why'd he leave? HAN He was training a new generation of Jedi. One boy, an apprentice turned against him, destroyed it all. Luke felt responsible... He walked away from everything. FINN Do you know what happened to him? HAN There're a lot of rumors. Stories. The people who knew him the best think he went looking for the first Jedi temple. REY The Jedi were real? HAN I used to wonder that myself. Thought it was a bunch of mumbo-jumbo -- magical power holding together good, evil, the dark side and the light. (beat) 'Crazy thing is, it's true. The Force, the Jedi, all of it. It's all true. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: An alarm rings on the control station, prompting Han to toggle some switches. BB-8 cuts off the hologram. Chewie rises and moans to Han, but Han motions for Chewie to lay back down: HAN (CONT'D) No, you rest. (To Rey and Finn) You want my help? You're getting it. Gonna see an old friend. She'll get your droid home. This is our stop. Han leaves towards the cockpit, Rey and Finn following. EXT. LIGHTSPEED TO SPACE - DAY BEHIND THE FALCON as it DROPS OUT OF LIGHTSPEED, revealing a BEAUTIFUL GREEN PLANET ahead, TAKODANA. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY Han pilots. Finn and BB-8 beside him, Rey as co-pilot. Han notices Rey looking out the windshield, almost in tears. REY (quietly) ... I didn't know there was this much green in the whole galaxy... Han watches her -- sees a vulnerability that touches him. EXT. TAKODANA PLANET - DAY The Falcon CRESTS OVER an ENDLESS GREEN FOREST TO REVEAL a CASTLE on a picturesque LAKE. The Falcon lands near the castle, among dozens of WORN, smallish freighters. EXT. LANDING PAD - NEAR MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY Rey steps off the Falcon, UP TO CAMERA, BB-8 at her side. She takes in the towering stone CASTLE, FOREST to one side, LAKE to the other. Serene, beautiful, all new to her. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - LOUNGE AREA - DAY From BLACKNESS: a storage unit opens. Han rummages, retrieving old BLASTERS. Finn arrives behind him, concerned. FINN Hey, Solo -- I'm not sure what we're walking into here -- HAN D'you just call me ""Solo""? (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: FINN Sorry. Han-- Mr. Solo. You should know, I'm a big deal in the Resistance. Which puts a real target on my back. Are there any conspirators here? First Order sympathizers? HAN Listen big deal, you've got another problem. Women always figure out the truth. Hands him a BLASTER. HAN (CONT'D) Always. Han walks off. Finn watches him go, wracked with guilt. EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY Han hands Rey a blaster pistol as she stands at looks at the castle. HAN You might need this. REY I think I can handle myself. HAN I know you do. That's why I'm giving it to you. Take it. Rey picks it up. Grips it. HAN (CONT'D) You know how to use one of these? REY Yeah, you pull the trigger. HAN There's a little bit more to it than that. You got a lot to learn. You got a name? REY Rey. HAN Rey. I've been thinkin' about bringing on some more crew, Rey. A second mate. Someone to help out. Someone who can keep up with Chewie and me, appreciates the Falcon. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: REY Are you offering me a job? HAN I wouldn't be nice to you. It doesn't pay much. REY You're offering me a job. HAN I'm thinking about it. Rey wants to say yes. But something stops her. A line she can't cross. HAN (CONT'D) Well? REY If you were, I'd be flattered. But I have to get home. Han looks at her, questioningly. HAN Jakku? Rey looks off, in thought. Yeah, Jakku. REY (beat) I've already been away too long. HAN (to Chewie) Chewie, check out the ship as best you can. HAN (CONT'D) It's too bad. Chewie kind of likes you. Han heads off. HOLD on Rey. EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY Han walks them to the castle. FINN Solo, why are we here again? HAN To get your droid on a clean ship. REY Clean? (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: HAN Do you think it was luck that Chewie and I found the Falcon? If we can find it on our scanners, the First Order's not far behind. Want to get BB-8 to the Resistance? Maz Kanata is our best bet. FINN We can trust her, right? HAN Relax, kid. She's run this watering hole for a thousand years. Maz is a bit of an acquired taste, so let me do the talking. And whatever you do, don't stare... REY AND FINN At what? HAN Any of it. The door opens. Music. Madness. And... INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - MAIN ROOM - DAY We ENTER THE LOUD, CROWDED MESS of a hall -- PUSHING PAST a room full of rough and odd ALIENS AND HUMANS, who gamble, drink, scheme, negotiate, argue -- until we end up on the BACK of a tiny, thousand year-old, four foot tall ALIEN, who suddenly STARTS, as if SENSING something -- the Alien TURNS TO US: she is FEMALE, wearing large ADJUSTABLE GOGGLES. This is MAZ KANATA. MAZ Han Solo! Everyone turns to look. It's ALL QUIET in here. HAN (Sotto) Oh boy. (Louder, waving) Hey, Maz! NOISE returns. Maz walks to them, pushes someone away. MAZ Where's my boyfriend? HAN Chewie's working on the Falcon. MAZ I like that Wookiee. I assume you need something. Desperately. Let's get to it. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: Maz walks off, gesturing for them to follow. Finn and Rey are confused. Han indicates for them to follow. They do -- passing the enormous GRUMMGAR, who sits with vixen BAZINE NETAL, who watches them suspiciously. A SMALL DROID (GA-97), who turns its head to see BB-8 following Rey across the room. GA-97, now animated, makes a small TRANSMITTING SOUND, which is subtitled. GA-97 Alert the Resistance. Their missing droid is here! And we CUT TO: IN A DARK ALCOVE - MOMENTS LATER Bazine enters a shadowy space, stealthily makes a call on a communicator. Clearly, BAZINE IS A SPY. Subtitled: BAZINE Inform the First Order... I've found the droid. EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY A massive Star Destroyer hovers over the hacked ice planet. INT. STAR DESTROYER - KYLO REN'S CHAMBERS - DAY A dark space. Kylo Ren, CLOSE TO CAMERA, addresses someone OFF-CAMERA whom we do not see. KYLO REN Forgive me. I feel it again. The pull to the light. Supreme Leader senses it. Show me again, the power of the darkness, and I will let nothing stand in our way. Show me, Grandfather, and I will finish what you started. As his emotion builds, he stands and heads off -- we FOLLOW HIM, PIVOTING TO REVEAL who he was talking to: THE BURNT, ASHEN, GHOSTLY DEFORMED MASK OF DARTH VADER. CUT TO: INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - TABLE - DAY Maz is putting together some FOOD as she says: MAZ A map to Skywalker himself? You're right back in the mess. HAN Maz, I need you to get this droid to Leia. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: MAZ Hmm. No. You've been running away from this fight for too long. Han, nyakee nago wadda. Go home! HAN Leia doesn't want to see me. FINN Please, we came here for your help. REY What fight? MAZ The only fight: against the dark side. Through the ages, I've seen evil take many forms. The Sith. The Empire. Today, it is the First Order. Their shadow is spreading across the galaxy. We must face them. Fight them. All of us. FINN There is no fight against the First Order! Not one we can win. Look around. There's no chance we haven't been recognized already. I bet you the First Order is on their way right-- Finn stops, seeing Maz adjusting her goggles, scrutinizing him -- her eyes get HUGE. FINN (CONT'D) What's this? What are you doing? Maz adjusts the goggles again. Her eyes get impossibly BIGGER. She grunts recognition. She hoists herself on the tabletop, knocking over food and plates, crawling towards Finn. FINN (CONT'D) Solo, what is she doing? HAN I don't know, but it ain't good. MAZ If you live long enough you see the same eyes in different people. I'm looking at the eyes of a man who wants to run. FINN (eyes on Maz) You don't know a thing about me. Where I'm from. What I've seen. (MORE) (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: FINN (CONT'D) You don't know the First Order like I do. They'll slaughter us. We all need to run. Rey is stunned. Maz, not so much. She crawls back to her chair. She points to some pirates in the corner. MAZ You see those two? They'll trade work for transportation to the Outer Rim. There, you can disappear. Finn sees them. Considers. REY Finn! FINN Come with me. REY What about BB-8? We're not done yet. We have to get him back to your base. FINN I can't. Finn stands to leave. He offers the gun back to Han. HAN Keep it, kid. Finn heads off. Rey gets up to follow. Maz dials her lenses back to normal, and turns to Han. MAZ Who's the girl? ON FINN Who has arrived at the table with the ALIEN SMUGGLERS. FINN I was told you could get me to the Outer Rim. Rey barges into the conversation, interrupting. REY What are you doing? Finn gets up to talk to her. FINN (to Big Head) Don't leave without me. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: Embarrassed, Finn moves her away. REY You can't just go. I won't let you. FINN I'm not who you think I am. REY Finn, what are you talking about? FINN I'm not Resistance. I'm not a hero. I'm a Stormtrooper. (stops her) Like all of them, I was taken from a family I'll never know. And raised to do one thing... (emotional) But my first battle, I made a choice. I wasn't going to kill for them. So I ran. FINN (CONT'D) Right into you. And you looked at me like no one ever had. I was ashamed of what I was. But I'm done with the First Order. I'm never going back. Rey, come with me. REY Don't go. FINN Take care of yourself. Please. Rey looks at him, crushed. With quiet resignation, Rey watches Finn return to the aliens... And all three head off. He gets to the front door and walks through it. Rey is heartsick, but she turns as she hears the sound of a young girl in anguish, crying. She follows the sound into the castle, turning so she can't see that Finn has looked back at her one last time. INT. MAZ' CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY Rey steps down into the basement corridor. BB-8 follows her. Walking carefully and confused, she is not sure why she's down here. She can hear the echoing sounds of a young girl crying. She heads down the hall... to the very end, where there is a door. It is almost as if a SOULFUL VIBRATION draws her closer. She looks at the door lock -- AND THE DOOR OPENS. Hesitant, Rey enters. INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - CRYPT ROOM - DAY Rey moves into the dark, small, vaulted storage room. Old treasures line the floors and walls, but there is something specific Rey is drawn to: on a table, an old wooden BOX. She moves to it, unsure, afraid, as if an energy from inside the box has been calling her here. BB-8 nervously follows. Rey reaches out, very slowly, to touch the box. A moment heavy with tension. Rey OPENS THE BOX and sees inside Luke Skywalker's original lightsaber. With hesitation, she reaches towards it, but she cannot resist. As her hand makes contact with it, there is the piercing sound of a lightsaber igniting. She moves her hand away, as REY HEARS A MECHANICAL BREATHING sound. The CAMERA MOVES, LIGHTING CHANGES -- and we see behind her something impossible: a HALLWAY OF FROM DEEP INSIDE CLOUD CITY. Disembodied voices fill the air. YOUNG GIRL NO! She stands -- looks around, confused by all she sees and hears. -- Turns and sees, through a DOORWAY. We follow Rey and she runs down the corridor, but it all TILTS -- TURNS -- and she lands on the WALL -- which is now the GROUND -- dried GRASS. She turns to look -- we PIVOT -- and see a BURNING TEMPLE AT NIGHT. We PAN to: R2-D2 -- who watches the flames -- and a MAN appears (LUKE, whose face we do not see). He falls to his knees, reaches out to the droid -- with a MECHANICAL RIGHT HAND. We PUSH IN ON REY as RAIN BEGINS -- and DAY TURNS TO NIGHT -- and she LOOKS UP -- we TILT UP -- To see we're LOOKING UP AT A WARRIOR as he is STABBED BY A FIERY LIGHTSABER! He screams and falls to the ground -- we FOLLOW HIM, revealing Rey again, now in a nighttime battlefield. She gets to her feet, frightened by what she sees. We PIVOT AROUND HER to REVEAL KYLO REN, and the six other KNIGHTS OF REN, who flank him! Come back around to Rey, soaking now, as the RAIN STOPS and SUNLIGHT illuminates her -- she turns to look -- we PIVOT -- and see... A little girl. Rey as a child. She is sobbing, hysterical. Unkar Plutt's meaty hand holds her thin arm. She is on Jakku, watching a starship fly into the sky, abandoning her. YOUNG GIRL No, come back! (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: UNKAR PLUTT Quiet, girl! The ship flies towards the desert sun, which is strangely eclipsed, as if being eaten by darkness. Rey looks around her to see she is.. In a NIGHTTIME, BARREN, SNOWY WOODS. She's losing her mind, confounded and lost and she gets to her feet, her breath seen in the frigid air -- and then: THE SOUND OF CLASHING LIGHTSABERS! She moves through the woods, toward the sound. Rey runs, heart pounding, when KYLO REN EMERGES FROM BEHIND A TREE! She stops, SCREAMS, FALLS BACK and LANDS IN: INT. MAZ' CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY She falls back, out of the room, suddenly sitting in the hall, out of breath, alarmed and perplexed. She HEARS something and turns to look. Maz stands at the end of the corridor, realizing what has just happened. REY What was that? I shouldn't have gone in there. MAZ That lightsaber was Luke's. And his father's before him and now, it calls to you! Rey stands, fast. Still overwhelmed, emotional, speechless. REY I have to get back to Jakku. MAZ Han told me. (reaches out, hold Rey's hand) Dear child. I see your eyes. You already know the truth. Whomever you're waiting for on Jakku, they're never coming back. But... there's someone who still could. REY Luke. MAZ The belonging you seek is not behind you. It is ahead. I am no Jedi, but I know the Force. It moves through and surrounds every living thing. Close your eyes. Feel it. (MORE) (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: MAZ (CONT'D) The light. It's always been there. It will guide you. The saber. Take it. Rey suddenly stands. REY I'm never touching that again. I don't want any part of this. And Rey runs off, passing Maz. Rey's mind is spinning -- she can't take it -- she turns and heads off, fast. BB-8 follows her. TIGHT ON MAZ, watching her go. Maz SIGHS, feeling for the young girl. EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY Rey exits the castle, needs to run, but doesn't know where. Heads toward the woods. EXT. FOREST - DAY Rey moves through the foliage, heart racing. Over this, we HEAR a RUMBLING -- intense, an OMEN of something horrible to come. EXT. STARKILLER BASE - ASSEMBLY AREA - DAY A massive rally: a thousand STORMTROOPERS, TIE FIGHTERS, OFFICERS and VEHICLES. BRUTALIST STRUCTURES, mountainous SNOWY LANDSCAPE. Addressing them at a podium, flanked by RED FIRST ORDER BANNERS, is HUX. His voice ECHOES: GENERAL HUX Today is the end of the Republic! The end of a regime that acquiesces to disorder! At this very moment, in a system far from here the New Republic LIES to the GALAXY while secretly supporting the treachery of the loathsome Resistance. This fierce machine which you have built, upon which we stand, will bring an end to the Senate! To their cherished fleet! All remaining systems will bow to the First Order! And will remember this... as the last day of the Republic! INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - DAY ENGINEERS perform FINAL FIRING PROTOCOL. There's a sense of nervousness -- WILL THIS MASSIVE WEAPON ACTUALLY WORK? EXT. STARKILLER BASE - ASSEMBLY AREA - DAY GENERAL HUX FIRE! And Hux TURNS to give the signal as we CUT BACK WIDE -- a ROAR OF BOOTS ON PAVEMENT as the thousand Stormtroopers TURN to face an endless snowy landscape. WHAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN?! EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY A view PAST THE RALLY. For a moment, nothing. Then, eerily SILENT, AN IMPOSSIBLE BLAST OF FIRE LIGHT -- LIKE AN ATOMIC BOMB TEST TIMES A ZILLION -- BLASTS FROM MILES AWAY, INTO THE SKY! Seconds later, a TERRIBLE EXPLOSIVE ROAR! The Troopers -- everyone -- is nearly PUSHED BACK by the FORCE of it -- the magnitude! Many have to COVER THEIR EYES! For MILES around the FIREBEAM, ICE AND SNOW MELTS INSTANTLY! Runoff tunnels FLOODED with AN OCEAN OF FRESH WATER. AIRBORNE CREATURES by the thousands burst from trees and take flight. Hux watches, his eyes WILD WITH POWER AND EVIL. From HIS eyes, CUT TO: INT. STAR DESTROYER BRIDGE - DAY TIGHT ON KYLO REN as he watches the Starkiller firing. EXT. MAZ' CASTLE - DAY Finn boards the Alien Freighter. The SOUND FROM THE SKY makes him turn back. He sees the PATH OF FIRE and his blood runs cold, his heart sinks. EXT. REPUBLIC SYSTEM - NIGHT At a massive distance we see PLANETS THE REPUBLIC CAPITAL SYSTEM -- INCREASINGLY LIT, THEN POWERFULLY HIT BY THE VAST FIREBLAST WHICH OBLITERATES IT ALL! EXT. REPUBLIC CITY - NIGHT The galaxy CENTER OF GOVERNMENT at NIGHT. Impressive structures. Senators and dignitaries look in uncomprehending horror to the night sky. LIGHT GROWING -- FROM A GREAT DISTANCE a CIRCLE OF FIRE -- LIKE A SMALL SUN APPEARING FROM NOWHERE AND GROWING CLOSE AND MASSIVE, TURNING NIGHT TO DAY! And in seconds THE FIRE BLOCKS OUT EVERYTHING ELSE, AND THE ENTIRE PLANET OF HOSNIAN PRIME IS INCINERATED! EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY A crowd of ALIENS files out from inside, all eyes on the FIRE IN THE SKY. Dozens of LANGUAGES exclaiming fear and horror. Find Han and Chewie moving out, looking up. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: FINN (O.S.) It was the Republic. Han and Chewie turn as Finn arrives, moving quickly through the crowd. With dread: FINN (CONT'D) The First Order, they've done it. Where's Rey? EXT. FOREST - DAY Rey races through the forest and finally comes to a stop, overwhelmed and exhausted. At an emotional breaking point, she has no idea where to go, who to turn to. Then she HEARS A BEEP -- turns to see BB-8, catching up with her. REY What are you doing? (he BEEPS) You have to go back. (he BEEPS again) REY (CONT'D) BB-8. No, you can't -- you have to go back, you're too important. They'll help you. Then, ANOTHER SOUND -- LOUDER NOW -- they LOOK UP AGAIN: in front of the system attack, A FLEET OF FIRST ORDER SHIPS ROAR OVERHEAD, TOWARD THE CASTLE! Rey's heart sinks: HER FRIENDS ARE IN DANGER! INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY Maz leads Han, Finn and Chewie down the hall, fast: MAZ I've had this for ages... MAZ'S CASTLE - TREASURE ROOM - DAY Maz opens the box -- holds out the lightsaber to Finn: MAZ Kept it locked away. HAN Where'd you get that? MAZ A good question for another time. (to Finn) Take it! Find your friend! Finn grabs it as the room is SHAKEN by an above ground attack. MAZ (CONT'D) Those beasts! They're here! EXT. FOREST - DAY Rey and BB-8 race fast back toward the castle -- EXPLOSION SOUNDS can be HEARD from the direction they're headed! EXT. FOREST - DAY Rey races through the trees -- sees Maz' castle -- BEING DESTROYED BY FIRST ORDER SHIPS! Aliens RUNNING, GETTING OBLITERATED by SCREAMING TIE FIGHTERS! Other TIE FIGHTERS and TRANSPORTERS LAND, STORMTROOPERS in attack. Just then, filtered RADIO CALLS get Rey's attention: nearby STORMTROOPERS have spotted her, AND FIRE! STORMTROOPER FN-417, hold position! Rey takes cover, grabs her BLASTER -- but IT WON'T FIRE! She panics, then realizes: REY Safety! SHE SWITCHES OFF THE SAFETY and FIRES BACK! HITS TWO TROOPERS and retreats, calls to BB-8: BB-8 follows Rey AWAY FROM THE CASTLE, firing back at more chasing Troopers! EXT. MAZ' CASTLE RUINS - DAY Kylo Ren moves through the DEBRIS. A Stormtrooper approaches: STORMTROOPER #4 Sir, the droid was spotted heading west, with a girl. Kylo Ren LOOKS BACK SHARPLY, in Rey's direction -- EXT. FOREST - DAY Rey and BB-8 move swiftly, terrified -- she stops them: REY You have to keep going, stay out of sight, I'll try to fight 'em off. (BB-8 BEEPS; bravely through her fear) I hope so, too. BB-8 BEEPS and heads off -- Rey RUNS and TAKES COVER behind a massive, mossy tree. TIGHT on her TERRIFIED FACE -- EXT. CASTLE DEBRIS - DAY Han, Chewie, Finn and Maz, exhausted, CLIMB UP, peek through debris. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: HAN Come on, Chewie! Maz turns to Finn: MAZ Rey and BB-8, they need you. Now go. FINN I need a weapon. Maz grabs his wrist -- holds up his hand -- THE SABER. MAZ You have one! He looks at her questioningly -- he's supposed to use the lightsaber?! He TURNS IT ON. HAN AND CHEWIE RUN, TAKE COVER from BLASTS, FIRING BACK at Stormtroopers, taking some out! HAN Hey, can I try that? Han borrows Chewbacca's bowcaster, fires on Stormtroopers and sends them flying. HAN (CONT'D) (to Chewbacca) I like this thing. FINN SURPRISES A STORMTROOPER WITH THE LIGHTSABER, then another! Untrained, he's athletic, brave, impressive. One Stormtrooper has a MACE -- STORMTROOPER Traitor! FINN and the TROOPER WITH THE MACE battle. The Mace Trooper KNOCKS FINN DOWN! The Stormtrooper is about to end him, when THE STORMTROOPER IS SHOT AND FALLS! Wide-eyed Finn sees Han run over, having fired the blast! Han helps him up. HAN You okay, Big deal? FINN Thanks! But TEN STORMTROOPERS come over a RISE, BLASTERS AIMED. STORMTROOPER Don't move! TK-338, we have targets in custody! (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: No way out, they DROP THEIR WEAPONS: TIGHT on the LIGHTSABER as it HITS THE GROUND. A STORMTROOPER HAND picks it up. Han's MIND RACES as a SQUAD OF TROOPERS appears behind them. Finn, Han and Chewie are MARCHED by Stormtroopers back toward a transport, hands on their heads. But then -- A FAMILIAR ROAR RIPPING ACROSS THE LAKE -- Han turns -- they all do: coming toward them across the water, XWINGS AND RESISTANCE SPACECRAFT APPEAR, BEGIN FIRING AT THE FIRST ORDER SHIPS! PUSH IN ON HAN, HOPE SURGING -- CHEWIE TALKS. STORMTROOPER (CONT'D) We have incoming at two-eight-pointsix! Move! Dispatch! Move! Scramble all squads! Repeat, scramble all squads! Anti-air cover en route to our position! HAN It's the Resistance. One X-WING in particular -- MARKED IN BLACK -- SWOOPS DOWN and takes out the parked TIE FIGHTERS and Troopers! INT. POE'S X-WING - DAY It's Poe Dameron at the stick of his X-wing. POE Go straight ahead and don't let these dogs scare you! JESS (V.O.) Copy that! SNAP (V.O.) We're with you, Poe! The Stormtroopers around Finn, Han and Chewie SCATTER, TOSSED in EXPLOSIONS! The LIGHTSABER LANDS AGAIN -- FINN PICKS IT UP. HAN Quick! Chewie picks up his Bowcaster, Han takes the blaster. Shoots a Trooper. FINN Woohoo! YEAH! That's one helluva pilot! INT. POE'S X-WING - DAY POE WOOHOO! EXT. FOREST - DAY In the darkened woods, Rey, terrified, keeps her blaster aimed. Her eyes dart around for her pursuer. And then: THE UNIQUE SOUND OF KYLO REN'S RASPING LIGHTSABER COMING TO LIFE -- A SOUND she's HEARD BEFORE in the FORCEBACK. Rey's heart skips a beat: she's even more scared now. Kylo Ren appears from behind a tree -- Rey FIRES again and again -- Kylo Ren moves toward her, USING HIS LIGHTSABER TO DEFLECT EVERY BLAST. She FIRES ferociously, but Kylo Ren keeps coming! His hand rises -- Rey suddenly STOPS -- GASPS -- UNABLE TO MOVE. KYLO REN The girl I've heard so much about. He walks AROUND HER, slowly, she won't let herself cry. KYLO REN (CONT'D) The droid. He comes around to see her face. After a scary beat he WHIPS HIS SABER UP TO HER EYES, ILLUMINATING HER FACE. KYLO REN (CONT'D) Where is it? WIDE SHOT: THE EPIC BATTLE BETWEEN RESISTANCE AND FIRST ORDER TROOPS, REFLECTED IN THE STILL LAKE. STORMTROOPER Request air support! EXT. FOREST - DAY Kylo Ren TURNS OFF HIS SABER, reaches up... and REACHES TOWARDS REY'S FACE. She can't move, strains in agony. After a beat, surprised by what he finds, he removes his hand. She is relieved but still afraid. KYLO REN The map. You've seen it. Rey is horrified. He TOUCHES HER FACE again: the pain, tears stream. Kylo Ren, taking more from her mind... She stares at him, TERRIFIED, straining in agony -- Kylo Ren, mid-interrogation, TURNS TOWARD THE SOUND OF THE EXPLOSIONS. Stormtroopers APPROACH through the woods. STORMTROOPER #5 Sir, Resistance fighters! We need more troops. Kylo Ren TURNS BACK TO Rey, his hand still on her face. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: KYLO REN Pull the division out. Forget the droid. We have what we need. A GESTURE from Kylo Ren and REY LOSES CONSCIOUSNESS, FALLS FROM FRAME! EXT. CASTLE DEBRIS - DAY The BLACK-MARKED X-WING SWOOPS DOWN again, FIRING, EXPLODING another TIE Fighter! On the ground: STORMTROOPER Pull back the tree line! Han and Chewie dodge debris, FIRING and TAKING OUT TROOPERS. FINN takes out 2 TROOPERS with the blaster, then, out of breath, turns to see: Kylo Ren in the forest, CARRYING REY IN HIS ARMS, INTO HIS SHUTTLE! Finn's heart SHATTERS -- Han stops -- turns -- sees Kylo Ren entering his shuttle. Han is ROCKED. FINN NO!! REY!!! Heroically, Finn runs toward the shuttle through LASER BLASTS AND EXPLOSIONS, but the shuttle TAKES OFF -- Finn irrationally CHASES IT, SCREAMS DESPERATELY: FINN (CONT'D) No, no, no, no... REY!! In crazed frustration, Finn stops running, watches the receding First Order ships, Rey their captive. EXT. FOREST - DAY BB-8 moves fast, then stops and looks up as the First Order ships RETREAT, OFF PLANET. A considered beat, and BB-8 heads BACK FOR THE CASTLE. EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE RUINS - DAY Post battle. Finn runs to Han: FINN He took her! Did you see that? He took her. She's gone! HAN (walks past) Yeah, yeah, I know... And he and Chewie head off. EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE RUINS - DAY Han moves toward a RESISTANCE TRANSPORT landing in the debris. BB-8 rolls up beside him, in wait for the transport. ON HAN'S FACE, knowing exactly what's about to happen. Finally, the transport door opens. And standing there is LEIA. She sees Han and is stunned. A silent beat, husband and wife reunited for the first time in years. In the smoke and embers, no one says a word. Then C-3PO walks out from the transport, into the field: C-3PO Goodness! Han Solo! It is I, SeeThreepio! (sees Han, stops) You probably don't recognize me because of the red arm. (sees Leia, increasingly awkward) Look who it is! Did you see who? Oh. Excuse me, Prin-- uh, General. Sorry. Come along, BB-8. Quickly. (BB-8 beeps) Yes, I must get my proper arm reinstalled. He hurries off. Finally, alone again. HAN You changed your hair. LEIA Same jacket. HAN No, new jacket. Chewie glad to see Leia, greets her with a hug. Chewie MOANS a few words, looks at Han then boards the ship. It is complicated and loving and painful. Han says, quietly: HAN (CONT'D) ... I saw him. Leia, I saw our son. He was here. Leia hears this. Maz watches through the smoke. EXT. SPACE - DAY The FALCON and surviving X-WINGS ROAR past camera toward a PLANET WITH GREEN FLORA AND A RING OF ASTEROIDS. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: This is D'QAR. EXT. D'QAR - DAY The SHIPS DESCENDING among grassy mounds and sunken structures. EXT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY LARGE GRASS MOUNDS cover HANGARS, beneath the odd, giant trees. BOOM DOWN as RESISTANCE GROUND CREW direct an X-WING to a LANDING. In the FOREGROUND, another X-wing canopy OPENS, a PILOT climbs out. PAN TO REVEAL the landed Millennium Falcon. Finn runs down the ramp, UP TO CAMERA, desperate, searching. Then BB-8 SPEEDS RIGHT PAST HIM, almost knocking him down -- Finn watches as BB-8 rolls over to the PILOT GETTING OUT OF THE BLACK-MARKED X-WING. The Pilot's helmet comes off. IT IS POE! Finn can't believe what he's seeing. And Poe, kneeling in WARM REUNION with BB-8, listens and reacts to something the droid tells him. Poe looks up and sees Finn -- and he can't believe it either! Poe smiles, points at Finn. From a distance, Finn gestures in sheer amazement that Poe is alive. FINN Poe. Poe Dameron. They move to each other -- and embrace. FINN (CONT'D) You're alive! POE So are you! FINN What happened to you? POE What happened? I got thrown from the crash, woke up at night -- no you, no ship, nothing-- BB-8 BEEPS -- Poe listens, turns to Finn. POE (CONT'D) BB-8 says that you saved him. FINN No, no, no. It wasn't just me. POE You completed my mission, Finn. That's my jacket? (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: FINN Oh here. POE No, no, no. Keep it. It suits you. You're a good man, Finn. FINN Poe -- I need your help. INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY MOVE FAST with Finn and Poe. Finn takes in this makeshift command center, buried deep among vines and roots. They arrive at Leia, who stands with a group of Resistance Officers, including ADMIRALS ACKBAR and STATURA: POE General Organa. Sorry to interrupt, this is Finn, he needs to talk to you -- LEIA (takes Finn's hand) And I need to talk to him. That was incredibly brave, what you did. Renouncing the First Order, saving this man's life -- FINN (surprised she knows) Thank you, ma'am -- but a friend of mine was taken prisoner-- LEIA Han told me about the girl, I'm sorry. Finn is startled -- Poe jumps in: POE Finn's familiar with the weapon that destroyed the Hosnian system. He worked on the base. LEIA We're desperate for anything you can tell us. FINN That's where my friend was taken -- I've got to get there, fast. LEIA And I will do everything I can to help, but first you must tell us all you know. INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY Chewbacca sits on a bed in the med bay. DR. KALONIA uses a device to help heal his shoulder. Chewie TALKS. DR. KALONIA (Chewie TALKS) That sounds very scary. (Chewie TALKS) You must be so brave. Chewie agrees. INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY C-3PO takes the DATA DEVICE from BB-8 and inserts it into a BASE COMPUTER. THE PROJECTED MAP APPEARS in HOLOGRAM. Leia enters, studying it, dispirited. PAN as she moves, REVEALING HAN. C-3PO is here and some others. C-3PO General, I regret to inform you, but this map recovered from BB-8 is only partially complete. And even worse, it matches no charted system on record. We simply do not have enough information to locate Master Luke. LEIA I can't believe I was so foolish to think that I could just find Luke and bring him home. HAN Leia... LEIA Don't do that. HAN Do what? She heads off. LEIA Anything. Flummoxed, Han follows looking at C-3PO. C-3PO Princesses. Han follows Leia across the base floor: HAN I'm trying to be helpful! (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: LEIA When did that ever help? And don't say the Death Star. HAN (Sighs) INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY LOW WITH BB-8 as he rolls over and finds, under a dark and dusty tarp in a corner, R2-D2. BB-8 BEEPS at R2, pulls off the tarp and tries to start a conversation. But R2 DOESN'T RESPOND AT ALL. BB-8 tries again. Nothing. BB-8 NUDGES R2. Nothing. Then: C-3PO (O.S.) BB-8. You're wasting your time. BB-8 looks up at C-3PO, who stands there. C-3PO SIGHS. C-3PO (CONT'D) It is very doubtful that R2 would have the rest of the map in his backup data. (BB-8 beeps) I am afraid not. R2-D2 has been in low power mode ever since Master Luke went away. Sadly, he may never be his old self again. INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY Leia hears the change in Han's voice and softens. She turns. HAN Listen to me, will you? I know every time you... every time you look at me, you're reminded of him. LEIA You think I want to forget him? I want him back! Han looks at her with sympathy. HAN There was nothing we could've done. (hard for him to say) There was too much Vader in him. LEIA That's why I wanted him to train with Luke. I just never should have sent him away. That's when I lost him. That's when I lost you both. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: HAN We both had to deal with it in our own way. I went back to the only thing I was ever good at. LEIA We both did. HAN We lost our son, forever. LEIA No. (long beat) It was Snoke. Han takes this in. LEIA (CONT'D) He seduced our son to the dark side. But we can still save him. Me. You. HAN If Luke couldn't reach him, how could I? LEIA Luke is a Jedi... you're his father. There's still light in him. I know it. GENERAL STATURA General, the reconnaissance report on the enemy base is coming. INT. STARKILLER BASE - HOLDING CELL - DAY Rey wakes, disoriented. She is in an angled, upright restraining rig. Looks over, startled to see Kylo Ren, mask in place, standing there. REY Where am I? KYLO REN (long beat) You're my guest. REY Where are the others? KYLO REN You mean the murderers, traitors and thieves you call friends? (Rey stares at him) You'll be relieved to hear that I have no idea. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: Rey studies him. She's fearful... but curious. KYLO REN (CONT'D) You still want to kill me. REY That happens when you're being hunted by a creature in a mask. Kylo Ren stops, considers her... then reaches up, unlatches and REMOVES HIS MASK. Rey reacts, stunned. It takes a moment before she regains her own mask of defiance. KYLO REN Tell me about the droid. REY (a nervous beat) He's a BB unit with a selenium drive and a thermal hyperscan vindicator -- KYLO REN He's carrying a section of a navigational chart. We have the rest, recovered from archives of the Empire. We need the last piece. And somehow, you convinced the droid to show it to you. You. A scavenger -- Rey reacts -- afraid -- how does he know? KYLO REN (CONT'D) You know I can take whatever I want. Trepidation flashes across Rey's eyes. Kylo Ren moves closer, his hand rising toward her. She recoils, but has nowhere to go. Kylo Ren nearly TOUCHES HER FACE... THEY'RE BOTH SURPRISED: they react to a feeling that passes between them -- AN ENERGY THEY RECOGNIZE IN EACH OTHER. And then it's gone. Adversaries again. Rey can't move, quietly strains in agony, trying to resist Ren's probing. KYLO REN (CONT'D) ... You're so lonely... so afraid to leave... (then, slight smile) At night, desperate to sleep... you imagine an ocean. I see it -- I see the island... Tears stream down her face as she resists. She tries to break free, but can't budge. KYLO REN (CONT'D) And Han Solo. You feel like he's the father you never had. He would've disappointed you. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: His hand still on her face, her eyes fierce through the agony: REY -- Get out of my head -- But this just makes Kylo lean closer. KYLO REN I know you've seen the map. It's in there... and now you'll give it to me. Don't be afraid. I feel it too. Where her strength comes from, she doesn't know, but: REY I'm not giving you anything. KYLO REN We'll see. He peers into her eyes intensely. She meets his gaze -- DESPITE THE PAIN SHE IS STRONG. On Ren's face as HIS CONFIDENCE BEGINS TO MELT AWAY. He has slammed up against a barrier in her mind. He looks less certain by the moment as Rey seems to GROW IN STRENGTH. The FEROCITY of confrontation builds until it hits critical mass AND REY DOES THE UNTHINKABLE! SHE ENTERS HIS HEAD, AMAZED AT WHAT SHE IS SEEING! REY ... You... you're afraid... that you will never be as strong as... Darth Vader! KYLO REN SUDDENLY WITHDRAWS HIS HAND, as if her face were FIRE HOT. TAKES A STEP BACK, CONFUSED, RATTLED. Rey's body is released, she breathes deeply, her powerful eyes still on Kylo Ren, who starts to leave. And we PRELAP: SNOKE (V.O.) This scavenger, resisted you? INT. STARKILLER PLANET - ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT Kylo Ren, mask off, stands before Snoke. KYLO REN She's strong with the Force, untrained but, stronger than she knows. And while Ren's mind no doubt goes to Luke: SNOKE And the droid? (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: Kylo Ren hesitates to reveal the truth. Then: GENERAL HUX (O.S.) Ren believed it was no longer valuable to us. Ren turns back -- Hux enters the large space, moves to the platform beside Ren. GENERAL HUX (CONT'D) That the girl was all we needed. As a result, the droid has most likely been returned to the hands of the enemy. They may have the map already. Snoke is visibly furious. SNOKE Then the Resistance must be destroyed before they get to Skywalker. GENERAL HUX We have their location. We tracked their reconnaissance ship to the Ileenium system. SNOKE Good. Then we will crush them once and for all. Prepare the weapon. Kylo Ren is stunned by the moment -- that isn't what he meant at all -- KYLO REN Supreme Leader. I can get the map from the girl. I just need your guidance. SNOKE If what you say about this girl is true, bring her to me. INT. STARKILLER BASE - HOLDING CELL - DAY SLOW PUSH IN ON REY, shackled, mind still racing over what's happened between her and Kylo Ren. She is flooded with emotions, feeling her potential, her strength, that in this moment of being restrained, perhaps anything is possible. She turns to the Stormtrooper Guard. Studies him for an intense beat. Then says: REY You will remove these restraints. And leave this cell, with the door open. The Stormtrooper Guard looks at her. A beat. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: TROOPER GUARD #2 What did you say? Rey's eyes stay trained on him. She shifts in her seat, her confidence wavering, but she repeats, with authority: REY You will remove these restraints. And leave this cell, with the door open. The Stormtrooper Guard, rifle aimed, MOVES FOR HER. Rey's heart pounds -- is she about to be killed, freed, or laughed at? The tension unbearable when the Guard says: TROOPER GUARD #2 I'll tighten those restraints, scavenger scum! INT. STARKILLER BASE - CORRIDOR 1 - DAY LOW ANGLE: Kylo Ren, masked, rounds a corner, PASSES US. INT. STARKILLER BASE - HOLDING CELL - DAY Rey stares intently at the trooper. Calms herself. And tries again. REY You will remove these restraints. And leave this cell, with the door open. TROOPER GUARD #2 I will remove these restraints. And leave this cell, with the door open. He reaches down and UNLATCHES THE RESTRAINTS. HE THEN TURNS AND STARTS TO HEAD OUT, her back to him as he exits. SHE IS IN SHOCK. Then tries, quickly: REY And you will drop your weapon. TROOPER GUARD #2 And I'll drop my weapon. The Trooper Guard DROPS HIS WEAPON without turning back -- Rey HEARS the gun fall. She's incredulous. The guard has LEFT THE CELL, ITS DOOR OPEN. REY, in ABSOLUTE DISBELIEF, MOVES QUICKLY OUT OF FRAME! INT. STARKILLER BASE - HOLDING CELL - DAY Kylo Ren enters the cell -- we PUSH IN ON HIM as he takes in the empty cell -- AND IMMEDIATELY UNDERSTANDS WHAT HAS HAPPENED. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: KYLO REN NO! Enraged, he RIPS OUT HIS SABER and -- EXT. STARKILLER BASE - CORRIDOR 1 - DAY WIDE ANGLE, empty corridor, toward the cell: we only HEAR the horrible SOUNDS. DESTRUCTION. YELLING. A few pieces of red hot DEBRIS BOUNCES into the corridor. Two STORMTROOPERS, crossing at the far end of the hall, STOP TO WATCH this display of pure FURY. They retreat, and fast. INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - DAY Workers at their controls. Vast snowy landscape seen outside. Their GAUGES RISE -- THE WEAPON CHARGING SLOWLY -- GENERAL HUX Begin charging the weapon! STARKILLER TECHNICIAN Yes, sir. Weapon charging. EXT. STARKILLER BASE PLANET - DAY A vast view of the planet -- a MASSIVE SOLARVAC ARRAY surrounds a port TEN MILES IN DIAMETER. MILLIONS OF PANELS turn on the ARRAY -- a wave of BRILLIANT REFLECTIONS. Suddenly, like a planetary-scale TESLA COIL LINE OF ENERGY, THE POWER OF THE SUN begins to TRAVEL DOWN to the Starkiller Base planet. INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY Finn, now a member of the inner circle of the Resistance, is huddled with the group around the MAP TABLE, which displays a WIREFRAME HOLOGRAM of a ROLLING VIEW OF THE SURFACE OF STARKILLER BASE. With Finn are Han, Leia, Poe, C-3PO, Statura, Ackbar, Brance, SNAP, MAJOR EMATT (60), NIEN NUNB, and others. An urgent, messy strategy session -- POE The scan data from Snap's reconnaissance flight confirms Finn's report. SNAP They've somehow created a hyper lightspeed weapon built within the planet itself. BRANCE A laser cannon? (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: SNAP We're not sure how to describe a weapon of this scale. MAJOR EMATT (horrible memories) It's another Death Star. POE I wish that were the case, Major. Poe hits a control. A WIREFRAME OF THE DEATH STAR APPEARS. POE (CONT'D) This was the Death Star. Poe hits another control -- the Death Star SHRINKS -- AND SHRINKS AND SHRINKS, as the SURFACE AREA OF THE STARKILLER BASE IS DRAWN INTO A LARGER IMAGE, REVEALING THE ENTIRE BASE PLANET. The Death Star is a minuscule SATELLITE in comparison. POE (CONT'D) This is Starkiller Base. This is news to many here, and they're stunned. HAN So it's big. ADMIRAL ACKBAR How is it possible to power a weapon of this size? FINN It uses the power of the sun. As the weapon is charged, the sun is drained until it disappears. An OFFICER runs up, hands Leia a DATACARD. LEIA (eyes on datacard) The First Order: they're charging the weapon again, now. (then, heart sinking) Our system is the next target. C-3PO Oh my. Without the Republic fleet, we're doomed. They all react to this horrible news. HAN Okay, how do we blow it up? (all eyes on him) There's always a way to do that. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: But no one has anything. Leia watches the silence, frustrated. Finally, rallying them: LEIA Han's right. Han is surprised. ADMIRAL STATURA (at first hesitant) In order for that amount of power to be contained, that base would need some kind of thermal oscillator... FINN There is one. All eyes on Finn as he moves around the hologram to a location on the Starkiller Base -- it is ZOOMED IN: A GIANT BLACK HEXAGONAL STRUCTURE. FINN (CONT'D) Precinct 47. Here. ADMIRAL STATURA (hypothesizing) If we can destroy that oscillator, it might de-stabilize the core and cripple the weapon. MAJOR EMATT ... Maybe the planet. Poe then tries to bolster spirits, looking at the BIG HEXAGONAL STRUCTURE: the Oscillator. POE We'll go in there and we'll hit that oscillator with everything we got. ADMIRAL ACKBAR They have defensive shields that our ships cannot penetrate. HAN We disable the shields. (to Finn) Kid, you worked there, what do you got? FINN (beat, then:) I can do it. HAN I like this guy. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: FINN I can disable the shields. But I have to be there, on the planet-- HAN We'll get you there. LEIA Han, how? HAN If I told you, you wouldn't like it. POE So we disable the shields, take out the oscillator and we blow up their big gun. All right. Let's go! And everyone splits. EXT. HANGARS, RESISTANCE BASE - DAY SERIES OF SHOTS: THE RESISTANCE FLEET PREPARES FOR ITS MISSION. Pilots inspect crafts, including Snap, Nien Nunb, and Poe at his black-marked X-wing. Mechanics make adjustments as Crews fuel the jets. Ground controllers move ships into takeoff formation. Pilots prep their ships, including BB-8, who is PULLED INTO Poe's black X-wing. Finn approaches Poe wearing the jacket. Poe slaps Finn's shoulder as he heads off. Finn watches Poe, despite it all, a little laugh. Over this: EXT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY Chewie and Finn follow Han's orders as they prepare the Falcon for one more daring run, maybe its last: HAN Chewie, check that donal capitator. Come on. Let's go. -- Finn, be careful with those - they're explosives. FINN Now you tell me? LEIA No matter how much we fought, I've always hated watching you leave. Han looks over, there's Leia. HAN That's what I did it. So you'd miss me. She laughs, moves up close to him. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: LEIA I did miss you. He looks at her, says sweetly, out of the blue: HAN It wasn't all bad, was it? Huh? Some of it was...good. LEIA ... Pretty good. HAN Some things never change. LEIA (smiles) True. You still drive me crazy. Han places his hands on her shoulders. It could be thirty years ago. They both know there's a good chance he won't make it back. They pull each other tight, holding for dear life. Quietly, longingly: LEIA (CONT'D) If you see our son again, bring him home. INT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY STORMTROOPER Sir, sensors triggered in hangar 718. We're searching the area. KYLO REN She's just beginning to test her powers. The longer it takes to find her, the more dangerous she becomes. Kylo exits. INT. STARKILLER BASE - ATRIUM AREA - DAY TIGHT ON REY'S FACE as she peers nervously around a corner. Rey runs down a long, glossy hall, taking cover in an alcove, the Trooper Guard's rifle HELD TIGHT. EXT. LIGHTSPEED SPACE - DAY The Falcon SCREAMS PAST -- INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY Flying at LIGHTSPEED, Finn, with Han and Chewie. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: FINN How are we getting in? HAN Their shields have a fractional refresh rate. Keeps anything traveling slower than lightspeed from getting through. Finn is suddenly filled with dread. FINN We're gonna make our landing approach at lightspeed?! Chewie, thinking it's crazy too, says: HELL YES WE ARE! HAN Alright, Chewie, get ready. Chewie GROANS: he's ready. Han studies the PANEL INDICATORS. HAN (CONT'D) And Now! Chewie and Han hit switches -- EXT. LIGHTSPEED SPACE/STARKILLER BASE - DAY The Falcon's ENVIRONMENT SHIFTS INSTANTLY FROM LIGHTSPEED TO PLANET ATMOSPHERE -- it's suddenly FLYING 100 FEET ABOVE THE SNOWY, ROCKY GROUND, HEADED FOR A THICK FOREST! INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY Chewie GROANS: HAN I AM PULLING UP!!! EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY But the Falcon has no time -- it PLOWS through the trees! It then RISES -- INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY ALARMS BLARE as the ship SLAMS THROUGH BRANCHES, SHOOTS TOWARD SKY! Han does his best to steer -- Chewie GROANS -- in the madness Han YELLS: HAN I get any higher, they'll see us! And the ship DIVES again, back into the trees! EXT. STARKILLER BASE - CLEARING - DAY A quiet CLEARING on the forest TREELINE. Suddenly the MILLENNIUM FALCON HURTLES OUT OF THE FOREST! From an eruption of BRANCHES and PINE, the ship DIVES -- SLAMS INTO THE SNOW! It DIGS THROUGH A THOUSAND YARDS OF WHITE until it finally comes to a canted stop, half buried in the snow! INT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY OFFICER Sir, she was not found in hangar 718 but all troops are on alert. KYLO REN Put every hangar on lock-down. She's going to try to steal a ship to-- Suddenly, Kylo senses something. Something familiar. KYLO REN (CONT'D) Han Solo... EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY MASSIVE WIDE SHOT of an EPIC SNOWSCAPE. Han, Finn and Chewie cross the terrain. WALKERS appears on the horizon. Han, Finn and Chewie take cover behind a base structure. Chewie carries a BLACK DUFFEL of EXPLOSIVES. FINN The flooding tunnels are over that ridge. We'll get in that way. HAN What was your job when you were based here? FINN Sanitation. HAN Sanitation? Then how do you know how to disable the shields? FINN I don't. I'm just here to get Rey. HAN People are counting on us! The galaxy is counting on us--! FINN Solo, we'll figure it out! We'll use the Force! HAN That's not how the Force works--! (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: Chewie MOANTALKS. HAN (CONT'D) Oh really, you're cold? FINN Come on! They follow Finn on the snowy hike. On the horizon, THE LASER SIPHON SHOOTING INTO THE SKY, SLOWLY SUCKING THE SUN DRY. INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - DAY Technicians at work, the SUN SUCKING seen in the window behind him. GENERAL HUX Report. FIRST ORDER OFFICER Weapon charged in fifteen minutes, sir. INT. STARKILLER BASE - CORRIDOR 4 - DAY A STORMTROOPER waits to board a Transport Compartment. The door WHOOSHES open -- HAN, FINN and CHEWIE are there! STORMTROOPER FN-9330 Hey! He fumbles for his blaster but Chewie shoots first. WIDE ANGLE of the corridor as the Trooper flies back, dead. Chewie drags him out of sight. Han and Finn peer around a corner, wary. HAN The longer we're here, less luck we're going to have. The shields? FINN I have an idea about that. Han and Chewie follow Finn. INT. STARKILLER BASE - CORRIDOR - DAY Captain Phasma heads down a corridor, distant Stormtroopers. Suddenly Phasma is T-BONED HARD AND FAST -- SHOVED OUT OF FRAME BY CHEWIE! And now we're in a NARROW CROSS-CORRIDOR, CHEWIE WITH HIS ARMS AROUND PHASMA, FORCED TO FACE FINN, WHO HOLDS HIS BLASTER ON HIS FORMER CAPTAIN. Han stands behind Finn. FINN Remember me? (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: CAPTAIN PHASMA FN-2187. FINN Not anymore. The name's Finn, and I'm in charge. I'm in charge now, Phasma. I'm in charge. HAN Bring it down. Bring it down. FINN Follow me. Finn SMILES as we CUT TO: INT. STARKILLER BASE - ATRIUM AREA - DAY TIGHT ON REY'S FACE as she peers nervously around a corner. Rey runs down a long, glossy hall, taking cover in an alcove, the Trooper Guard's rifle HELD TIGHT. From this alcove, she can see down another LONG, PERPENDICULAR WALKWAY -- on one side, a STONE AND STEEL WALL. On the other side, a VAST ATRIUM, with a railing-free DROP OFF, the white pill-light design descending HUNDREDS OF FEET. At the end of this walkway is an OPEN HANGAR DOOR, revealing HUNDREDS OF TIE FIGHTERS parked outside. TIGHT on Rey's face as her plan is clear. But the problem: between her and the ship she wants to steal, is a GROUP OF STORMTROOPERS. Guards, in conversation. As she tries to think about what to do next, we see, FAR BEHIND HER in the perpendicular hall, ANOTHER GROUP OF STORMand SNOWTROOPERS headed her way! Rey's mind races -- another peek out and she RUNS FAST, across the walkway, and CLIMBS DOWN -- her fingertips disappearing over the edge just as the Troopers approach and continue. WIDE SHOT as Rey holds on carefully as the guards walk off, not seeing her over the edge, a death drop below her. But then she SEES SOMETHING and has a brainstorm. She strenuously cross-climbs to an invisible SERVICE HATCH, which She opens, and climbs INSIDE THE WALL, closing the hatch behind her. INT. STARKILLER BASE - INSIDE THE WALLS - DAY A REMARKABLE IMAGE, inside the inner workings of the base. Tiny by comparison, Rey climbs amid the incredible infrastructure, a drop to infinity beneath her. She is between the LIGHT SOURCE and the WHITE PILL SHAPES, as she makes her way ACROSS. INT. STARKILLER BASE - ATRIUM AREA - DAY WIDE SHOT of the Stormtrooper GUARDS, above the drop off into the atrium. What they cannot see is a SHADOWED SILHOUETTE OF REY against the ENDLESS WHITE PILL LIGHTS as she climbs across the space, beneath them, toward her exit! INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ACCESS POINT - DAY CLOSE AS PHASMA SITS INTO FRAME in front of a WORKSTATION -- Finn, Han and Chewie, blasters aimed. Phasma reluctantly works controls on the workstation. FINN You want me to blast that bucket off your head? Lower the shields. CAPTAIN PHASMA You're making a big mistake. FINN Do it. Chewie MOAN/TALKS. Phasma hits a few more buttons -- the controls BEEP-CLICK. ""SHIELDS DISABLE INITIATE"". Eyes on the workstation: FINN (CONT'D) Solo, if this works, we're not going to have a lot of time to find Rey. HAN Don't worry kid, we won't leave here without her. The controls BEEP-CLICK. ""SHIELDS DISABLED"". CAPTAIN PHASMA (to Finn, cruel) You can't be so stupid as to think this will be easy. My troops will storm this block and kill you all. FINN I disagree. What do we do with her? HAN Is there a garbage chute? Trash compactor? FINN Yeah, there is... INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY An ALERT: OFFICERS at their consoles, OVERLAPPING, urgent. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: OFFICER General, their shields are down! C-3PO Thank the Maker! LEIA Han did it! Send them in! ADMIRAL STATURA Give Poe full authorization to attack. REAR ADMIRAL GULCH Black Leader, go to sub-lights. On your call. INT. X-WING - DAY At LIGHTSPEED, Poe pilots: POE Roger, base -- red squad, blue squad, take my lead. INT. X-WING - DAY Nien Nunb pilots, acknowledges order in alien language. INT. X-WING - DAY Another pilot, ZOLO ZIFF. YOLO ZIFF Dropping out of lightspeed. EXT. SPACE/STARKILLER BASE - DAY With CONCUSSIVE BLASTS, the X-WINGS APPEAR and ROAR PAST CAMERA toward the Starkiller Base planet! EXT. STARKILLER BASE - CLEARING - DAY The CRASHED FALCON, two parked TIE FIGHTERS and a TROOP TRANSPORT VEHICLE beside it. EXT. STARKILLER BASE - CLEARING - DAY At a distance, the X-WINGS DROP FROM THE SKY, TOWARD THE HEXAGONAL OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE IN THE DISTANCE! EXT. STARKILLER BASE - ABOVE OSCILLATOR - DAY The squad of X-wings DIVE BOMBS the Oscillator, the Black Falcon leads. INTERCUT BETWEEN THIS AND VARIOUS X-WINGS. INT. X-WING - DAY Poe pilots: POE Almost in range! Hit the target dead center, as many runs as we can get! INT. X-WING - DAY Snap pilots. SNAP Approaching target. INT. X-WING - DAY Nien Nunb acknowledges. INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - DAY LARGE EXPLOSIONS atop the DISTANT OSCILLATOR, seen through the large windows! ALARMS BLARE in here -- we PULL BACK as Hux moves quickly to see the damage, he turns sharply to a First Order Officer: GENERAL HUX Dispatch all squadrons... COLONEL DATOO Yes, General. INT. X-WING - DAY POE Let's light it up! DIVE BOMBING THE OSCILLATOR, HITTING IT DEAD CENTER IN QUICK SUCCESSION! INT. X-WING - DAY LT. BASTIAN Direct hit! ELLO ASTY But no damage! Jess reacts. POE Yeah, we gotta keep hitting it! Another bombing run! Remember, when that sun is gone, that weapon will be ready to fire! But as long as there's light, we got a chance. INT. X-WING - DAY A BEEPING from BB-8, riding in the back of his X-wing, and Poe looks out -- can't believe what he's seeing: DOZENS OF TIE FIGHTERS! POE Guys, we got a lot of company! INT. STARKILLER BASE - JUNCTION AREA - DAY Finn, Han and Chewie take cover, Chewie pulling some EXPLOSIVES out of the duffel. Blast doors nearby. FINN We'll use the charges to blow that blast door. I'll go in and draw fire, but I'm gonna need cover. HAN You sure you're up for this? FINN Hell no -- I'll go in find and try to find Rey -- (improvising, fast) -- The troopers'll be on our tail. We have to be ready for that. There's an access tunnel that'll leads -- (Han starts pointing with his chin to something behind Finn) Why are you doing that? Why are you doing -- this? I'm trying to come up with a plan. Finn turns -- AND SEES REY, CLIMBING OUT FROM INSIDE THE WALL, carefully climbing back up to the main level! He can't believe it! Chewie MURMURS his relief. Han is maybe more grateful than anyone. INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY A Resistance Technician turns to Leia: ADMIRAL ACKBAR The Oscillator's still standing. OFFICER X-wings coming back for another round of attacks! INT. STARKILLER BASE - CORRIDOR 6 - DAY Rey climbs up to the corridor, vigilant. She hears a SOUND, SWOOPS her rifle at -- Finn, Han and Chewie! She cannot believe it! All Finn wants to do is hug her -- and she him. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: HAN Are you all right? REY Yeah. HAN Good. FINN What happened -- did he hurt you? REY Finn. What are you doing here?! FINN We came back for you. She is speechless -- this is all she's ever wanted anyone to do. Chewie TALKS -- and Rey's eyes nearly tear up. FINN (CONT'D) What'd he say? REY (shrugs, smiles, though nearly in tears) ... That it was your idea. Finn awkwardly smiles. It's his nature. They embrace. REY (CONT'D) Thank you. FINN How did you get away? REY I can't explain it. And you wouldn't believe it. HAN Escape now. Hug later. EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY The X-Wings DOGFIGHT with the TIE Fighters on the surface of the snowy planet. INTERCUT BETWEEN the ships SCREAMING past each other, and the COCKPITS of the Resistance and First Order fighters. Poe's fighter NEARLY COLLIDES with a closepassing TIE Fighter! SNAP I got one behind me. See it? JESS Yeah, I'm on it! (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: A heavy cannon emplacement launches a missile that shreds an X-wing fighter. JESS Furillo's been hit! SNAP Watch out for ground fire! EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY The X-wings ROAR across the sky, BLASTING and DODGING the TIE Fighters and missiles. PULL BACK TO REVEAL Han, Finn, Rey and Chewie, who run out here, into the snow, stopping, eyes on the sky, watching the lop-sided battle. THE FOUR HEROES TURN TO EACH OTHER, RESOLVE IN THEIR EYES. A long moment of communication. HAN They're in trouble. We can't leave. (to Finn, re: Chewie) My friend here has a bag full of explosives. Let's use 'em. INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY A Resistance Technician turns to Leia: KAYDEL KO CONNIX General, are you seeing this? VOBER DAND Two more X-wings down. That's half our fleet destroyed. C-3PO And their weapon will be fully charged in 10 minutes! It would take a miracle to save us now. INT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS Han and Chewie arrive here to find THREE SECURITY STORMTROOPERS approaching a Maintenance Hatch. Instantly, Chewie takes out the middle one with his Bowcaster. Han and the other two Stormtroopers OPEN FIRE, but Han's aim is true. ALARMS START BLARING! INT. JUNCTION STATION - NEAR DARKNESS Running inside from a parked snowspeeder, Rey opens a service hatch. Finn behind her, as she reaches into the mechanics of the place, very much like the very first shot we saw of Rey. And she YANKS a piece of TECH from the machinery and: INT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS The HATCH OPENS! Han and Chewie, having been on the lookout, step inside, weapons poised. Chewie MOANS. HAN That girl knows her stuff. INT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS Han and Chewie divide the explosives. Talk in hushed tones. HAN We'll set the charges at every other column. He GROAN/TALKS to Han, who looks around, reconsiders. HAN (CONT'D) You're right. That's a better idea. (checks his detonator) You take the top. (Chewie does) I'll go down below. Detonator. We'll meet back here. They head off in opposite directions. INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS Han finishes placing an explosive. Checks he's all-clear and hurries down to the next level. Chewie climbs up a level. INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - MAIN ENTRANCE - NEAR DARKNESS A SQUAD of Stormtroopers SNAP to alert as Kylo Ren approaches. CONTROLS ARE HIT and the huge DOOR OPENS. Without hesitation, Kylo walks INTO THE OSCILLATOR. INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS A COLOSSAL CYLINDRICAL STRUCTURE. DARK CORRIDORS and CATWALKS. Kylo Ren comes to a stop. Scans the structure. SENSING SOMETHING, he motions the Stormtrooper Squad upwards. KYLO REN Find them. They rush past him. Kylo Ren turns slowly, and HEADS DOWN. INT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS The Stormtroopers move up the ramp, weapons ready, checking carefully where blind corners intersect from the perimeter. They come round to the next higher level and PASS CLOSE TO CAMERA. When they've passed, TILT to find CHEWIE, in the shadows of the grillwork. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: Once they're gone, he plants another charge. EXT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS The Snowspeeder comes to a stop outside the structure. Finn and Rey stop for a moment, look to the sky: THE SUN IS NEARLY GONE. INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - LOWER LEVEL - NIGHT Han finishes setting a charge and is about to move on when he HEARS SOMETHING and conceals himself behind a wide, vertical support. He peaks around the edge and his whole demeanor changes -- HAN'S POV: Kylo Ren appears and stops at the railing, looking down into the filter. Han looks at his son with a tortured storm of feelings. WE'RE WITH KYLO REN as he resumes his hunt. He heads directly toward WHERE HAN IS HIDING! Kylo Ren has an INCREASING SENSE OF HAN'S PRESENCE as he moves closer. He comes to where Han was hiding -- but HAN IS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN. From his hiding place in a narrow, POWER CHAMBER in the wall, HAN WATCHES HIS SON PASS ONLY A FEW FEET IN FRONT OF HIM. Han SHIFTS HIS POSITION in the tight compartment, so he can watch Ren's progress. Kylo Ren turns onto a FLAT BRIDGE THAT BISECTS the open space. Unaware of his father, Kylo Ren walks purposefully across to the opposite side. Han watches his son walk off -- the CLANKCLANK of Kylo Ren's boots receding. This is Han's opportunity to escape but Leia's words echo through his mind. He makes a decision and moves out, to the edge of the catwalk. He calls out, strongly: HAN Ben! The name ECHOES as Kylo Ren STOPS, far across the vast catwalk. He turns. KYLO REN Han Solo. I've been waiting for this day for a long time. Finn and Rey make their way into the space, opening a HATCH that allows A BEAM OF PRECIOUS SUNLIGHT to stream down like a spotlight on Han and his son. Finn and Rey get to a railing and look down. They can SEE and HEAR Han and Kylo Ren on the catwalk below. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: HAN Take off that mask. You don't need it. KYLO REN What do you think you'll see if I do? Han moves toward Kylo Ren. HAN The face of my son. Kylo TAKES OFF HIS MASK. Han is JOLTED -- seeing the face of his son for the first time as a man. KYLO REN Your son is gone. He was weak and foolish, like his father. So I destroyed him. HAN That's what Snoke wants you to believe but it's not true. My son is alive. SEVERAL LEVELS BELOW them, CHEWIE comes to the rail to watch. INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - LOWER LEVEL - NEAR DARKNESS Kylo flares. KYLO REN No. The Supreme Leader is wise. UP ABOVE, Finn, Chewie and Rey watch, rapt. Stormtroopers dot the perimeter of the structure, watching the scene. ON THE BRIDGE, Han moves closer, stern: HAN Snoke is using you for your power. When he gets what he wants, he'll crush you -- you know it's true. Kylo hesitates. Somehow, he does know it. KYLO REN It's too late. HAN No it's not. Leave here with me. Come home. We miss you. For the first time, Kylo Ren seems truly conflicted. Tears flood his stoic eyes... KYLO REN I'm being torn apart. I want to be free of this pain. INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - DARKNESS FALLS Han takes one step toward his son, but stops himself. KYLO REN I know what I have to do, but I don't know if I have the strength to do it. Will you help me? Han hears his son's voice again, pained and vulnerable. HAN Yes. Anything. Kylo Ren unholsters his lightsaber and SLOWLY EXTENDS IT to Han, within a foot of Han's chest. Han almost can't believe it. The moment seems to last forever. And just then, the LAST BEAM OF SUNLIGHT streaming through the open hatch VANISHES. Han actually smiles -- and reaches out for the dark weapon -- but with the light now gone, KYLO REN'S EYES FILL WITH DARKNESS, HE IGNITES THE LIGHTSABER -- THE FIERY BLADE SHOOTS OUT, RIGHT THROUGH HAN'S CHEST AND BACK! KYLO REN Thank you. ABOVE, Finn and Rey GASP -- SCREAM -- FINN (Panting) Solo. REY (also panting) No, no. Han's last moment is looking into his son's face. HAN'S KNEES BUCKLE. The blade tilts down with him... until KYLO REN EXTINGUISHES IT AND HAN HOLDS onto the catwalk -- his life slipping away. Finally Han FALLS BACK, OFF THE CATWALK, INTO THE DEPTHS OF THE STRUCTURE! INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY Leia, feeling it instantly -- knowing -- drops into a seat, DEVASTATED. INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NIGHT Kylo Ren is somehow WEAKENED by this wicked act. Himself horrified. His SHOCK is broken only when -- CHEWIE CRIES OUT IN AGONY! Chewie furiously FIRES AT KYLO REN, HITTING HIM IN THE SIDE! Kylo Ren falls back, stunned. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: Our MUSIC TAKES OVER, EPIC AND HEARTBREAKING as Stormtroopers FIRE AT CHEWIE, who is forced to retreat down a corridor, where he holds the EXPLOSIVE REMOTE -- he PUSHES THE BUTTON! Hearing ONLY OUR SCORE, FIRST ONE, then TWO, then FOUR, then SIX EXPLOSIONS rock the structure -- CATWALKS FALL as the walls CAVE IN! Kylo Ren SEES REY AND FINN, WATCHING THE EXPLOSIONS IN SHOCK -- then they SEE KYLO REN, WHO RECOGNIZES THEM BOTH, WITH ASTONISHMENT. He rises to his full height and heads for them with long strides. Stormtroopers begin to BLAST AWAY AT REY AND FINN! CRAZED, REY FIRES BACK AS BLASTS HIT AROUND HER. FINN WRAPS AN ARM AROUND HER AND DRAGS/CARRIES HER OUT OF SIGHT! INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY ADMIRAL ACKBAR The Oscillator's been damaged but is still functional. COMMODORE META reacts. OFFICER TABALA ZO Admiral, their weapon will fire in two minutes. EXT. FOREST - NIGHT From a distance the oscillator is ablaze and fractured from the explosives. Then Rey and Finn appear, coming over a rising, running into a bare-tree snowy forest. FINN The Falcon's this way. Finn and Rey, overcome with emotion, race through the snowy forest -- until Finn SLOWS AND STOPS. Rey stops too, both out of breath. They look at each other. They both know: they can't run. EXT. STARKILLER BASE - FOREST - NIGHT Kylo Ren moves through the trees -- until he STOPS. Takes out the saber, ignites it. A still figure amidst the gusts of wind and snow. STANDING THIRTY FEET AWAY, FACING HIM, ARE FINN AND REY. Finn holds LUKE'S LIGHTSABER, Rey the Stormtrooper BLASTER. KYLO REN We're not done yet. REY You're a monster! (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: KYLO REN It's just us now. Han Solo can't save you. After a beat, Rey moves forward with the blaster -- AIMS IT! Kylo Ren RAISES A HAND -- Rey struggles under his FORCE POWER -- she can't fire -- he strains too, especially with the WOUND Chewie inflicted. Kylo Ren GESTURES POWERFULLY -- Rey's BLASTER FLIES OUT OF HER HAND -- another GESTURE and Rey FLIES BACK and SLAMS INTO A TREE thirty feet away! She drops -- LANDS HARD in the snow. Dazed, hurt. FINN Rey! Rey! Rey... Rey... Oh no. Oh no no no... Finn turns to her, afraid and concerned. But the SOUND OF KYLO REN'S LIGHTSABER moving makes Finn TURN BACK TO KYLO REN, lit by the glowing YELLOW AND RED BLADE. KYLO REN TRAITOR! In reply, Finn TURNS ON LUKE'S LIGHTSABER -- upon seeing the weapon, Kylo Ren REACTS IN SHOCK. KYLO REN (CONT'D) That lightsaber. It belongs to me! FINN Come get it. Despite his fear, Finn raises his blade in welcome. Kylo Ren CHARGES at him - Finn terrified -- Kylo Ren LUNGES but Finn DEFLECTS Ren's SPARK-SPITTING blade! Kylo Ren TURNS, ATTACKS, CUTS -- amazingly Finn BLOCKS, COUNTER-ATTACKS -- clearly IMPRESSES KYLO REN, who only enjoys this challenge more! Rey RECOVERS, gets her bearings. Her eyes focus on the two men fighting, through the trees. Kylo Ren is obviously hampered by his wound, yet he attacks with a primal SAVAGERY -- Finn BLOCKS, turning DEFENSIVE moves into OFFENSIVE ones. And he ACTUALLY GETS A HIT IN! LUKE'S SABER GRAZING KYLO REN'S ARM! Kylo MOVES BACK -- wounded, but more enraged than weakened. Kylo Ren CHARGES AGAIN -- their WEAPONS POUND, SPARKS FLY, their blades LOCK, the men are CLOSE, LIT BY the powerful, CRASHING sabers: And Kylo Ren PUSHES FINN BACK, attacks with pure ferocity -- Finn is stunned -- unprepared for this fierceness. Rey sees this -- Kylo Ren unleashes a MERCILESS SERIES OF BLOWS, pushing Finn further and further back until he loses balance. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: That's when KYLO REN STRIKES: HE LANDS A BLOW TO FINN'S TORSO -- LUKE'S LIGHTSABER FLIES FROM FINN'S HAND, THROWN TWENTY FEET! Kylo Ren TURNS OFF HIS LIGHTSABER and REACHES FOR LUKE'S LIGHTSABER -- BECKONING IT WITH THE FORCE. LUKE'S LIGHTSABER VIBRATES IN THE SNOW. Kylo Ren GESTURES, INCREASES HIS POWER -- LUKE'S LIGHTSABER FINALLY FLIES OUT OF THE SNOW, BULLETS TOWARD KYLO REN -- -- AND SPEEDS PAST HIM! KYLO REN TURNS TO SEE LUKE'S LIGHTSABER LAND IN THE HAND OF REY, WHO STANDS, FACING HIM, HAVING REACHED FOR IT HERSELF, BUT UTTERLY STUNNED THAT IT LANDED IN HER HAND! SHE IS SHOCKED -- AND SO IS KYLO REN! Holding it with both hands, SHE IGNITES LUKE'S LIGHTSABER FOR THE FIRST TIME, HER EYES BLAZING. Kylo Ren IGNITES HIS SABER. It's REY who charges now -- Kylo Ren immediately on the defensive. They BATTLE POWERFULLY -- He is clearly rocked by her raw, innate skill. INT. X-WING - NIGHT NIV LEK We just lost R-1! JESS We're overwhelmed! What do we do? It isn't working! Another pilot looks down -- SEES THE EXPLOSION -- coming from the OSCILLATOR. Relatively small, it's an opening: YOLO ZIFF Black Leader, there's a brand new hole in that oscillator. Looks like our friends got in! POE Red Four! Red Six! Cover us! LT. BASTIAN I'm on it! ELLO ASTY Roger! POE Everybody else, hit the target hard! Give it everything you got! And the X-WINGS DIVE and BLAST the OSCILLATOR -- EXT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR - NIGHT Another two X-wings -- including Poe's -- soar through the trench leading to the oscillator structure! POE I need some help here! I need some help! LT. BASTIAN I'm coming in! JESS Watch out! ELLO ASTY I'm hit! The alien pilot's X-wing is blasted to pieces. POE All teams - I'm going in! Pull up and cover me! NIV LEK Copy that, Black Leader! Good luck, Poe! The trailing X-wings peel off as Poe's black fighter darts into the fiery breach. INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - NEAR DARKNESS Outside, the SUN ALMOST COMPLETELY GONE -- PULL BACK THROUGH THE WINDOW TO REVEAL A STARKILLER TECHNICIAN: STARKILLER TECHNICIAN Weapon at full capacity in thirty seconds. GENERAL HUX Prepare to fire. EXT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR - NIGHT Poe's X-wing weaves through the breach. A pursuing TIE fighter does not clear the gap, leaving Poe to circle the interior of the unguarded structure, firing volley after volley of torpedoes. EXT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR - NIGHT The remaining X-Wings -- including Poe's -- BLAST the place -- and the structure begins to CRATER, deep underground EXPLOSIONS! EXT. FOREST - NIGHT Amid the BARE WHITE TREES, ONLY TWO LIGHTSABERS -- LUKE'S BLUE AND REN'S YELLOW-RED -- ILLUMINATE the FLURRIES OF SNOW as Rey and Kylo Ren BATTLE HARD. She seems to be, impossibly, STRONGER THAN HE IS for half a dozen blows -- until he FINDS HIS STRENGTH and FIGHTS BACK -- MOVING FORWARD and PUSHING REY BACK, into the forest. Suddenly a COLOSSAL CHUNK OF THE FOREST RIGHT BEHIND REY DROPS AWAY! Rey is suddenly fighting on the EDGE OF A MASSIVE, BRAND NEW CLIFF! KYLO REN You need a teacher! I can show you the ways of the Force! REY The Force. Rey closes her eyes for a long beat. When Rey opens them, she is centered, fortified, and she POUNDS BACK, SINGLE HANDED SWIPES, hitting Ren's gnarly, spitting saber with incredible FORCE. It's so fast now, so furious, that Kylo Ren FALLS BACK -- She ATTACKS HARDER! Ren gets up again but she HITS HIS SABER'S HILT -- HIS BLADE GOES FLYING OFF, TUMBLING INTO THE SNOW -- and she SLASHES AGAIN AND AGAIN AND HITS KYLO REN SQUARE IN THE HEAD AND CHEST. HE GOES DOWN, SUDDENLY A FEARFUL MAN, A LARGE BURN SCAR SLASHED ACROSS HIS FACE! He still reaches for his saber. And she could kill him -- right now, with ONE VICIOUS STRIKE! But she stops. Realizing she stands on a greater edge than even the cliff -- the edge of the dark side. The earth SHAKES. The earth splits. A gully forms. INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT The area where the RALLY was held is now COLLAPSING into a giant sink hole! We WHIP PAN to a YOUNG TECHNICIAN, who watches this out the control room window in horror. He hurries off, passing COLONEL DATOO, who admonishes: COLONEL DATOO Lieutenant, get back to your station! YOUNG TECHNICIAN (stops, fleetingly) Just look. We won't survive -- even Hux has gone! As he hurries off, WE HEAR: GENERAL HUX (V.O.) Supreme Leader. INT. STARKILLER BASE - ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT Hux stands before SNOKE'S IMAGE. Relative quiet here, but distant SOUNDS OF DESTRUCTION. Hux tries to keep it together but is horrified, heartsick: GENERAL HUX The fuel cells have ruptured. The collapse of the planet has begun. Snoke takes this in. Furious, desolate... knowing. SNOKE Leave the base at once and come to me with Kylo Ren. (grim) It is time to complete his training. EXT. FOREST - NIGHT Rey turns, runs a hundred feet through the forest to: FINN, who lies, near death, not far from where the GROUND FELL AWAY. Rey falls to her knees near him, turns him over, sees his cauterized but possibly fatal wound. REY Finn! Finn... Tears come to her eyes as she lifts him, holds his lifeless body in her arms. Snow flurries around them as she cries, holding this boy who she just met, who she already adores. They are left here to die -- nearby MORE TREES DROP as the planet continues to COLLAPSE. And just as it seems like all is lost... Her wet eyes look up to see: LIGHTS RISE FROM THE NEWLY-FORMED CANYON -- IT'S A SHIP WE KNOW -- IT'S THE MILLENNIUM FALCON -- and its lights ILLUMINATE REY, WHOSE FACE FILLS WITH HOPE! CHEWIE IS AT THE CONTROLS. He ROARS to them! EXT. FALCON - NIGHT Chewie exits the ship. MOMENTS LATER Chewie CARRIES FINN up the ramp. Rey hurries with them back into the ship -- INT. FALCON - NIGHT Chewie carries Finn inside, followed by Rey. EXT. SPACE - NIGHT And we FLY WITH THE FALCON as it leaves the planet -- we can see CHEWIE AND REY PILOTING, the COLLAPSING PLANET BEHIND US. The Resistance X-wings, led by Poe, follow the Falcon. INT. X-WING - NIGHT POE All teams! I got eyes on them! SNAP Yes! The X-wings ROAR OFF, skyward as the MUSIC SOARS, the PLANET IMPLODES -- THE SUNLIGHT IT CONTAINS BURSTS FORTH, and as we get further and further distance from what was Starkiller Base, we witness the REBIRTH OF A SUN. Light restored to a corner of the galaxy. The Millennium Falcon and the X-wings RIP THROUGH SPACE, headed home. POE Our job's done here. Let's go home! EXT. D'QAR - DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT as the Falcon on the landing strip. EXT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY The Falcon has landed among the remaining Resistance ships. Poe is there, watching as Chewie scuttles down the ramp carrying an unconscious Finn. Medical Personnel and Officers, meet them, usher them inside. MEDIC Easy, easy. He's hurt. We've got a heartbeat. Rey walks down the ramp and sees, for the first time, Leia. C-3PO and BB-8 behind her. The crowds are cheering. Rey is so sad for Leia, so sorry. The two women move for each other. And Leia takes Rey's face in her hands. Despite her heartbreak, she is grateful. She embraces Rey. A mother's embrace. Rey cries, too, in this emotional first meeting. INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY Chewbacca sits quietly, as do many in the base, mourning their losses. As BB-8 approaches R2-D2, the long dormant droid suddenly stirs. The droids beep at each other. C-3PO R2-D2! You've come back! You found what? How dare you call me that! (MORE) (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: C-3PO (CONT'D) (he swats R2-D2, who continues beeping) Find Master Luke how? Come, R2! We must go tell the others at once! INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY Leia stands alone and in silence, heartbroken. C-3PO (O.S.) General? Excuse me, General? Leia turns to see droids. C-3PO (CONT'D) R2-D2 may contain some much needed good news. LEIA Tell me. Rey stands with Leia, Poe C-3PO, BB-8 and a handful of Resistance Officers. Suddenly R2-D2 PROJECTS A HOLOGRAM! A LARGE NAVIGATIONAL MAP WITH A SPECIFIC MISSING CHUNK! BB-8 BEEPS -- Poe turns to him -- POE Yeah, all right, buddy, hold on -- Poe runs over -- removes the ancient data device that Lor San Tekka had given him from a base computer. He inserts it back inside BB-8, who then PROJECTS HIS MAP -- which he SHRINKS DOWN TO SIZE -- and the two droids MOVE SLIGHTLY -- TOGETHER -- THE TWO HOLOGRAMS UNITE, BB-8'S PIECE FILLING IN R2-D2'S PERFECTLY! Everyone REACTS -- amazed -- C-3PO Oh! The map! It is complete! LEIA (hand on her heart) -- Luke -- Suddenly there are CHEERS AND EMBRACES. C-3PO leans down to R2-D2 and says, quietly, sweetly: C-3PO (to R2-D2) Oh my dear friend. How I've missed you. INT. RESISTANCE BASE - I.C.U. - DAY A NEW DAY. Finn, unconscious in an I.C.U. POD. His fate uncertain. Rey sits with him. Deeply worried. Finally she leans in, close to him. She kisses him and says, quietly, despite her fear: REY We'll see each other again. I believe that. Thank you, my friend. EXT. D'QAR - DAY Chewie does last minute checks of the Falcon. Rey stands with Leia a beat and then turns to head to the Falcon. As Rey walks off, she hears Leia call out: LEIA Rey. Rey turns around. LEIA (CONT'D) May the Force be with you. This fills Rey up. She smiles gratefully. Rey crosses to the Falcon. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY Rey sits in the pilot seat, Chewie as co-pilot. Rey looks at him compassionately. Rey FLICKS SWITCHES and -- EXT. D'QAR - DAY The Millennium Falcon RISES. Leia, with Poe, BB-8, and C-3PO (with his proper arm replaced), watches the next generation of Jedi begin her journey. EXT. SPACE - DAY The Falcon FLIES through space and BLASTS to LIGHTSPEED. EXT. AHCH-TO - DAY A pristine and mighty OCEAN. Endless BLUE, dotted with random, beautiful, mountainous BLACK ROCK ISLANDS, dotted with countless GREEN TREES. The Millennium Falcon FLIES INTO VIEW, BANKS toward one of the ISLANDS. EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - DAY Rey, her staff strapped to her back, begins her hike up the considerable mountain, glancing back at Chewie and R2-D2, who watch her from the bottom of the ramp. A deep breath and Rey continues her journey. EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - STONE STAIRS - DAY Built within the rock and foliage of this idyllic island are seemingly endless ANCIENT STONE STEPS. Rey continues to climb them, determined, despite her fatigue. EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - STONE STRUCTURES - DAY Rey arrives at a clearing. Small, modest, primitive stone structures. But no one around. Rey walks past them, sees, senses no one. And then she stops. Feels something. She turns. Standing forty feet away from her, his back to us, is a MAN, in a CLOAK AND ROBE. Rey stares, knowing exactly who it is. But she just stares for what seems like forever. Until he finally TURNS, SLOWLY, to her. Pulls back his hood. IT IS LUKE SKYWALKER. Older now, white hair, bearded. He looks at Rey. A kindness in his eyes, but there's something tortured, too. He doesn't need to ask her who she is, or what she is doing here. His look says it all. In response, Rey pulls something from the pack. LUKE'S LIGHTSABER. And she holds it out to him. An offer. A plea. The galaxy's only hope. HOLD ON LUKE SKYWALKER'S INCREDIBLE FACE, amazed and conflicted at what he sees, as our MUSIC BUILDS, the promise of an adventure, just beginning... THE END"
THE STAR WARS
BY
GEORGE LUCAS
FIRST DRAFT LUCASFILM
JULY 1974 LIMITED
FADE IN:
1. SPACE
A sea of stars is broken by the vast blue surface of
"the planet, OGANA. Five small moons slowly drift into"
view from the far side of the planet. The main
titles are followed by a roll-up:
"Until the recent GREAT REBELLION,"
the DAI NOGAS were the most feared
warriors in the universe. For one
"hundred thousand years, generations"
of DAI perfected their art as the
personal bodyguards of the King.
They were the chief architects of
"the invincible ROYAL SPACE FORCE,"
which expanded the King's power
"across the galaxy, from the celes-"
tial equator to the farthest stars.
Now these legendary warriors are all
"but extinct. One by one, they have"
been hunted down and destroyed as
enemies of the NEW GALACTIC KINGDOM
by a ferocious and sinister rival
"warrior sect, THE LEGIONS OF LETTOW."
A small silver spacecraft emerges from behind one of
the Ogana moons. The deadly little fightercraft
"speeds past several of the moons, until it finally"
goes into orbit around the FOURTH MOON.
2. VALLEY OF COLORED LAKES- FOURTH MOON - OGANA
A harsh gale blows across the bleak grey surface of
the Fourth Moon. The blood red sky presses down on a
"lone figure, JUSTIN VALOR, a tall, heavy-set boy of"
sixteen. He slowly makes his way across a wierd
plain covered with huge sprawling lakes. The water in
"some of the lakes is bright red, while in others it is"
a vivid green. The oddly colored lakes create an
ominous landscape against the eerie red sky.
The heavy winds whip at the young boy and make the
going extremely difficult. His face is covered by a
breath mask and goggles. He stops for a second to
adjust the shoulder strap on his chrome multiplelazer
"rifle. Something in the sky catches his eye, and he"
instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from
"his belt. He stands transfixed for a few moments,"
"studying the heavens, then turns and rushes back in"
the direction from which he came.
3. SUPPLY HUT - FOURTH MOON - OGANA
"A damaged spacecraft, half buried in the dust, rests"
next to the remains of an abandoned supply shack. Justin
makes his way across the colorless landscape and
rushes into the crumbling building. The interior of
"the hut is shabby, but manages to abate the howling"
winds. Seated in front of a thermoheater are Justin's
"father, AKIRA, and his young brother, BINK. Akira is"
"a large, burly man, wearing the distinctive robes of a"
"Dai. Bink is ten years old, with dusty blond hair and"
a large scratch on his cheek. Justin slams the door
and removes his gear. His ruggedly handsome face is
caked with many layers of dust.
JUSTIN
Dad! Dad! They've found us!
Bink looks up from a small cube he has been studying.
His father whacks him across the shoulder with a
braided wire connector.
AKIRA
Continue with the problem. Your
concentration is worse than your
brother's. (to Justin) How many?
JUSTIN
Only one this time. A Cao Four.
AKIRA
Good. We may not have to repair
this old bucket after all. Pre-
pare yourself.
BINK
Me too!
AKIRA
Do you have the answer?
BINK
I think it's the Corbet dictum:
"""What is, is without."""
Akira smiles. This is the correct answer. Justin is
strapping on a utility belt with chrome lazerpistols
and lazersword. Akira rises and starts for his equip-
ment.
BINK (Cont.)
"Ahhh, Pop..."
AKIRA
"Bink, do you feel you're ready?"
BINK
"Yes, sir. I've outmarked Justin in"
twelve disciplines. I'm as good...
AKIRA
"All right, son. Get your gear."
Bink jumps up with the enthusiasm available only to
a ten-year old and grabs his gear. His father frowns
and shakes his head.
4. WASTELAND BLUFF - FOURTH MOON - OGANA
Akira Valor and his two sons carefully make their way
up a rock bluff overlooking the Lettow spacecraft parked
among the colored lakes.Akira inspects the
with his electrobinoculars.
AKIRA
No tracks. Bi-lock hasn't been opened.
Interior systems are still on.
JUSTIN
Are we going to wait for him to come
out?
AKIRA
He's not in there. He's baiting us.
I'm surprised they only sent one this
"time. We must be wearing them down,"
or they must think this warrior is
"something special. Stay on guard,"
and keep hidden. I'm going to work
my way across the ridge and call his
bluff. Better we meet in open combat
than wait for him to ambush us. Keep
your guard!
Akira leaves his two sons and moves off along the
obscured ridge. Justin and Bink watch him intently.
Justin throws down his multiplelazer rifle in dis-
gust.
JUSTIN
He should have let me go with him.
He's getting too old to make an open
challenge.
BINK
He's not too old to realize you'd
just get in the way.
Justin ignores his little brother's remark and sneaks
a look over the ridge at the Lettow spacecraft. Akira
moves out of the rocks some distance away and starts
toward the starship. Bink moves to the ridge next to
"his brother, his chrome lazerrifle sparkling in the"
reflected red light of Ogana.
BINK
He's making his move.
JUSTIN
Watch your guard... and cover
that weapon. It shines like a
beacon.
Bink reluctantly move away and watches the other
direction. Akira has almost reached the Lettow
spacecraft and still there is no sign of its
occupant.
BINK
What's happening?
JUSTIN
Nothing. I don't like it.
Akira carefully moves to the main hatch of the star-
ship. He kicks a valve and the hatch drops open
with a loud clank and rushing gas. Justin becomes
more tense as his father carefully moves inside the
spacecraft. Everything is still. Even the continual
winds seem to have died down. Moments pass with no
sign of activity inside the enemy starship. Justin
watches the craft with his electrobinoculars. The
waiting becomes unbearable.
JUSTIN
Something's happened! He's been in
there too long.
BINK
Let me look! Stand my guard.
Bink takes the electrobinoculars from his brother and
studies the silent spacecraft. Justin impatiently
scans the distant red horizon.
BINK
I think the power just went off.
We'd better wait here until some-
one comes out.
JUSTIN
What if he needs help?
BINK
The power went back on again....
"With the aid of the electrobinoculars, Bink watches"
the running lights of the starship flash on and off.
Suddenly something huge moves in front of his field
of vision. Before either of the two young boys can
"react, a large, sinister Lettow warrior in black"
robes and a face mask looms over them. He carries
a long lazersword which cuts young Bink down before
he or his brother is able to raise his weapon. The
"startled Justin backs away in horror, then settles"
down and ignites his lazersword which creates an
eerie red glow. He stumbles over rocks as he attempts
to avoid the charging Lettow warrior. The evil
"warrior swings his mighty lazersword, but Justin"
manages to deflect the intended deathblow.
"Finally, Justin is able to assume a defensive stance,"
"and the two warriors stand, sizing up each other. The"
"legionnaire is at least seven feet tall, and dwarfs"
"the young Dai. They stand for a few moments, almost"
"frozen, then in a flurry of blows, lazerswords clash"
with the sound of electric snapping and popping.
Justin is barely able to hold his own against the
experienced warrior. Many blows are exchanged before
the Lettow warrior is able to back Justin up against
a deep crevasse. Justin stumbles and almost falls
over the cliff to his death.
The legionnaire suddenly senses something behind him
"and whirls around to face Justin's father, Akira Valor,"
a Dai Nogas master. The Lettow warrior raises his
"lazersword, but is cut in two before he can bring it"
down again. Akira moves to the fallen legionnaire
"and studies him carefully. Justin, still a little"
"wobbly from the whole experience, attempts to stand."
Akira sees his dead son Bink and goes to him. He
lifts him into his arms and begins to weep. Justin
"stands bewildered, watching his father cradle the"
dead child.
5. INTERIOR LETTOW STARSHIP - VALLEY OF COLORED LAKES -
OGANA
Akira Valor slides into one of the four seats of the
small Lettow starship. Through the front viewing
"canopy, he watches Justin drag Bink's body to a small"
crevasse. Justin places a small locket around his
"brother's neck, makes a complicated sign, and dumps"
the body into the shallow depression. The giant
"engines of the spacecraft begin to whine, kicking up"
large clouds of dust.
Justin climbs into the seat beside his father and
removes his breath mask and goggles. There are
tears in his eyes. Father and son look out across
the wasteland towards Bink's grave. The thunderous
clap of an explosion is followed by a small mushroom
cloud rising out of the depression. Justin throws a
container down in a fit of rage.
JUSTIN
How many more of them are there? I
"want to finish it, once and for all."
I'm sick of running. When will it
stop?
Justin's father waits silently until the tirade is
finished. Justin sits silently for a few moments.
JUSTIN (Cont.)
I'm sorry.
AKIRA
"Son, plot a course for TOWNOWI."
Justin lights up like a Geenick at feeding time.
JUSTIN
Townowi! You mean we're going home?
AKIRA
We both need a rest.
Akira pulls back on the throttle and the powerful
spaceship lifts off the surface of the Fourth Moon
of Ogana.
6. CLOUD SEA - GRANICUS
A title card appears over a sea of billowing clouds
on the gaseous planet of GRANICUS:
Granicus: Capital of the New
Galactic Empire.
"The towering yellow oxide clouds pass, revealing the"
Royal City of Granicus. The magnificent domed and
"gleaming city is perched, mushroom-like, on a tall"
spire which disappears deep into the misty surface
of the planet. The peacefulness of this nebulous
idyll is broken by the increasing wail of ion
engines. Four sleek stardestroyers from the Royal
Fleet burst out of the huge cumulus range. The
craft are flying in a tight formation as they bank
"steeply, and head toward the royal capital of the"
New Galactic Kingdom.
7. INTERIOR STARDESTROYER - GRANICUS
Stardestroyers are two-man spacecraft crammed with
sophisticated electronic weaponry. The pilot and
gunnery officers sit side-by-side surrounded by
lighted readouts and switches. They wear the gleaming
black uniforms of the King's elite corps.
PILOT
Tok-One to Chicks: Shape it up.
Let's make it good.
CHICK-ONE
Does that glare bother you?
PILOT
"Use your face shield, Chick-One."
The pilot is cold and professional as he maneuvers
his craft closer to the others. The positions of
"the ships are displayed on a read-out, along with a"
graphic representation of the city. The pilot gives
the gunner a quick look before he flips his sunshield
over his eyes.
PILOT
"Here we go. Count: three, two,"
"one, now!"
8. REVIEW STAND - PLAZA OF THE DONNS - GRANICUS
"On a huge austere platform stands the dark SON HHAT,"
"Lord of Granicus, Consul to the Supreme Tribunal, and"
ruler of the Galactic Kingdom. He is a thin gray
looking man with an evil mustache hanging limply
over his insidious lip. Standing at rigid attention
on his right are several generals dressed in the
black and grey uniform of the realm. Five members
of the Supreme Tribunal sit off to the side. On
"Hhat's left stands MARA HORUS, newly appointed"
Governor of the Townowi Systems. He is a young
treacherous man with stone-cut angular features and
piercing gray eyes.
They all gaze skyward as the four gleaming star-
destroyers scream low overhead in an impressive
barrel-roll formation. As the sound of the space-
craft resonates throughout the glass canyon of the
"Plaza, the group of dignitaries return their atten-"
tion to the parade of royal shock troops and
"giant air tanks (which ride magically, two or three"
feet above the ground).
The Plaza of the Donns is filled with hundreds of rows
of troops as the last brigade marches into position.
The sound of three thousand men snapping to attention
is followed by a strange silence. A light wind blows
the great red banner of the kingdom creating a subtle
flapping sound. The king's amplified voice startles
many of the troops as it cuts through the quiet.
SON HHAT
Upon this battle depends the survival
of the Galactic Kingdom. Upon this
battle depends the life and long con-
tinuity of our civilization. Not
since the great Dai Rebellion has our
destiny been placed in such a balance.
This is to be the most magnificent
campaign of all! You have never been
called without doing something to be
"remembered, something notable and"
striking. The conquering of the
"Townowi System, the last of the inde-"
pendent systems and the last refuge
"of the outlawed, vile sect of the Dai,"
will have such important and lasting
"consequences, that I can't but consider"
it as an epoch in history.
"To the rear of the Plaza, watching the spectacle over"
"the shoulder of a curious bureaucrat, stands CLIEG OXUS,"
"a tall, blond young man about twenty years old. He seems"
"interested in what the King has to say, but keeps"
looking around nervously as if someone were after him.
"His arm rests across his head, as he carefully but coolly"
adjusts a glowing blue ring on his index finger. The
King nears the end of his speech. Mara Horus has moved
up to stand next to the sinister monarch. The troops
shout a royal salute in response to a particularly
partisan statement.
SON HHAT (Cont.)
... I have personally asked the Townowians
to accept this Treaty of Alliance. During
"the period of negotiation, they have only"
decided to be undecided. We will barter no
longer. Governor Horus has been appointed
the First Lord of the Townowi System and
Surrounding Territories. This is the last
frontier and the final stone in the great
wall of the Galactic Kingdom.
"The troops cheer, and the King escorts Horus inside."
"Oxus moves quickly away from the Plaza, passing through"
"several check stations, where he is forced to show his"
identification.
9. NIGHT CLUB - GRANICUS
Oxus walks into the glass and chrome splendor of one
of the famous nightclubs of Granicus. He moves to the
"long mirrored bar and sits next to a rough looking man,"
"BOMOJE ESPAA, dressed in the distinctive gold and furs"
of the galactic traders.
OXUS
Your glass is empty.
Oxus speaks into a small intercom on the bar front.
OXUS (Cont.)
A dantic and...
He looks in Espaa's glass.
ESPAA
"No thanks, Clieg. I've had enough."
OXUS
"Just a dantic, then. Espaa, it's"
not like you to refuse a drink.
You're going to give the galactic
traders a bad name.
A drink appears magically from a small elevator in the
"bar. Oxus takes it, and then places a pen-like trans-"
mitter he has taken from his pocket next to the inter-
com. It creates a low electronic buzz.
10. BAR OBSERVATION CENTER - GRANICUS
A controller sitting in front of a row of monitors taps
"his headphones, then flips a switch back and forth a"
couple of times. He is obviously annoyed.
CONTROLLER
Number eighteen is out again. Give
me a maintenance check.
The controller yawns and puts his feet up on the control
panel.
11. NIGHTCLUB - GRANICUS
Espaa leans in close to Oxus. He is suddenly very serious.
ESPAA
"Clieg, we've got problems. They've"
"just grounded all spacecraft, in-"
cluding trade frigates. Even the
ships under royal registry can't
move. Something big is up.
OXUS
I'm afraid they're not waiting for
the Alliance Treaty. They're
already moving against the System.
I've got to get word back.
ESPAA
The chrome companies are protesting
"the embargo, but it's going to take"
some time.
OXUS
Isn't anything moving?
ESPAA
"Military ships, but..."
They are interrupted by a royal officer and several
storm troopers. The officer shouts over the P.A.
system as the troops rush to block the exits. Oxus
"and the galactic trader are tense, but remain cool."
OFFICER
Attention: All captains and first
officers of Guild Trade frigates
will accompany me to the Ministry
of Transport immediately.
Espaa gives Oxus a hopeless look as the troops check
"their papers, and then take Espaa away. A small fight"
breaks out in the back of the nightclub as one of the
trader captains expresses his dislike of the kingdom.
Oxus slams his glass to the bar in a gesture of hate
and frustration.
12. GOVERNOR HORUS? QUARTERS - GRANICUS
The large white-on-white executive quarters resound
with the high-pitched laugh of the evil Governor
"Horus. He slaps DARTH VADER, a tall, grim looking"
"general, on the back and the general's mouth makes"
the slightest gesture at a smile.
HORUS
Success! I told you. We are no
longer under the control of the
GREAT FAMILIES. We've gained a
true advantage.
"VANTOS COLL, a member of the Supreme Tribunal, and a"
"man of the grossest dimensions, appears to be a little"
worried.
COLL
A rather dangerous advantage.
You still have a system to
conquer.
HORUS
But this system will bring us
more scientific wealth than that
of any other house in the
tribunal. We will easily gain
control of the directorship.
COLL
Don't underestimate the armies of
Townowi. They're lead by a Dai
warrior.
HORUS
I've told you about Commissioner
"Coll, General. He worries a lot."
VADER
It's a myth that any Dai still exists.
COLL
General Skywalker is no myth. When
"I first arrived at court, he was"
the first bodyguard to the King.
He lead the Dai Rebellion.
VADER
NGAI THUC lead the Rebellion.
COLL
"So the King would have you beieve,"
but I was there.
VADER
Then why wasn't he hunted down like
the others?
COLL
"Because he is too dangerous, too"
"clever. Besides, his presence on"
Townowi is still only a rumor.
HORUS
Then why do you believe it?
COLL
Because I knew him. He's there
all right. I can sense it. Mark
"my words, Townowi will not be"
easily conquered.
13. COURTYARD - PALACE OF LITE - TOWNOWI
"A low, sleek landspeeder (an auto-like transport which"
travels a few feet above the ground on a magnetic field)
glides into the courtyard of the palace of Townowi.
"The planet, with its bright green sky, is a desert"
"wilderness; but the palace is a sparkling oasis, with"
low concrete walls and great turrets spilling over with
foliage from rooftop gardens. The speeder stops before
an enormous shaded corridor. Fountains line the
beautiful and highly polished tile walkway. Two
"young boys, OETA (7) and PUCK (5) are helped out of the"
"speeder by AMBER, a one-armed bodyguard dressed in the"
flowing white robes of the Townowi military. The two
"boys run through the long corridors, yelling and"
"screaming, their little footsteps echoing throughout"
the palace.
14. LIBRARY - PALACE OF LITE - TOWNOWI
"The palace library is a dim, cool room, projecting an"
aura of time-worn comfort and security. In the
"distance, the children can be heard screaming through"
"the corridors. KING KAYOS, silver haired but amazingly"
"youthful under a tanned and leathery face, motions for"
one of his aides to shut the partially closed door.
He is in the middle of an emergency meeting of the
Townowi High Senate. The twelve men sit in overstuffed
"chairs, placed in a large circle. A large, sallow-eyed"
"galactic trader named AAY ZAVOS, fiddlesnervously with"
a small scrap of leather as he speaks.
ZAVOS
"My Lord, the chrome companies are with"
"you in spirit, but you must understand,"
they can't openly support you. Royal
trade restrictions are very unfavorable
"and we, of course, favor your indepen-"
dence.
KAYOS
"If there were to be war, would your"
frigates still supply us?
ZAVOS
Your bluntness is to be commended.
It could be arranged.
"COUNT SANDAGE, a corrupt noble of the senate, jumps to"
his feet in a rage.
SANDAGE
This is nonsense! We have no choice
but to approve the treaty. If there
"is war, the New Galactic Kingdom will"
destroy our entire system with a snap
of the finger. General Skywalker is
a dreamer if he thinks he can mount
"any meaningful resistance, and you're"
dreamers if you believe him. So much
trust in one aged man. You must see...
"At that moment, all heads turn as someone enters the"
"room. It is General Luke Skywalker, Commander of the"
"Townowi Star Force. He is a large man, apparently in"
"his early forties, but actually much older. Every-"
one senses the aura of power that radiates from this
great warrior. Here is a leader: a Dai general. He
"looks weary, but is still a magnificent looking warrior."
"His face, cracked and weathered by exotic climates, is"
"set off by a close silver beard, and dark, penetrating"
eyes. Sandage is somewhat embarrassed and quietly sits
down.
SKYWALKER
Is there anyone here so naive he
believes the Galactic Kingdom
would even bother negotiating if
they were contemplating destruction
"of this system? Your Excellencies,"
this is more than a simple raid on
your resources. You must reach a
decision.
"MIR NASH, a thin, birdlike senator, turns to General"
Skywalker.
NASH
"General Skywalker, war is a serious"
business... a deadly business.
SKYWALKER
"Procrastination is a deadly business,"
Senator. War is my business. Have
you approved my defense measures?
The GRANDE MOUFF TARKIN wears the long black robes of
"the Townowian religion. He speaks with a high,"
cracking voice.
TARKIN
An actual war with the Galactic Kingdom
is still only a remote possibility. As
"a military treatise, your proposal has"
"certain merits, but in the harsh light"
"of reality, an attack against the Galac-"
tic Kingdom appears to be a somewhat
extreme defense.
NASH
"You must understand, General, we?re"
"interested in avoiding a war, not"
starting one.
SKYWALKER
There are times when offense makes
the best defense. If that Alliance
"Treaty isn't signed, we will need"
all the advantage we can get.
KAYOS
"Count Sandage, I want you to head"
the delegation to Granicus. You
will leave tomorrow with our answer
regarding the treaty. My decision
will be forthcoming.
The senators whisper among themselves.
KAYOS (Cont.)
"All right, then. May the force"
of others be with you all.
The senators leave in a flurry of hushed conversation.
"The general is lost in thought, and remains in his chair."
"Oeta and Puck, King Kayo's two young sons, storm through"
"the existing senators, and rush on to Kayos' lap. The"
King is obviously very proud of the two young princes.
"He throws Oeta into the air, and then catches him again."
PUCK
Me too! Me too!
OETA
Zara's leaving! Zara's leaving and
you gotta say good-bye.
"The King picks up Puck and swings him around, then puts"
him down.
KAYOS
"Okay, whippersnapper, go tell your"
mother and your sister that I'm on
my way.
The two boys run out of the room and are heard yelling
"and screaming down the hallway. The king starts out, but"
stops in front of the general.
KAYOS
"Luke, my daughter is leaving for the"
academy at Chathos. Won't you come
and wish her well? It would mean a
"lot to her. She truly idolizes you,"
"you know. Come on, the war will"
wait.
SKYWALKER
"Of course. I'm sorry, My Lord."
Politics always seem to distress me.
"General Skywalker rises, and as they head for the door,"
Kayos pats him on the back.
KAYOS
"I know, Luke. I feel THE FORCE also."
15. COURTYARD - PALACE OF LITE - TWONOWI
"A large, four-seat speeder sits gleaming in the sun-"
"soaked courtyard. The PRINCESS ZARA, about fourteen"
"years old, possessing a soft beauty and iron will, is"
"embracing her mother, QUEEN BREHA, a warm, silver-"
haired matron. There are tears in the princess' blue
"eyes. Oeta and Puck jump around inside the speeder,"
disrupting the efforts of the one-armed Amber to pack
several plaxiform cases.
Zara embraces the King as he approaches with the
general.
ZARA
"Oh, Daddy, I'll miss you so."
KAYOS
The semester will be over before you
know it. You'll have a grand time.
There are so many new things to learn.
I wish I were going.
"He gives her a fatherly smile, and she hugs him again."
The general stands rather formally to one side. The
"princess, her long auburn hair tied in braids, moves"
to the general and he bows before her.
SKYWALKER
May your studies do you honor.
Zara is somewhat embarrassed by the general's formality
and can only manage an awkward smile before returning
to her parents at the speeder.
BREHA
"Hurry, Zara. You must make it to"
Yuell before nightfall.
"The princess' maids-in-waiting, ALANA, a short stocky"
"girl, and MINA, more comely (somewhat that same stature"
"as Zara) with long dark hair, giggle and straighten"
Zara's dress before she enters the speeder. The prin-
"cess and Mina hug Alana, whose giggles have turned to"
tears. The two boys scramble out of the speeder as
Amber helps the princess and her maid into the back
seat. The speeder is piloted by a trooper of the
"first order. Amber jumps into the seat beside him,"
and the speeder starts with a low buzzing sound. The
"princess waves to her family, and Mina waves to Alana"
as the speeder slowly glides out of the courtyard.
16. WAR ROOM - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - TOWNOWI
"The huge war room is a mass of glass enclosures,"
"electronic wall displays, monitors, and computer"
"stations. General Skywalker enters a control station,"
followed by a covey of military aides of various ranks.
"As the group hurry through the crowded room, men rise"
and salute the new arrivals. The general stops before
a giant display of the galaxy. Small symbols flash on
and off over various portions of the big board. The
general studies it intently.
SKYWALKER
Montross!
"CAPTAIN MONTROSS, one of the general's aides, snaps to"
attention.
MONTROSS
Sir!
SKYWALKER
What's the TQ on this?
MONTROSS
The last frigate to leave Granicus
"was at twenty-three forty, Sir."
SKYWALKER
Have any ships at all left the
planet? (to another aide) Check
with the Guild on NORTON THREE.
MONTROSS
"At twenty-four hundred, a full"
battalion of stardestroyers left
for what is projected to be
"ANCHORHEAD, or a nearby system."
SKYWALKER
And no word from Oxus. He should
have reported by now. CAPTAIN PRUE!
"An older, academic looking aide, steps forward."
PRUE
Sir!
SKYWALKER
What do you make of this?
PRUE
"A battalion is invasion force, but the"
Royal Galactic Kingdom controls that
"entire part of the galaxy. A revolution,"
"maybe? At any rate, they're going in the"
wrong direction to be any trouble for us.
"The general ponders this for a few moments, then speaks"
almost to himself.
SKYWALKER
I don't know. It doesn't feel good.
MONTROSS
Put 'em on alert.
A loud uproar is heard on the far side of the war room.
Everyone turns to see a foreign dressed warrior pushing
his way past several guards and war-room bureaucrats.
"The warrior, with his long hair tied in an odd bun on"
"the top of his head, is Akira Valor. He is followed by"
"his son, Justin, who rudely pushes the pesky bureaucrats"
out of the way.
BUREAUCRATS
It's restricted. You'll have to
wait. (etc.)
AKIRA
"Get out of my way, boy, before I"
grind you into the surface. (etc.)
"As the dauntless Akira approaches the general, the guards"
stop in bewilderment as General Skywalker rushes up to
the warrior and embraces him. The two Dai warriors
"laugh jubilantly and slap one another, as the aides and"
bureaucrats look on in amazement.
SKYWALKER
Akira Valor - you old muscle-rat!
What a sight! We heard that you
had been executed.
AKIRA
So the Galactic Kingdom would have
you believe. I've been in the
KESSIL System. You remember little
Justin.
"Akira puts his arms around his son, who has been making"
eyes at one of the cute young female aides. He bows
before the general.
SKYWALKER
He takes after his mother! (they laugh)
It's so good to see you.
AKIRA
It's wonderful to be with another
Dai again. There are so few of us
left.
"The cute aide goes back to her duties, flirting with"
Justin as she passes. The young warrior pinches her
"on the ass, which startles her, but she goes on like"
nothing has happened.
SKYWALKER
What a sight!
"The two Dai stand looking at one another, hardly believing"
"the other is real. Finally, the general realizes his"
"aides are standing around, gawking at the duo."
SKYWALKER (to the aides)
"Wake up, gentlemen. You're on alert."
Keep me posted on that battalion.
17. CONTROL STATION - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - TOWNOWI
"The general, Akira and Justin enter a small glass enclosed"
"control office. They sit, and an awkward silence ensues"
as each man waits for the other to speak.
AKIRA
I've come for your help.
SKYWALKER
Anything you ask. You're a Dai
brother. We're one.
AKIRA
"My friend, we've been through much"
together. I've been through much
since we parted. I've lost much.
The Legions of Lettow have chased
us half way across the galaxy. There
is no refuge. One day they will come
here. Take my son as your JUWO
learner. He would be a Dai. I've
trained him from birth. He's reached
the fifth stage. He fought in the
Kessilian civil wars and commanded a
Hubble expedition to the CONE Systems.
"He's a good boy, Luke, and one hell"
of a fighter.
"The general looks down, somewhat embarrassed. He scratches"
"his head, then smiles."
SKYWALKER
"Old friend, you do me too much honor."
I was never a match for you. Why don't
you finish his training yourself?
AKIRA
"I'm too old, Luke. I can't go on."
You must finish it.
SKYWALKER
What kind of talk is this? You're
not the old Valor I remember. Too
old?!?
Akira Valor suddenly ignites in a rage and swings
his left forearm down with a mighty blow across the
solid chrome desk the general is sitting at. The
"old Dai warrior's forearm cracks in two, spewing forth"
wires and many fine multicolored electronic components.
The artificial limb flops lifelessly to Valor's side.
"The warrior rips open his tunic, revealing a plastic"
chest stuffed with flashing electronic parts.
AKIRA (angrily)
I'm not the same. There is nothing
left but my head and right arm. I've
"lost too much, Luke. I'm dying."
The general bows his head in sorrow for one of the
greatest warriors in the galaxy and a dear friend.
SKYWALKER
I'm sorry...
AKIRA
I'm sorry. I keep losing control.
I'm very tired. Take my son! The DAI
NOGAS must survive. We must pass it
on. Only a Dai can stop Son Hhat.
"We're very old, Luke. A new"
generation of Dai must be started.
Take him; teach him the way of
the Dai Nogas.
Captain Montross bursts into the office and somewhat
excitedly salutes the general.
MONTROSS
"Sir, we have picked up something!"
"An asteroid, or solid comet moving"
away from the Anchorhead System.
18. WAR ROOM - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - TOWNOWI
The general rushes out of the control station and back
to the giant galactic display. He is followed by
"Montross, Akira and Justin."
SKYWALKER
Are you sure it's not the battalion?
MONTROSS
A solid object. It's as big as our
Third Moon.
PRUE
"It's too large to be man-made, and it's"
too slow to be a comet.
SKYWALKER
Analysis?
MONTROSS
It's too far out.
SKYWALKER
I'll be with the king. Report as soon
as you can get a reading on it. (turning
"to Akira's son) Captain Valor, from now"
on you stick close to me.
"The older Valor smiles, and puts his good arm around"
his old friend.
19. DINING CHAMBER - PALACE OF LITE - TOWNOWI
King Kayos moves his arm around Breha's waist as they
stand on a balcony watching two giant twin suns in the
green sky disappear behind a distant dune range. The
"general enters, rather in a rush, followed by the"
"young Valor, who is now dressed in the white uniform of"
the Townowi star force. (He still wears the distinctive
Kessilian hair knot.) They bow before the King.
KAYOS (pointing to the suns)
"Aren't they beautiful, General?"
"""Always and never the same."""
You're just in time for dinner.
SKYWALKER
I have come for other reasons.
Could...?
KAYOS
"Relax, General. We will discuss it,"
"but over dinner. There are times,"
"Luke, when I find you a bit too rigid."
Is this your new disciple?
Justin is ill at ease and bows again.
JUSTIN
"Justin Valor, sir."
KAYOS
Where's your father?
SKYWALKER
He left for the spaceport at GORDON
"to visit an old friend, Han Solo,"
the UREALLIAN.
KAYOS
We are becoming quite a refuge.
The group sit at a large table and food is brought in by
servants. They eat. Justin is nervous and watches the
"general, to make sure he is being proper."
SKYWALKER
"My Lord, several events have occurred"
which lead me to believe we are in
imminent danger of attack. There is
no longer time for discussion and debate.
KAYOS
What events?
SKYWALKER
"Oxus, our best agent, has disappeared"
in the galactic capital. There is
unusual military traffic in the S-4
sectors.
KAYOS
"Unless you have direct, concrete proof"
"of a pending attack, there is nothing"
I can do.
SKYWALKER
"By the time we have proof, it may be"
too late.
KAYOS
"Luke, I'm leaving tonight for AMSEL."
I'm meeting with the full assembly
first thing in the morning. I am not
"going to approve the Alliance Treaty,"
and I will get your defense measure
approved. Just be patient. You will
have the war code.
SKYWALKER
"Tomorrow may be too late. My Lord,"
I need the war code now. We must
get our forces into space.
KAYOS
"But it must be done legally, with"
everyone's approval. Tomorrow you
will have that. I doubt the New
Galactic Kingdom would attack before
receiving our answer. The separation
of war powers is the one condition
upon which you assumed command of our
"forces. You're a friend, Luke, and"
I trust you; but you're also an out-
lander who controls a great deal of
power. I can't forsake my oath any
more than you can. Just be patient.
You will have the code tomorrow.
Captain Montross enters the large chamber and bows before
the King.
MONTROSS
"I bring a report to General Skywalker,"
My Lord.
KAYOS
You may deliver it.
MONTROSS
"Sir, the asteroid has disappeared from"
our scopes. There is no trace of it.
SKYWALKER
Were they able to analyze it?
MONTROSS
"It never came within range, sir."
"The general rises, quickly followed by Captain Valor."
GENERAL
"Excuse us, My Lord. We'd better"
get back. I will wait patiently
for the approval.
The general and Montross exit the chamber. Valor takes
"one last bite of his dinner, then dashes after his mentor."
20. WAR ROOM - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - TOWNOWI
The general sits rigidly facing the big galactic display
"board. Several aides and bureaucrats rush to and fro,"
ignoring the general. He is asleep. Captain Prue
approaches the general and snaps to attention. The
general's eyes open.
SKYWALKER
What are the results?
PRUE
"Negative, Sir."
SKYWALKER
Are you sure?
PRUE
Absolutely.
SKYWALKER
It's just not possible. Something
that size can't just disappear with-
out a trace. Check it again.
PRUE
"That's the tenth negative, Sir."
SKYWALKER
I said check it again.
Captain Prue retreats to a computer station. The general
looks around for Captain Valor.
SKYWALKER
Valor!
"Everyone near the general turns, but Valor doesn't show."
SKYWALKER
Where is that boy? Montross!
Montross rushes up to the general and snaps to attention.
SKYWALKER
Page Captain Valor.
"Montross goes back to his station and a few moments later,"
Captain Valor is paged over the P.A. system. The general
"waits, watching the big board. Eventually, Justin stumbles"
"out of an enclosed computer closet, fastening his pants and"
"tucking in his tunic. A moment later, the cute female aide"
rather sheepishly exits the computer closet. She also is
in the process of putting her uniform back together. Justin
rushes up to the general and snaps to attention.
"The general lets him stand there for a moment, not acknow-"
"ledging his presence; then, suddenly without warning and"
"in one masterful flash motion, the general stands, grabs"
a small baton attached to his belt (which immediately
ignites into a four-foot glowing lazersword) and swings
"at the young warrior's head. In an equally quick movement,"
Justin ignites his lazersword and blocks the general's
blow. Everyone in the war room is surprised and startled.
"After a moment, they rush to the general. Justin and the"
"general stand motionless for a few moments, with lazer-"
"swords locked in mid-air. Finally, the general grins and Justin"
hesitantly relaxes. They lower their swords and turn them off.
SKYWALKER
"You are trained well, but remember,"
"a Dai must be single-minded, a"
discipline your father obviously
"never learned, hence your existence."
Clean yourself up. Discipline is
essential. Your mind must follow
the way of the Nogas.
JUSTIN
"It won't happen again, sir. There"
are many new....
P.A.
"General Skywalker, white com."
The general moves to a control station and picks up a phone.
PHONE VOICE
"Sir, Captain Oxus has just been"
admitted to Med Vac.
SKYWALKER
What's his condition?
PHONE VOICE
"No data, sir."
SKYWALKER
I'm on my way.
21. MED VAC EMERGENCY ROOM - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - TOWNOWI
Captain Valor waits in an outer chamber as General Sky-
walker rushes into the Med Vac emergency room where
several doctors are working on the prostrate Oxus.
SKYWALKER
What's his condition? Is
he conscious?
DOCTOR
Partially. He'll be all right -
"a few bruises, primary exhaustion..."
Oxus thrashes around in a semi-conscious state. He sees
the general.
SKYWALKER
"What happened, boy? What's going on?"
OXUS (with difficulty)
The Royal Starforce is already on its
"way, not far behind me. They're going"
to attack.
SKYWALKER
Are you sure?
OXUS
I have tapes. A giant space fortress...
He struggles to give General Skywalker his ring.
SKYWALKER
As big as our Third Moon?
OXUS
Bigger. It's unlike anything
I've ever seen. Sophisticated
deflection systems - works in
opposition to the suns.
SKYWALKER
Then they will show up on our
screens at sunrise. They'll
attack before that.
The general rushes into the outer chamber where Captain
Valor is waiting for him.
SKYWALKER
Take the fastest landspeeder to
Chathos. Pick up Princess Zara -
and only Princess Zara. Return by
way of the Great Reef. Most speed.
Valor exits and the general goes to an intercom and
pushes several buttons.
SKYWALKER
Montross!
MONTROSS
Sir!
SKYWALKER
Full alert - everything! Get the
Royal Family back here.
MONTROSS
The princess is at Chathos. There
are no transports...
SKYWALKER
I've already sent Captain Valor for
"her! Contact the King, first priority."
He's probably still en route to Amsel.
Use the scan com. I'm on my way.
22. WAR ROOM - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - TOWNOWI
The war room is on full alert. Everyone is at attention
waiting for the command that will put each of them into
"action. The general enters a communication center,"
followed by many aides. Captain Montross and the com
aide salute.
MONTROSS
We're having a problem getting
"through, sir. There is a great"
deal of interference.
PRUE
It could be jamming.
SKYWALKER
Try a surface link through Amsel.
The aides go back to the com-link system to try to get a
line through to the King.
PRUE
We should be able to spot them at
sunrise. That's not too far off.
SKYWALKER
They'll attack with sunrise. Until
the King gives us the code to start
"the war computers, we'll just have"
to sit tight.
PRUE
"All units are on alert, sir."
SKYWALKER (to Montross)
Have you made contact yet? (to himself)
This is one hell of a way to run a war.
PRUE
Sir?
23. COURTYARD - ACADEMY OF CHATHOS - TOWNOWI
A landspeeder roars into a courtyard of the academy at
"Chathos. Valor jumps out, and runs up to the large,"
heavy doors of the academy. They are locked. He
bangs madly on the carved metallic door until finally
an old woman manages to swing it open. Valor rushes
"past her into the main courtyard, where Princess Zara"
"and her handmaiden, Mina, struggle with two large cases."
"They are followed by two very old matrons, dragging"
several more cases.
JUSTIN
Forget the cases; we've no time.
ZARA
These are my things. They must...
JUSTIN
"I said forget them, and hurry."
ZARA
Just who do you think you are?
"Valor grabs the princess by the arm, and hauls her to the"
speeder. Mina and the old women run after them.
ZARA
I will not be treated like this! You
bring my things. My father will have
your head (etc.)
"Zara struggles to break away from the young warrior's grasp,"
as he opens the door of the speeder.
JUSTIN
Settle down!
"When the door to the speeder is opened, Mina starts in,"
and Valor stops her.
JUSTIN
"You must stay. Here, take the crest."
Captain Valor rips the royal crest from the princess'
"neck, and hands it to the startled handmaiden. The old"
women gasp in horror. The princess starts hitting
Captain Valor with little result.
PRINCESS
Mina's not staying. I'm not leaving
her. You can't...
Valor punches her square on the jaw and knocks her cold.
"Mina is panic stricken, one of the old women faints, and"
another starts for Valor with a large staff.
JUSTIN
She'll be all right. I'm taking her
"to safety, as ordered. You will wear"
the crest and continue as before.
The authority of Captain Valor's voice stops the old lady.
"He places the princess into the speeder, and maneuvers it"
out of the courtyard. Mina puts on the crest as the speeder
races away from the academy.
24. WAR ROOM - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - TOWNOWI
"Queen Breha, Oeta and Puck are escorted into a rest area"
of the war room. General Skywalker sits rigidly in a chair
"in the communications area, apparently asleep."
MONTROSS
"We've made contact, sir!"
The general opens his eyes and takes the intercom mike.
KAYOS
"What is it, General?"
SKYWALKER
The Royal Starforce will attack on the
rising of the sun. My agent made it
back. I now have proof. I need the
war code.
KAYOS
I'll relay it directly to the computer.
Is Breha...?
SKYWALKER
The Royal Family is safe. Captain
Valor has gone after Princess Zara.
KAYOS
I'm on my way back.
25. RED PLAINS - TOWNOWI
The small caravan of four speeders sits motionless on the
vast red plains of Townowi. The King returns the intercom
to the pilot and takes a small metallic card from around
his neck and gives it to the co-pilot.
KAYOS
"Send this sub-land, priority one."
(to the pilot) Get us back to
CALVAS immediately!
The four speeders turn around and scream away in the
"direction from which they came. They pass a huge, ultra-"
sleek powerplow which is planting green fungus in endless
furrows. Two clay-covered farmers riding atop the pon-
derous machine watch the speeders disappear over the
horizon. The twin suns peek over the distant hillside.
and make their way into the vivid green sky. A bright
object twinkling in early morning heavens catches the
eye of the older of the two farmers and he brings the
machine to a lumbering halt. The younger farmer also
"notices the object and stares into the green sky, shading"
his eyes to get a better view.
"Suddenly there is a huge, bright atomic flash on the"
"horizon. A few moments later, a thunderous shaking,"
"followed by high winds, tumbles the older farmer from his"
perch. A second flash on the opposite horizon brings
"another jolting earthquake, and the younger farmer col-"
"lapses, terror frozen on his face."
26. READYROOM - SPACEPORT OUTPOST - TOWNOWI
Chaos - red scramble lights are flashing. Alert horns
and attack buzzers create an unbelievable cacophony.
"Air warriors, with the distinctive circle and cross"
"medallion on their white space suits, scramble out of"
"the low concrete readyroom, grabbing helmets and space-"
packs as they race out of the door.
27. ATTACK RUNWAY - SPACEPORT OUTPOST - TOWNOWI
Thirty pilots and navigators dash in unison to a line of
waiting two-man starships of the destroyer class. Ground
"crews scurry back and forth, loading last-minute armament"
"and unlocking power couplings. PILOT LEADER, a rugged,"
"handsome boy of twenty, gives his ground crew a signal"
that his is okay. He has a winning smile and a distinctive
scar along the side of his face. His crew chief pats him
on the back.
CHIEF
Knock them all the way back to
Granicus.
The canopy is closed and the powerful starship moves
onto the runway. Other crewmen say good-bye to their
"pilots, some grinning and others kidding - all with a"
great deal of hidden emotion. The din of four dozen
"retrorockets cuts through the uproar, and fifteen"
silver spacecraft leave the runway and disappear into
the morning cloud cover.
28. WAR ROOM - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - TOWNOWI
The general stands before a giant display of the
Townowian solar system. Montross signals the general.
MONTROSS
"They're away, sir. Fifteen from"
"Gordon, twenty from Amsel. All"
other spaceports were destroyed.
The King hasn't arrived yet.
SKYWALKER
Keep checking. Put the starship's
intercom over the P.A.
The general sits at one of the intercom panels and puts
on a headphone. A row of monitors is before him. He
turns to Montross.
SKYWALKER
Where are they?
29. SPACE - TOWNOWI IN ECLIPSE
The eerie reddish-yellow planet of Townowi slowly drifts
"into view from total eclipse. A small, bright speck,"
"orbiting the planet, sparkles in the light of the twin"
suns. The six deadly starships settle ominously into the
"foreground, moving swiftly toward the orbiting speck. As"
"the sleek starships move closer, the orbiting speck is"
revealed to be a gargantuan space fortress. The moon-
sized satellite fortress dwarfs the approaching fighters.
"Every few moments, explosions create blinding flashes on"
"the planet's surface, as the fortress bombards the planet"
with a fusillade of lazer bolts.
30. TOWNOWIAN STARSHIP - INTERIOR
"Pilot Leader, in the first ship, signals to his navigator"
"who sits in a small, isolated glass bubble to the rear of"
the craft. General Skywalker is seen on one of many
monitors. A view of the space fortress is on another.
The rest are filled with various computer readouts and
displays. One of the other starships reports to Pilot
Leader.
DEVIL SIX (intercom)
Look at the size of that thing!
"Hey, Coelo, I hope you remembered"
"to bring your pop gun, 'cause I"
think we caught us a big one this
time.
PILOT LEADER
"Cut off, Devil Six. Stand by."
SKYWALKER (monitor)
It looks like they're still using
the basic quad-tristation configura-
"tion. Use a ""ranger defense."""
Concentrate on breath ports and lock
areas.
PILOT LEADER
Affirmative base. Copy and transmit.
"Devil Two, check your rotation plates."
DEVIL TWO
"Roger, Boss. We're getting a thresh-"
hold disturbance on gyro-three.
SKYWALKER (monitor)
"Switch over, Five. Cover it!"
"Devil pack, generate a spread six"
formation. May the force of others
protect you.
PILOT
"Settle in. Devil pack, stand by."
"Mark five, break off. Here we go!"
31. SPACE - TOWNOWIAN STARSHIP
Fuel pods are jettisoned. The half-dozen fighters break
off into a powerline attack on the huge fortress. Multiple
"lazer bolts streak from the starships, creating small"
explosions on the complex surface of the fort.
32. INTERIOR MAIN CORRIDOR - ROYAL SPACE FORTRESS
The chaos of battle echoes through the vast corridors of
"the fortress. Walls buckle and cave in, sucking debris"
and personnel into the vacuum of outer space. Alarm
sirens scream as soldiers scramble to large turbo-powered
lazer gun emplacements. Sergeants yell orders through the
smoke and confusion. Men and robots of various shapes and
sizes run to their battle stations.
33. WAR ROOM - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - TOWNOWI
The monitors with pictures from the starships suddenly go
blank. Technicians check channels as others in the war
room silently listen to the action over the intercom. The
general remains calm but concerned.
PILOT LEADER (intercom)
"Tighten it up, Devil Two. Tighten it up."
Watch those towers.
DEVIL TWO
"Heavy fire, Boss, twenty-three degrees."
PILOT LEADER
I see it. Pull in. We're picking up some
interference.
DEVIL SIX
Wow! I've never seen such fire power.
PILOT LEADER
"Pull in, Devil Two. Pull in!"
DEVIL TWO
"I'm all right, Boss. I've got a target."
DEVIL SIX
There's too much action. Get out!
PILOT LEADER
"Break off...acknowledge. Devil Six,"
can you see Devil Two?
DEVIL SIX
I've lost him. There's a very heavy
fire zone on this side. My radar's
jammed.
DEVIL FIVE
"He's gone....No, wait. There he is."
"Fin damage, but he's all right."
A sigh of relief sweeps across the war room. The monitors
"flash on, then off again."
DEVIL FOUR (intercom)
"Watch your back, Boss! Watch your"
back!!
34. TOWNOWI STARSHIP
The speedy little fighters dart back and forth across the
"soft underbelly of the fortress, leaving a trail of des-"
truction behind them.
PILOT LEADER
"Converge on south axis point, point three"
nine four. It appears accessible. I'm
"going to map the surface. Devil Four,"
cover me.
Pilot Leader and Devil Four dive in unison through a forest
"of radar domes, antennae, and gun towers. Devil Four fires"
into the protrusions as the two starships criss-cross the
"surface of the fortress. Suddenly, a dense barrage of"
"lazerfire erupts from a tower, catching Devil Four broad-"
side. The spacecraft bursts into a million flaming pieces.
"Pilot Leader reacts to the loss of his wing man, but con-"
tinues on his mission.
35. SUB-HALLWAY - ROYAL SPACE FORTRESS
Constant explosions rock the interior of the fortress.
"Civilians, including women and children, scurry for safety"
"in the panic-ridden hallways. Two construction robots,"
"A-2 and C-3, are blown, slipping and sliding across the"
hallway floor into some freight canisters. Both robots
are rather old and battered. A-2 is a short (three feet)
"claw-armed triped. His face is a mass of computer lights,"
"surrounding a radar eye. C-3 is a tall, gleaming android of"
"human proportions. He is thin, with a totally metallic"
surface. The robots attempt to get out from under the
"canisters, but rushing gas from a broken pipe keeps knocking"
them over.
C-3
This is madness. We're going to be
destroyed. I'm still not accustomed
to space travel.
A-2
The external bombardment does appear
to be concentrated in this area. The
structure has exceeded the normal
"stress quotient by point four, although"
there appears to be no immediate danger.
C-3
No immediate danger! You're faulty.
This is madness!
A-2 gives C-3 a sheepish look and clings to a siderail for
"dear life, as debris flies through the hallway."
36. TOWNOWI STARSHIP
"Devil Two, a young hotshot of about sixteen years, miracu-"
"lously dives his ship through a virtual wall of lazerfire,"
and blasts a huge radar disc into dust. Devil Two signals
"his navigator, who lets out a whooping cheer as the craft"
veers into a victory roll.
PILOT LEADER
"Great moves, Devil Two. Re-group at point"
"two, zero one. Coincide, Devil Six."
SKYWALKER
"Devil One, your map projection shows a"
weak point at south portal: niner point
six. Concentrate the attack on that
point. Coordinate.
PILOT LEADER
I see it. It looks good.
Devil Five and Devil Three bob and weave in formation
toward a giant transformer jutting from the fort's
surface.
DEVIL THREE
I've got a... We're hit. We're hit!
PILOT LEADER
"Eject...Eject. Babs, Babs, do you read?"
DEVIL THREE
I'm okay. I can hold it. Clear me
"a little, Devil Five. Watch it!"
Watch it!
"Devil Three wobbles a little, then drops away sharply,"
"plowing into a lazergun emplacement, causing a hideous"
series of chain reaction explosions.
37. SUB-HALLWAY - ROYAL SPACE FORTRESS
A huge explosion rips a large hole in the ceiling of a sub-
hallway. A-2 and C-3 are in a state of shock as they
scramble through the rubble. There is a constant sound of
creaking and snapping as the sections of the hallway re-
settle in the fortress superstructure.
A-2
"You're a mindless, useless philosopher."
Come on! Let's go back to work; the
system is all right.
C-3
You overweight glob of grease. Quit
following me. Get away! Get away!
"Suddenly, the hallway lurches, and a dead trooper falls"
through a gaping hole in the ceiling. The foot of a carcass
"is caught in the rubble and it hangs upside down, staring at"
the two robots. A-2 grabs C-3 and they cling to each other
in terror.
A-2
We're lost. We're destroyed.
Three sharp blasts from an airhorn send the two androids
running for cover in a burned-out doorway. Five grim-
faced troopers riding small rocket platforms pass the
two mechanical men.
38. GOVERNOR'S QUARTERS - ROYAL SPACE FORTRESS
"The five troopers race through several hallways, and"
finally stop in front of an important-looking office
complex. Two officers dismount and enter the complex.
They pass through several heavily guarded doorways
until they reach the main chamber. Seated behind a large
"cluttered desk, surrounded by generals and attaches, is"
Governor Horus. General Vader paces in front of a row of
blank monitors. The two officers salute General Vader.
FIRST OFFICER
All com-link power is out. Twenty-
two transformer sections have been
destroyed. The situation is grave
on all southern levels. Com-link
communication should be repaired
shortly.
"The officers salute, turn and leave the chamber. The"
"general turns to Governor Horus, who looks a little"
worried.
VADER
Don't look so worried. Not even a
Dai could penetrate this fortress.
We've already wiped out most of
their forces.
HORUS
"If it goes on too long, we'll run"
over budget. When do the landings
begin?
VADER
As soon as the attack has been
broken: not long.
"A short, stocky attache salutes the general."
ATTACHE
Contamination has set in on quadrants
B-5 and R-4. All sections are sealed.
We've lost two major power stations
in the southern quadrants. That puts
section 5-1 in serious trouble.
The general turns away in controlled anger and embarrass-
ment.
39. WAR ROOM - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - TOWNOWI
"The general sits in a glass-enclosed computer station,"
watching the battle progress on several monitors. An
officer enters and salutes the general.
OFFICER
Analysis reports those ZQ configurations
are definitely power transformers. Every-
thing in the southern sectors of the
fortress is out.
SKYWALKER
I'm surprised they are still using exter-
nal power units. It's a definite weak
point. Concentrate on searching for the
main crosslink transformer.
The officer exits as Montross rushes in.
MONTROSS
The senate has voted to end the war.
SKYWALKER
They can't do anything without the
"King's approval, which gives us a"
little time. Have you been able to
regain contact with the King?
MONTROSS
"No, sir. All ground communications"
are jammed.
SKYWALKER
Send four men from third squad to
meet the King and escort him back.
Let me know before he arrives. Is
Captain Valor back with the princess?
MONTROSS
"No, sir. They're long overdue."
Pilot Leader checks in over the intercom.
PILOT LEADER
"All right, base one, we're in"
position.
An officer with headphones looks to the general. He
signals to attack.
40. TOWNOWI STARSHIPS
All four starships dive in formation toward a main trans-
former area flanked by several solar towers.
PILOT LEADER
Hold your fire until we're within point
zero five four. Make it count.
Several ack-ack lazers begin to open fire on the approaching
spacecraft. The starships direct their fire at a large
black transformer which when hit spurts bright blue and
white electrical arcs. One of the starships (Devil Five)
"explodes and careens out of formation, leaving an erratic"
"trail of smoke, before eventually crashing into a solar"
panel.
41. SUB-HALLWAYS - ROYAL SPACE FORTRESS
The impact of the exploding starship can be felt throughout
the giant fortress. The tall gleaming C-3 races through
"several corridors, yelling at A-2, who struggles vainly to"
keep pace with his stubby mechanical feet.
C-3
"I don't care what you do, but I'm"
getting out. All the power's out.
Those explosions are coming from
the reactor section. This is the
end. Abandon ship!
A-2
Our work - we can't leave! It's
desertion. It's not possible.
It's not possible.
C-3
Your programming is so limited.
My first order is preservation.
You stay. I'm going to eject
before the whole thing goes up.
C-3 breaks open the seal on an emergency lifepod. A
"red warning light begins to flash, and a low hum is"
heard. The lanky chrome android works his way into
the cramped four-man craft.
A-2
These lifepods aren't for us.
It's not right!
"A new explosion, this time very close, sends dust and"
debris through the narrow passageway. Flames lick at
the two robots. The runt-sized A-2 jumps into the
lifepod.
A-2
It's the end. Eject. Eject.
"The safety door snaps shut, and the pod ejects from the"
fortress.
42. TOWNOWI STARSHIPS
The terrified androids in the lifepod speed away from
the fortress and pass the attacking starships.
DEVIL TWO
Object approaching. Attack bearing.
DEVIL FOUR
It's a lifepod. Forget it. We've got...
"Devil Four is hit by lazerfire, and disintegrates, leaving"
a trail of flaming particles. The two remaining craft
continue the assault. Devil Two and Pilot Leader watch
the remains of Devil Four disappear. The general appears
over one of the monitors.
SKYWALKER
Analysis indicates transformer code
"zero three is the main relay. Hit it,"
and the whole thing goes dead.
PILOT LEADER
We're on our way.
43. GOVERNOR'S QUARTERS - ROYAL SPACE FORTRESS
"A row of monitors and the main overhead lights go on, and"
a trooper appears on one of the screens.
TROOPER
Internal relays operative. All
power restored. All contaminated
areas sealed.
An officer appears on another monitor.
OFFICER
Only two enemy craft remain operative.
We calculate victory by zero three
hundred.
General Vader switches to another monitor.
VADER
Alert the invasion forces. (turning
to the governor) The planet is ours.
A three-hour war. You expected
"longer. Dai or not, we've beaten"
"him, and the culture is intact."
HORUS
A truly great prize for the kingdom.
They have a treasure of biotic science.
"Genetics, cloning - they've added two"
"hundred years to a lifespan. Remember,"
you must capture at least one member of
the Royal Family alive. The Townowi
family has ruled this system for ten
thousand years. The people will follow
"no other. If the royal line is broken,"
there is a good chance the entire
population will destroy themselves and
their knowledge before submitting to our
rule.
The general is interrupted by a call on one of the
monitors.
OFFICER (on monitor)
We've received a message from the
planet.
44. WAR ROOM - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - TOWNOWI
General Skywalker watches a giant computer display of
the space fortress mapped by the starships. An aide
approaches.
AIDE
Sir! The King's convoy has destroyed
at Caldin. All the bodies were con-
taminated.
SKYWALKER
I will audience with the Queen.
Who knows of this?
AIDE
Many. It came through civilian
sources.
SKYWALKER
Confine Senator Sandage to his
quarters. Use any pretext. Where
is the senator now?
Sandage and several other senators enter the computer
station.
SANDAGE
"Right here, General. It's over."
We've already relayed peace terms
"to the kingdom, and they've been"
accepted. Your war has ended.
The general is angry and stands pointing at the senators.
"They jump back, as if the general were pointing a gun at"
them.
SKYWALKER
"Senator, this war isn't over. It's"
just begun. I take my commands
from the Royal Family.
SANDAGE
The Queen concurs. I have her
written decree. It is to be
implemented immediately. I order
you to cease the attack.
SKYWALKER
Not likely.
SANDAGE
Treason? Revolution? The people
"won't follow you, General, nor will"
your troops. I suggest you follow
your orders.
General Skywalker stands angrily pondering the situation.
"Sandage and the other senators are tense, a little afraid"
that he might cut them down on the spot.
SANDAGE
"Well, General?"
45. LIFEPOD - GREEN SKY OVER TOWNOWI
The reddish-yellow mass of Townowi seems to engulf the
"tiny lifepod containing the two fleeing androids, as it"
descends into the greenish atmosphere.
A-2
It's desertion. They'll destroy us.
How could this happen?
C-3
That's funny. The damage doesn't
look as bad from out here.
46. TOWNOWI STARSHIPS
Pilot Leader and Devil Two make a second dive on the now
smoldering transformer area. All firing from the fortress
"suddenly stops. Pilot Leader looks back to his navigator,"
who is equally puzzled. The two fighters continue to attack
the now silent fortress.
DEVIL TWO
I don't get it. What do you
"think, Boss?"
General Skywalker appears on the monitors.
SKYWALKER (with difficulty)
"Base one to Devil Leader, scramble code"
niner. Break your attack and return to
"base. Repeat, break your attack."
Confirm.
PILOT LEADER
"They're hurt, sir, but they still have"
power. We should finish...
SKYWALKER
Break off. The war is over. Run on
"white lights. Get back here, Mace."
We're going to need you.
PILOT LEADER
Confirmed base one. We're on our way.
"Did you copy, Devil Two?"
DEVIL TWO
"Roger, Boss."
The two starfighters break off the attack and start back
"toward the planet. Without warning, the fort directs"
concentrated fire at the two starfighters. Devil Two
"instantly bursts into flames, then disintegrates. Pilot"
"Leader's tail section is hit, and the ship pinwheels"
toward the planet. Blood covers Pilot Leader's immobile
face.
PILOT LEADER'S NAVIGATOR
We're under fire. They're still shooting.
I thought it was over. We're hit! We're
hit! Pilot is dead.... Ejecting.
"The dead Pilot Leader is jettisoned free of the craft, but"
"the navigator's eject panel is dead. He struggles with it,"
then bangs on the canopy to no avail. The navigator is
"still trapped in the craft when it explodes, leaving only"
a puff of pink smoke reflected in the rim light of the
planet.
47. DESERT NEAR OUTPOST - TOWNOWI
Pilot Leader's dead body drifts toward his arid mother-
planet. Automatic rockets kick in occasionally to direct
and soften the landing. Two gray-clad troopers stand next
"to a military landspeeder, watching the descending air-"
warrior through electrobinoculars. Mace's corpse hits the
"ground rather hard, creating a whirlwind of dust, and the"
two troopers rush over to the pilot. The younger of the
"two troopers, a young boy in his teens, cradles the dead"
starpilot in his arms and begins to cry.
48. WAR ROOM - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - TOWNOWI
"General Skywalker sits alone, meditating in the deserted"
war room. Montross approaches the contemplative general.
MONTROSS
No sign of Captain Valor or the
princess. There was much damage
in that area. The Queen will see
you at ten hundred.
The general doesn't reply.
49. ASSEMBLY - DEPARTURE AREA - ROYAL SPACE FORTRESS
General Vader stands behind a row of men at computer
"control panels overlooking a huge assembly of troop,"
"tanks, and transports. A commander reports to the general."
COMMANDER
All enemy craft destroyed. First
and fifth division troops and
equipment standing by.
The general gives a sly smile of approval and takes a
microphone from one of the computer technicians. He
speaks to the troops and pilots waiting in their huge
war machines for the invasion order.
VADER
The war is won. With the conquering
"of this system, we have ushered in a"
new millennium for the New Galactic
Kingdom which will echo throughout the
universe. Our reward is the knowledge
this system possesses. This planet
must be controlled with a minimum
"of force, but you must not think"
lightly of this enemy. They have
exacted a heavy toll. Today you will
make the kingdom complete. Do so with
pride and care.
"Vader puts down the mike, and turns to his commander."
VADER
Let the invasion begin.
50. EDGE OF THE DUNE SEA - TOWNOWI
"KUROLAND, or ""No-Man's Land,"" where the rugged desert"
mesas meet the foreboding dune sea. The two helpless astro
robots kick up clouds of dust as they clumsily work their
way across the desert coastline. The short A-2 struggles
desperately to keep up with the long-legged C-3.
A-2
It's not possible. We're not
built for this. You're nothing
"more than a dim-witted, emotion"
brained intellectual. Why you
were created is beyond my logic
"systems. Thanks to you, we're"
"now deserters, and will probably"
be destroyed on sight. And on
"top of that, you're going the"
wrong way! All this filth is
getting...
The towering C-3 stops short and turns on the blabbering
mechanical runt.
C-3
"I've had enough of you, you"
"pragmatic, nearsighted scrap"
pile. You go your own way.
He picks up the tiny robot and tosses him several feet into
a large sand dune. C-3 starts off in the direction of the
dune sea. A-2 struggles to his feet and shakes a metallic
claw arm at his disappearing ex-partner.
A-2
You'll be malfunctioning within a
"day. You're going the wrong way,"
but your way is always the wrong
way.
C-3 stops and yells to the smaller android.
C-3
And don't let me catch you following
"me, begging for help, because you"
won't get it from me.
"A-2's reply is a rather rude sound, which only an electronic"
person could make. He turns and trudges off in the opposite
direction into the rocky desert mesas.
51. DUNE SEA - TOWNOWI
"C-3, hot and tired, struggles up over the ridge of the dune,"
"only to find more dunes, which seem to go on for endless"
miles. He looks back in the direction he came.
C-3
You little malfunctioning twerp.
This is all your fault. You tricked
"me into going this way, but you'll do"
no better!
"He sits in a huff of anger and frustration, knocking the"
sand from his joints.
52. DESERT MESA - TOWNOWI
A-2 stumbles through a narrow canyon until he climbs over
a small boulder and sees before him a sight he first thinks
is a mirage. Nestled in a rock formation is a deserted
landspeeder. Once the little robot is convinced that he
"is alone, he approaches the battered speeder and begins to"
analyze it. He climbs into the pilot's seat and attempts
to start the unfamiliar transport. He hears a sound and
"stops for a moment. He sees nothing, so he continues to"
fiddle with the control panel until the speeder lurches
"forward with a start, banging into a large rock. The"
"stubby android is shaken, but neither he nor the speeder"
seems to be damaged.
"Shivers run down A-2's metal spine, and again he has an"
eerie feeling that he is being watched. He slowly looks
"around and sees a large man, Captain Valor, standing"
"directly behind him. He is startled, then terrified."
JUSTIN
Where is your master?
"The little robot clicks and rattles, but doesn't speak."
JUSTIN (Cont.)
Can't you speak? How do you relate
your data? You're of Karollian manu-
facture. You should be able to talk.
Are you damaged?
Valor pokes at the machine but doesn't see any damage.
A-2 eyes him suspiciously. The robot turns with a start
"and discovers a young girl, Princess Zara, has been"
standing next to him for some time.
PRINCESS (sarcastically)
"Well, General, who's your friend?"
JUSTIN
I don't know. He doesn't seem to
"be able to talk. Damaged, probably..."
Jettisoned from a damaged ship...
PRINCESS
What do you intend to do with it?
JUSTIN
We'll take it with us. Could be a
storehouse of valuable information.
Justin guides the android into the small luggage area
"behind the front seat, then hops into the driver's seat."
PRINCESS
I don't want to ride with that thing.
I order you to destroy it immediately.
JUSTIN
Get in! We've got to hurry if we're
"going to get across the ""dunehedge"""
"by nightfall. You're coming, one way"
or the other. Will you join us peace-
ably?
"The princess reluctantly gets into the speeder, and it starts"
with a jolt.
53. LANDSPEEDER - DESERT MESAS - TOWNOWI
"The speeder flies along, a foot or so above the landscape."
PRINCESS
You are such a barbarian. I'll have
my father cut you into little pieces
when we get back...and I'll take
"pleasure in feeding you to the Gonthas,"
a little bit each day. I may save your
eyes though. I'll have them petrified
and made into a necklace.
JUSTIN
Your sweetness is only surpassed by your
"beauty. Just try to remember, I'm only"
following orders.
PRINCESS
To beat and abuse me?
JUSTIN
I'm afraid I've only learned one way
to treat wild animals.
"A-2 thrashes about, trying to relieve the pressure on his"
cramped legs.
PRINCESS
You stay out of this.
54. DUNE SEA
C-3 struggles to the top of a large dune. He is dirty and
hot. His plight seems hopeless. He searches the horizon
for any sign of life. A glint of reflected light in the
distance reveals an object speeding toward him. The
chrome android waves frantically and yells at the
approaching speeder. The sleek landspeeder races past
"him about a hundred yards away. He runs after it,"
"screaming in desperation, until he stumbles and falls"
"head over heels down an enormous sand dune. Silently,"
the speeder sweeps around in a circle and stops behind
the immobile robot. Valor jumps out of the speeder and
is quickly followed by A-2.
PRINCESS
"We're in a hurry, remember! If"
you're going to stop for every
"unfortunate along the way, we'll"
never get back. We're lucky you
got the speeder running as it is.
A-2 waddles up to his fallen partner and starts pulling on
"his leg, then runs up and starts pulling on his arm."
A-2
Function! Function! It's me.
"Come on, function."
VALOR
"Well, my little friend, you've"
found your tongue.
A-2
We must help him. We've been
lost.
VALOR
Where did you come from?
The little robot runs around his fallen partner giving him
small electric charges from his claw hand. C-3 shudders
"from head to toe, then regains consciousness."
C-3
What happened?
A-2
You're overheated.
VALOR
Where did you come from?
A-2
We were jettisoned from six twenty-
nine P.R. one.
VALOR
I'm unfamiliar with that ship.
What type is it?
C-3
"It's a class M station, not a"
conventional craft.
C-3 then stands and shakes the young Dai's hand.
C-3
"I'm C-3, Human-Cyborg Relations."
Your kindness is greatly appreciated.
Captain valor and the two robots walk back to the speeder.
55. LANDSPEEDER - DESERT CANYON - TWONOWI
Both A-2 and C-3 are stuffed into the tiny luggage com-
partment. It is late in the day when the speeder rumbles
to a stop in a small desert canyon surrounded by steep
cliffs and broken boulders.
JUSTIN
We'll rest here.
C-3
At last. The transport is welcome
but my joints are frozen.
Everyone climbs out of the low-slung speeder. Valor
watches the two androids as they stretch their mechanical
limbs.
A-2
I've got a bad case of dust contami-
nation. I can barely move.
C-3
What a foresaken place this is. We
seem to be made to suffer. It's
"our lot in life. Sir, could you"
tell...?
C-3 turns and notices that Valor and the princess have
disappeared. He looks all around.
C-3
Where did they go? They've dis-
appeared.
A-2
Maybe they were attacked.
I sense danger!
56. HIDDEN FORTRESS ENTRANCE - DESERT CANYON - TOWNOWI
Captain Valor and Princess Zara hurry through a maze of
large boulders until they reach a sheer rock face. Valor
looks around to see if they were followed. Suddenly a
large section of the rock slides away revealing a well-
lit corridor carved out of the rock. They enter and are
greeted by two jubilant guards. Valor gives them some
orders and points in the direction of the speeder. The
secret rock door silently slides closed.
57. MAIN HALLWAY - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - TOWNOWI
Captain Valor and the princess are greeted by General
Skywalker and Montross. They bow before the princess.
PRINCESS (angrily pointing at Valor)
"General, I want you to do something"
with this...this barbarian. Where's
my father?
GENERAL
"The King is dead, Your Highness."
All anger suddenly drains from the princess. She almost
timidly asks the next question.
PRINCESS
My mother?... and brothers?
GENERAL
"She's here. She's safe, so are your"
brothers. They're in the main chamber.
"Zara, now looking more like a frightened young girl than"
"a vindictive princess, runs down the hallway toward the"
main chamber. She vainly attempts to hold back the tears.
58. DESERT CANYON - TOWNOWI
"The two puzzled androids sit on the landspeeder, pondering"
the disappearance of their saviour.
C-3
Do you suppose we're in danger?
A-2
The logic of this environment
escapes me.
"As night begins to fall, and the shadows begin to lengthen,"
the two robots begin to get a little edgy. The sound of
"approaching feet startles A-2, and he ducks behind his"
taller friend. Two guards approach the robots.
GUARD
"You will remain calm, and you will"
remain here.
C-3
"Certainly. I'm C-3, Human Cyborg"
Relations. Your kindness is greatly
appreciated.
A-2 sits rather suspiciously behind his extroverted friend.
59. ROYAL CHAMBER - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - TOWNOWI
General Skywalker bows low before Princess Zara. She sits
"on a raised platform, dressed in the royal robes of a"
planetary ruler. The Queen sits off to one side on a
smaller platform. The princess waits for a few moments
before she allows the general to rise.
QUEEN
The senate has been corrupted.
SKYWALKER
They cannot rule without your
wish.
QUEEN
I rule by marriage. With the King
"dead, I am not strong enough to stop"
them. Zara is now the true Queen.
She must be protected. The line must
be preserved. I am placing the
future of our people in your hands.
You must deliver Zara and her
brothers to the OPHUCHI System.
"They will be safe there. General,"
you must understand. I had no
alternative but to condone an end
to the hostilities. I deeply
believe your campaign could have
"been successful, but there are"
things that...
SKYWALKER
"I understand, Your Highness."
QUEEN
The chrome companies on Ophuchi have
offered to supply you with the men
and ships necessary to return Zara
to the throne.
SKYWALKER
Can the chrome companies be trusted?
QUEEN
The price for their cooperation is
high. It is waiting for you in
Med Center blue. Guard it as you
would the princess herself. No-one
must know of this mission. There
are those among the trusted who
would wish us ill. Take only two
"of your best officers with you, the"
most loyal. May the force of others
be with you.
ZARA
"Mother, you must not stay."
QUEEN
I am too old for such a journey. The
kingdom already controls the space-
port cities. You have a long way to
travel. It won't be easy.
SKYWALKER
We will have to travel in disguise.
I must have full command. No-one
can suspect wealth or royal training.
I fear the new Queen will not stand
for this.
ZARA
Do not put words into my mouth.
I will stand for what is necessary.
The general simply smiles.
60. SUB-HALLWAY - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - TOWNOWI
"The general walks briskly through an isolated hallway,"
closely followed by Montross.
SKYWALKER
How is Captain Oxus? recovery?
MONTROSS
Very good; he's up and around.
SKYWALKER
"Fine! Have Oxus and...ah, Captain"
Valor report at zero three hundred.
"I want two converted transports,"
"agricultural type, and two days'"
"provisions, travel papers, weapons."
Contact Han Solo at the Gordon
spaceport. I'll talk to him...with
speed!
Montross turns and rushes down another hallway.
61. MEDICAL CENTER BLUE - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - TOWNOWI
The general enters a stark white waiting area filled
with scholarly looking gentlemen. An attendant greets
General Skywalker and takes him into a small observation
chamber overlooking a large operating theatre. An
elderly doctor greets him.
DOCTOR
"Good to see you, General. I'm afraid"
we're not quite ready yet. Thank God
"you'll be the one taking them, though."
An attendant brings in one of the scholars from the waiting
area and places him on a large operating table surrounded
by strange looking equipment. An ominous looking clamp is
placed on the man's head.
SKYWALKER
How many are going?
DOCTOR
Thirty-three of the greatest scientific
minds in our system...A high price for
freedom.
SKYWALKER
Thirty-three scientists! Transporting
"a group that size, undetected... I don't..."
DOCTOR
"Don't worry, General. All you'll be"
taking are their minds.
The doctor moves over to a safe-like cabinet guarded by
two attendants. The doctor gingerly picks up a small
clear vial filled with gray fluid. It has a label which
"reads: Faubun, Astro-dynamics. In the background , the"
scholar on the operating table is undergoing a form of
mechanized brain surgery.
SKYWALKER
"""Bloodory's distillation?"""
DOCTOR
Yes. It has been greatly perfected.
The brain is condensed into five
ounces of fluid. Cloning cell samples
are included so that a structural
duplicate of the scientist can be
reproduced. When the duplicate child
"reaches the age of six, he or she"
begins a series of injections of the
"brain fluid. By the age of ten years,"
they have received all the knowledge
and memory of an experienced scientist:
an old mind in a young body. We have
prepared a special shock belt to carry
the vials.
"In the background, the limp body of the scholar on the"
"operating table is removed, and another scientist is"
"escorted into the operating threatre. Dr. Bloodory, a"
"portly doctor in his forties, enters the room and shakes"
hands with the general.
DOCTOR
"General, this is Dr. Bloodory."
He'll be making the trip with
you.
BLOODORY
"It's an honor to meet you, General."
I'm sure I couldn't be in safer
hands.
SKYWALKER
The chrome companies are exacting
a high price indeed! Politics will
be the ruin of us all.
BLOODORY
Careful. If we could rid ourselves
"of the politicians, generals would"
no longer be necessary.
DOCTOR
We should be ready by zero three
hundred.
"The doctors exit, leaving the general alone to watch the"
huge machine extract another brain.
62. SPACEPORT - OBSERVATION DECK - TOWNOWI
"Governor Horus, General Vader walk down a boarding ramp to"
an observation deck overlooking the conquered city of
Gordon. They are followed by a number of aides and officers
"from the royal fleet. Below them, air tanks and other"
military equipment and supplies are being unloaded.
VADER
Not much of a planet.
HORUS
"Darth, you've done well. Do you"
think you will have the Royal
Family by nightfall?
VADER
An advance expedition is already
on its way to their underground
hideaway. They should reach it
"by nightfall, but only if this"
Count Sandage can be trusted.
HORUS
A man hungry for power can always
be trusted... to betray those in
power. I'm sure his information
is correct.
63. HIDDEN FORTRESS CANYON -TOWNOWI
"The huge rock face of the canyon opens, and two shabby"
agricultural landspeeders are pushed into the late after-
noon sun. A-2 and C-3 stand on the far side of the canyon
with their guards watching in amazement. The general and
Captain Valor walk behind the men pushing the landspeeder.
SKYWALKER
We'll take them with us. They
know more about that fortress
than any ten men. They will be
very useful.
JUSTIN
Can they be trusted?
SKYWALKER
Loyalty can't be programmed.
They can be trusted never to
"harm a living creature, and to"
always give accurate information
"as they know it, to anyone who"
asks. You just have to remember
not to tell them anything that
you don't want to fall into the
wrong hands.
The general approaches the two robots. A-2 shyly moves
around his taller companion.
SKYWALKER
Greetings. I'm Luke: Agricultural
Engineering. We're going to be
travelling together. You're going
with us to help set up a hortastation
on KANDALAR.
C-3 shakes hands with the general.
C-3
I'm C-3: Human Cyborg Relations.
Your kindness is greatly appreciated.
C-3 and the general both look down at A-2. C-3 gives the
smaller android a little kick.
A-2
A-2: Fusion Repair.
SKYWALKER
Load them into one of the speeders.
"Captain Oxus, walking with a slight limp, emerges from the"
underground fortress with the Royal Family. A small group
"of guards and aides are lined up, standing at attention."
"The two young princes, Oeta and Puck, hug and kiss their"
"mother good-bye, then jump into the back of the larger"
"four-man speeder. The princess bows before her mother,"
then embraces her. Tears roll down her cheeks. Her
mother wipes them away.
QUEEN
You must learn strength.
The princess turns and moves to the larger speeder where
she is helped aboard by Captain Valor.
PRINCESS (fuming)
"I don't need your help, thank you."
She gives the general an angry look.
SKYWALKER
I'm afraid he's necessary.
A commotion erupts at the mouth of the underground fortress.
"Count Sandage, several senators and ten to twelve troopers"
rush into the canyon and block the speeders.
SANDAGE
Where are you going? What is
this?
In one quick movement the general moves between Sandage and
the Queen. Oxus and Valor assume defensive positions in
front of the princess and her brothers.
QUEEN
Zara and the boys are being taken to
safety. It is my wish.
SANDAGE
The King has assured their safety.
They must stay.
QUEEN
It is not my wish....
SANDAGE
"General, you've gone too far this"
time. (to the troops) Arrest him.
"Five troops start to move on the general, as Sandage draws"
"his lazerpistol. Before anyone can complete his action, the"
general ignites his lazersword and cuts the senator in two.
"He drops to the ground in a heap, and the approaching troops"
stop in their tracks.
QUEEN
Stop this!
"The general, Valor, and Oxus replace their swords, and bow"
"low to the Queen. All of the troops, senators, and aides"
do the same. The formalness of the occasion is broken when
the Queen embraces the general. She then turns and embraces
"each of the captains. They are both flustered, and somewhat"
embarrassed.
QUEEN
May the force of others be with you.
"The general and his captains head for the speeders, while"
the Queen and all the others return to the underground
fortress.
64. DESERT BLUFF - TOWNOWI
The two speeders edge their way onto a bluff overlooking the
hidden fortress canyon. They stop for one last reflective
"moment. Forced to leave their closest friends and relatives,"
"the group is deeply moved. The two robots, for the most"
"part, are puzzled. Suddenly, there is a huge atomic flash,"
"followed by a loud rumble, and the entire canyon collapses"
into a large crater. The group quietly watches the dust
settle. The hidden fortress and all its inhabitants have
"been destroyed. The general watches the princess, who"
appears to take it well.
SKYWALKER
It was the only way we could be
safe from treachery.
65. DUNE SEA - TOWNOWI
The two sleek landspeeders glide effortlessly through the
vast hills and valleys of the dune sea. At the base of the
"towering ridge, the four-man speeder stops. The smaller"
"speeders, with Valor and the two robots, makes its way to the"
top of the ridge. Captain Valor stops the speeder just short
of the top of the ridge. He gets out and continues the rest
of the way on foot. The young captain peeks over the ridge
into the canyon below. Muted sounds and large dust clouds
rise from the canyon floor. Valor immediately ducks back
behind the ridge with an amazed look on his face. He
quickly returns to the speeder and picks up the intercom.
JUSTIN
"Sir, you'd better take a look at"
this. But come easy.
The four-man speeder starts with a crack and slowly moves
up the side of the imposing dune. It stops next to the
smaller speeder. The general and Oxus get out and make
their way to the top of the ridge where they join Valor.
"Far in the distance, crossing the endless dune sea, is the"
royal invasion army. It is immense. A convoy of giant
"tanks, troop carriers, and supply ships stretch from"
"horizon to horizon. Cavalry, mounted on giant dunebirds"
ride the line from one end of the convoy to the other.
Hundreds of troops ride one-man jetsticks in precision
formation. Their lances form a giant pin-cushion. It is
an awesome sight.
SKYWALKER
They're coming from the spaceport at
"Anchorhead, which means they control"
everything between here and the space-
port at Gordon.
JUSTIN
Can we go around them?
SKYWALKER
No. We'll have to wait for them to
"pass. Captain Valor, see if you can"
monitor any of their communications
on the com-link in the big speeder.
Valor returns to the speeder. He collapses in the large
speeder next to the princess and flips on the com-link
"radio, moving back and forth across the dial."
PRINCESS
Must you do that?
Valor smiles rather sarcastically.
JUSTIN
Orders... The invasion force has cut
us off. We'll probably be here for
some time. You ought to stretch a
bit.
PRINCESS
"Is that a command, General? Maybe I"
feel like watching after my brothers.
Valor looks back at the two sleeping boys.
JUSTIN
They're not going anywhere. They're
asleep.
PRINCESS
I want to stay with them.
66. LIBRARY - PALACE OF LITE - TOWNOWI
The King's old library has been converted into an office
for General Vader. He is sitting behind his desk as
Captain Dodona of the Lettow legions enters and salutes.
The legionnaire is dressed in the fascist black and chrome
uniform of the legendary Lettow One Hundred. The general
returns his salute.
VADER
"Welcome, Captain Dodona. Your"
exploits are legendary. I have
long waited to meet you. If there
"is any way I can assist you, my"
entire command is at your bidding.
DODONA
I want a tie-in to your computer
"network, a control center, and"
communication access.
VADER
Right away! I'll also transfer
all information we have on the general.
"His command post was destroyed, but we"
believe he is still alive. Do you
really believe he's a Dai?
DODONA
If he was not a Dai I wouldn't be
here.
67. WASTELAND - TOWNOWI
The speeders make their way across the gray desert. It is
dawn. The twin suns have yet to rise in the green sky. The
"speeders are coated with dust and grime, indicating that"
they have travelled far. The two captains drive through the
night as everyone else sleeps. Valor calls Oxus on the
intercom.
JUSTIN
How are your fuel packs? I'm reading
minus four.
OXUS
I'm too low to transfer any.
"The general, who appeared to be asleep, opens his eyes, and"
takes the microphone from Oxus.
SKYWALKER
There is a fuel station fourteen
degrees by two meters. The occu-
pation force should have control
"of it by now, so hide your weapons,"
but keep them within reach.
68. FUEL STATION - TOWNOWI
A series of low concrete structures rise out of the desert.
The speeders stop in front of an old weather-beaten block
house. The rusted hulk of a landspeeder lies half-buried
to one side of the building. Valor and Oxus jump out of the
speeder and go into the block house.
69. INTERIOR - FUEL STATION - TOWNOWI
"The two young captains, dressed as farmers, enter the dingy"
little fuel station. It is quiet. A few power packs line
the walls and a dismantled speeder rests in the repair bay.
There is a sharp dripping sound coming from the speeder. It
appears that no-one is there.
JUSTIN
Greetings! Who's in charge here?
"They look around the deserted station, but find no attendant."
An eerie quiet pervades the building.
OXUS
I don't get it.
JUSTIN
You don't have to. It's abandoned.
"Oxus opens a door leading to a storage area, and stops"
short.
OXUS
Not quite abandoned.
"Valor moves to the doorway and sees the attendant, his wife,"
"and small daughter hanging upside down, tortured to death."
Oxus cuts them down.
OXUS
They shouldn't have resisted.
Valor grabs two power packs from the shelf.
JUSTIN
Help me with these power packs.
We'd better move out of here.
Oxus covers the family with an old work tarp. He bows to
"the dead, then reluctantly grabs a couple of power packs"
and they start for the door. Oxus stops for a moment.
OXUS
Hear that? Someone's here. (yelling)
We're friends. Show yourself.
Silence. Oxus shrugs his shoulders and they start out the
"door, only to run straight into a burly stormtrooper."
STORMTROOPER
Get out of here!
70. FUEL STATION - TOWNOWI
Oxus and Valor are pulled out of the doorway and shoved into
the center of a group of fifteen or twenty royal storm-
troopers who have surrounded the two speeders. Several
troops have pulled General Skywalker out of the speeder. He
"acts senile, like a man twice his age."
SKYWALKER
I'm all right. I can still move
about by myself.
A rough looking sergeant grabs Captain Oxus.
SERGEANT
What are you doing here?
OXUS
"We're out of power, sir."
SERGEANT
Let me see your passes!
OXUS
"I have it here, somewhere. We've"
"been relocated to a hortastation,"
by royal order...
"Oxus fumbles to retrieve something from his pocket, and"
eventually pulls out a small round disc. The sergeant
puts the disc in a small portable reader. Various computer
readouts are displayed on the monitor. Valor starts to put
a power pack into one of the speeders.
SERGEANT
What are you doing there? All
power has been restricted.
SKYWALKER
"We've run out. We must have power,"
or be forced to stay here and
become your responsibilities.
The sergeant thinks about this for a moment as the old
wise general watches him. Tension fills the air. Valor
shuffles around to a position where he can reach his weapon.
A trooper hands the sergeant a message.
SERGEANT (to Oxus)
Take only two of those power packs
and then move out quickly.
"The sergeant hurries to a military craft, where he takes a"
call on an intercom. General Skywalker and his two young
captains load the remaining power packs into the speeder
and roar away from the station.
71. WASTELAND - TOWNOWI
The speeders race along through the rocky desert wasteland.
The general speaks into the intercom to Valor
SKYWALKER
Keep a close watch. If that sergeant
runs an analysis on those passes we
might be seeing him again. We should
be safely inside Gordon within the day.
Everyone is in good spirits. The princess and her young
"brothers sing a Townowi melody, which is transmitted to Valor"
"in the smaller speeder. The general takes little Puck, and"
lets him sit on his lap in the forward compartment of the
speeder. A-2 flexes C-3's arm back and forth attempting
to discover the cause of a loud squeak.
A-2
Oilar doesn't seem to help at all.
C-3
It's all this filth and dust. This
environment is murderous.
Valor notices a small speck on the horizon.
JUSTIN (into intercom)
"Object approaching, bearing three"
point two.
The general looks through an electrotelescope mounted in the
speeder. He spots a distant row of troopers riding strange
dune birds.
SKYWALKER (to Justin)
It's a patrol. It could mean trouble.
We'd better split up. You stay on a
direct course. We'll meet you at the
western edge of ravine 23-64. Stay in
contact.
"The larger speeder makes a sharp left turn, speeding off"
across a deep ravine. Valor can begin to distinguish the
approaching troopers.
JUSTIN
It looks like there are ten of them.
They're heading right for me. Wait
a second. They've disappeared. I've
lost them.
SKYWALKER
Continue on ahead.
72. WASTELAND LAKEBED - TOWNOWI
Oxus deftly maneuvers the bulky speeder through a narrow
boulder-strewn ravine. They eventually come out on a dry
"lake bed, where they stop. Standing not more than a hundred"
"feet away, apparantly waiting for the speeder, are five"
royal troops on their dune birds.
SKYWALKER
"We've found them, five of them,"
anyway. Watch yourself.
The troops slowly ride their huge birds over to the speeder
and dismount. The officer in charge is a vicious looking
warrior with a large scar across his face.
OFFICER
Let me see your passes.
"Oxus hands him the small pass disc, and he places it in his"
reader. He studies the computer readout for a few moments
and then returns the disc to Oxus.
OFFICER
Have you seen any other transports
in this area?
SKYWALKER
We saw two heading south. Going
"towards Ansel, looked like to me."
OFFICER
All right. Be on your way.
"The officer mounts his dune bird, and the patrol moves away."
"Oxus winks at the princess and smiles at the general, as"
the speeder starts off across the dry lake. The general
fiddles with the intercom.
SKYWALKER
"Captain Valor, are you clear?"
JUSTIN
I have five troopers approaching.
Any problem your end?
SKYWALKER
We came through all right. You
"shouldn't have any trouble, but stay"
alert.
JUSTIN
Best wishes! Here they come.
"Everyone rides along in silence, a little worried about"
"Captain Valor, especially the princess."
PRINCESS
Do you think he'll be all right?
SKYWALKER
He can take care of himself.
Oeta is looking out the back window of the speeder.
OETA
Hey look! They're coming back.
Everyone looks to see the patrol quickly gaining on them.
SKYWALKER
Stop! They're faster. Get
your weapon.
The speeder screeches to a halt in a cloud of dust. The
general and his captain jump from the transport with lazer-
"pistols drawn. The patrol bears down on them, swords drawn,"
at full charge. Both the general and Oxus fire. Two of the
troopers and their dunebirds explode in a cloud of smoke.
The remaining three troopers are upon the duo in a matter
of seconds. The general ignites his lazersword and cuts down
two of the troops as they pass. The last turns his bird
"around before reaching the speeder, and hightails it back"
towards the ravine. The general jumps onto one of the
riderless dunebirds and takes off in pursuit. Oxus checks
the dead troopers.
73. WASTELAND RAVINE - TOWNOWI
The general rides at breakneck speed after the fleeing
"trooper. His lazersword is raised high over his head, ready"
to deal a deathblow. The lumbering birds race through the
winding ravine.
74. WASTELAND RAVINE - TOWNOWI
The intercom warning buzzer begins to scream. Oxus rushes
for it but the princess gets there first.
PRINCESS
Are you all right?
JUSTIN
Two riders heading your way. I
"got three, but two got away."
Watch yourselves!
75. WASTELAND RAVINE - TOWNOWI
The general is riding neck and neck with the trooper. He
swiftly brings his sword down and the trooper drops from
his saddle. The momentum of his charge carries the general
around a bend in the ravine and right inTO the path of two
more troops charging down on him. The two troopers are
taken by surprise. They stop their birds and so does the
"general. They stand there, about fifty yards apart, sizing"
"up each other. Suddenly, the two troopers start for the Dai"
warrior at full speed. The general raises his sword and
starts for them. The troopers are no match for the general
who kills them both before they are even able to swing their
swords.
76. WASTELAND LAKEBED - TOWNOWI
Valor stops near the larger landspeeder and gets out. He
is wounded. Blood streams from his left arm. Oxus rushes
to help him. The princess shows a great deal ofconcern.
OXUS
It looks worse than it is. You'll
be all right.
"Oxus motions to the princess, who looks a little relieved."
OXUS
Bring me the med aid pack.
PRINCESS
"It he was clumsy enough to get hurt,"
maybe we ought to let him bleed to
death.
"She hands Oxus the kit, as the general rides up and dis-"
mounts. He moves to Valor.
SKYWALKER
You missed two.
JUSTIN
I know. I couldn't...
SKYWALKER
Don't let it happen again.
We'd better move out. They might
have reported in.
77. CONTROL ROOM - PALACE OF LITE - TOWNOWI
The dark and sinister Dodona moves several markers on a
large map readout to form a line from the destroyed under-
ground fortress to the spaceport at Gordon. An aide enters
with General Vader.
AIDE
"The patrol was lost, sir. All"
ten of them.
DODONA
It's to be expected.
VADER
Have you found them?
DODONA
They're heading for the spaceport
at Gordon. I'm going there. Have
all security doubled. Make it an
alert.
78. THE OUTSKIRTS OF GORDON - TOWNOWI
The speeders stop on a bluff overlooking a small cantina on
the outskirts of Gordon. The spaceport can be seen in the
distance. The general and Captain Oxus walk over to the
smaller speeder. Valor helps the two androids out of their
cramped quarters.
C-3
Your kindness is greatly appreciated.
JUSTIN (to Skywalker)
I'm fit enough to...
The general gives him a hard look and he shuts up. Oxus
and the general climb into the speeder.
SKYWALKER
We'll make contact at zero four
hundred. If we're not back by
"fifty-five forty, get worried."
The speeder starts off toward the cantina.
79. SPACEPORT CANTINA - TOWNOWI
The speeder pulls up in front of the low blockhouse style
cantina. Various strange forms of transport are parked out-
side the bar.
SKYWALKER
Take care here. If there is any
"trouble, get back to the others."
The general and Oxus enter the shabby cantina. The murky
little den is filled with a startling array of weird and
"exotic alien creatures, laughing at the bar. At first, the"
"sight is horrifying. One-eyed, thousand-eyed, slimy, furry,"
scaly armed creatures with tentacles and claws huddle over
"drinks. The general looks over the patrons, but does not"
"see the contact, Han Solo. A large multiple-eyed creature"
shoves the general.
CREATURE
Assha dughi wouldugga?
The general tries to ignore the creature and turns back to
his drink. A short grubby looking human and an even
smaller rodent-like creature join the first creature.
HUMAN
He doesn't like you.
SKYWALKER
I understood him.
HUMAN
I don't like you either.
SKYWALKER
I'm sorry.
The big creature is getting agitated and yells at the
general.
HUMAN
Don't insult us. You just watch
yourself. We're wanted men. I
have the death sentence on twelve
systems.
SKYWALKER
I'll be careful then.
HUMAN
You'll be dead.
The short rodent yells something and everything at the bar
moves away. The general assumes a defensive position. His
three adversaries ready their weapons.
SKYWALKER
You insist on a fight then?
HUMAN
Just try and kill us.
SKYWALKER
It will hurt a little.
HUMAN
We aren't cowards.
SKYWALKER
Then it can't be helped.
The general's lazersword sparks to life. An arm lies on the
floor. The rodent is cut in two and the large multiple-
"eyed creature lies doubled, cut from chin to groin. The"
general with quiet dignity replaces his sword in its sheath.
The entire fight has lasted only a matter of seconds. A
figure stands in the doorway watching the general. As soon
"as the general notices him, he leaves. The cantina goes back"
"to normal, as if nothing had happened, although the general"
is given a respectable amount of room at the bar. The Dai
finishes his drink and then leaves. Captain Oxus follows.
80. SPACEPORT ALLEYWAY - GORDON - TOWNOWI
"General Skywalker embraces Han Solo, the underground contact."
Han is a huge green skinned monster with no nose and large
gills.
HAN
You old stardog. Took a war to get
you out here...
"Oxus arrives with Captain Valor, the princess, and her"
"brothers, and the two puzzled androids."
SKYWALKER
It's been too long. We've been through
much together. It will be good to have
you out of retirement and back at my
side. How is General Valor? (putting
his arm around the young Captain Valor)
This is his son.
HAN
You're all the old boy will talk about.
"He's still holding up. Come, let's get"
off the street.
The group enters a small doorway at the far end of the alley-
"way. On the main street, within view of the doorway, giant"
royal airtanks and other military hardware rumble through
the city. Starving refugees sit in the gutter watching the
immense display of force with a mixture of awe and terror.
"The princess stops for a moment and stares at her people,"
watching the might of the kingdom. The general escorts her
through the doorway with the others.
81. SLUM DWELLING - LIVING AREA - TOWNOWI
The seedy dwelling is dark and dingy. The group is greeted
"by three underground leaders, and the old Dai, Akira Valor."
Justin embraces his father as the underground leaders bow
before the princess.
82. SLUM DWELLING - DINING AREA - TOWNOWI
"The princess walks through the dining area, followed by Oxus"
"and Valor, who carry the two sleeping princes. The general"
"sits at a large table finishing dinner with Han, Akira,"
and the three underground leaders. Oxus returns from the
bedroom.
SKYWALKER (to Oxus)
"Captain, why don't you take the"
androids into the other room for
a game of chess? I'm sure they'd
enjoy it.
C-3
A wonderful idea. Your kindness
is greatly appreciated.
"Oxus escorts the two robots into the next room. DATOS, a"
"thin wizened old man, seems greatly relieved."
DATOS
You're taking a great risk travelling
with them. This whole operation
sounds bad to me. I don't trust the
chrome companies. Time is growing
short. The King's attempts at control
have already caused a great deal of
suffering to our people.
"OCCO, a brash young rebel about the same age as Captain"
Valor slams his fist on the table.
OCCO
It must happen now! We are ready.
Each day the royal S.B.T. finds and
destroys a few more in the organiza-
tion. We cannot wait any longer.
SKYWALKER
Any uprising without a coordinated
attack on the death star is out of
the question.
HAN
He's right. As long as it's
"operational, any action down here"
would be meaningless. We must
proceed as planned. Are the
arrangements secure?
"QUIST, the third member of the underground, sparks to life"
and places several discs and badges on the table.
QUIST
All passenger transport has been
"suspended, so we've arranged for"
you to travel as the crew of a
Baltarian freighter. The boys
will have to be placed in suspended
animation and hidden in shielded
micropacks. It's the only way we
will be able to get them past the
scanners.
DATOS
Were you able to aquire the necessary
power packs?
QUIST
It's become a serious problem. All
power supplies have been restricted.
S-4 units are impossible to come by.
HAN
I know an agent who might be able to
acquire them for us. I'll check with
"him. It will be risky, but we've no"
other choice.
83. SPACEPORT OBSERVATION DECK - TOWNOWI
The dark figure of Dodona stands overlooking a group of
Townowi partisans who are being tortured in the plaza below.
Two royal officers are finishing a report to the evil legion-
"naire. They salute smartly, then leave the observation"
"balcony passing KURO, one of General Vader's aides, who"
approaches Dodona and bows low before him. Kuro and the
legionnaire carry on an animated conversation; it is
inaudible over the screams of the tortured partisans.
84. SLUM DWELLING - ALLEYWAY - TOWNOWI
Residents glance fearfully from their windows as six royal
stormtroopers make their way through the crowded slum alley-
way. Han Solo and Captain Valor move cautiously past the
royal patrol and disappear into the shabby hideout of the
partisan underground.
85. SLUM DWELLING - MAIN AREA - TOWNOWI
The two men enter the dingy main room of the slum dwelling
"and are immediately attacked by Oeta, wielding a toy sword."
"Valor good-naturedly fends off the young prince as Han, in"
"a more serious mood, goes into the other room. A-2 and C-3"
are helping Puck put together a block-like puzzle. Princess
"Zara comes in to see what all the commotion is about, just"
as the young captain grabs Oeta by the foot and holds him
upside-down. Valor and Oeta are laughing uproariously.
"Zara gives the captain a stern disapproving look, then"
returns to the other room.
86. SLUM DWELLING - DINING AREA - TOWNOWI
"General Skywalker, Captain Oxus, and Datos are in the process"
of assembling two micropacks on the kitchen table. Han pulls
"a small silver powerpack from his pocket, and places it on"
"the table. The old Dai, Akira Valor, reaches over with his"
one good arm and takes it. He inspects it carefully.
Princess Zara sits quietly behind the general.
HAN
We could only get one unit. Their
methods are proving to be very
effective.
Akira places the powerpack back on the table. The pain from
those simple movements shows on his face.
AKIRA
This will work fine.
HAN
One of the boys will have to stay.
DATOS
We can't hide him for very long.
The risk is too great. Which-
ever boy doesn't go must be des-
troyed.
"The princess is alarmed, and looks to the general for support."
He gives her an understanding look.
SKYWALKER
Not while they're in my charge.
Find another way to get him through.
DATOS
There's no other way. We've
analyzed every possible alter-
native. You can't jeopardize
the enitre...
Captain Valor enters the room.
HAN
We have no time for discussion.
The freighters leave at zero
three hundred. We must get
started.
"Through a break in the door, Oxus watches A-2 and C-3"
play with the two young princes.
OXUS
What about A-2? Could we loboto-
mize him and use his energy pack?
SKYWALKER
They're not compatible. We'd
have to completely change the
system.
HAN
It could work.
DATOS
There isn't enough time. You can't
do it.
AKIRA
You won't have to. My power unit
has more than half life. Use it.
The withered Dai opens his tunic revealing a metallic chest
covered with electrodes. With his one good arm he grabs
his chest and rips loose a miniature power unit similar to
the one on the table. Everyone is taken by surprise. The
general and the young Valor both rush to the side of the
dying Dai. The old man turns to his son.
AKIRA
"Trust my judgment, Son. Serve your"
new teacher well.
The Dai's breathing becomes more difficult as he turns to
the general.
AKIRA (Cont.)
"An honorable death, my friend."
May the force of others be with
you.
Akira Valor passes on to the other world. Everyone is
stunned. The general breaks the moment of silence.
SKYWALKER
May he be welcomed as a man above
men. Take him downstairs.
Justin takes his father in his arms and is followed out of
the room by Han and Datos.
SKYWALKER
Prepare the boys! We have little
time.
"Princess Zara and Captain Oxus rush out of the room, as the"
general places the power units in the micropacks.
87. SLUM DWELLING - MAIN AREA - TOWNOWI
Oeta and Puck are not happy about being dragged away from
their puzzle. Oxus takes the robots into the sleep area.
ZARA
"Now straighten up, Oeta. Remember,"
father expects you to follow his ways.
We are going on a trip. There will be
great danger. You must go to sleep.
"When you wake, you will be in a strange"
"land, so don't be alarmed."
OETA
Are you going to sleep too?
ZARA
I will be looking after you. Now
be good boys and stand still. Lift
your sleeve.
Puck lifts his sleeze and Zara injects him with a sleep
serum. Oxus enters just as the little prince collapses
"into a deep sleep. Quick as lightening, he catches the"
boy before he can hit the floor. The princess injects
her other brother and he collapses into her arms.
88. SLUM DWELLING - DINING AREA - TOWNOWI
The limp bodies of the two young princes are carried in
by Zara and Captain Oxus. They are carefully squeezed
into the hollowed out microcases. Zara pensively watches
as the general expertly attaches electrodes to her
brother's skull. Han and Datos return from the burial
of Akira. The general looks up from his operation.
HAN
He is at rest. Are the systems
working all right?
SKYWALKER
Full power. Is everything ready?
"Datos nods yes, as the general closes the case holding Puck."
The strain of watching her brothers placed in suspended
animation is too great for Zara and she retreats into the
main room.
89. SLUM DWELLING - MAIN ROOM - TOWNOWI
Captain Valor stands brooding near a window overlooking
the crowded alleyway. He does not acknowledge Zara's
entrance. She walks over to the window and stands next to
the young captain. They are very close but do not touch.
ZARA
I'm sorry.
He does not respond. She is moved by his sorrow and
starts to touch the side of his face but can't bring her-
self to do it. Her royal training is too strong to let her
show her true affection for Justin. She breaks down and
runs from the room. The young Dai continues his meditation.
90. SPACEPORT AT GORDON - SECURITY RAMP - TOWNOWI
The spaceport is very crowded. People rush about in a
panicked rush as loudspeakers blurt out indiscernible
announcements. The Royal Galactic Kingdom is in the process
of changing the boarding procedures and the result is chaos.
"Many flights are delayed, and people are running to and"
"fro, switching boarding ramps. Han guides the rebel group,"
"dressed as a Baltarian crew, through the crowded terminal."
Oxus and Valor carry the large micropacks strapped to their
backs. The robots follow a few paces behind.
HAN
They're changing the boarding
procedures. I don't like it.
They are swept into a boarding gate and finally reach a
security ramp scan station. There are a great number of
troops and guards standing around the security area. An
officer demands to see their passes and orders. The ten-
sion builds as the officer confers with an aide about the
passes. The aide speaks quietly into a phone.
OFFICER
Where are your component receipts?
"Valor and Oxus hand the officer two additional discs,"
"which are placed in the computer. A few moments later,"
the readout appears and the group is motioned through the
"electron scanners. On the other side of the scanner, new"
computer discs are issued to the group. The group seems
slightly relieved as they walk through several hallways
leading to where the freighter is docked. Valor moves
next to the general.
JUSTIN
I don't like the feel of this.
SKYWALKER
Your senses are strong. It's a
very small disruption.
JUSTIN
It's a Lettow legionnaire.
SKYWALKER
Possibly. Stay alert. Warn
the others.
The group walks through the docking links and into the
"Baltarian spacecraft. Several royal guards pass them,"
"and everyone is ready for the suspected trap, but"
nothing happens.
91. INTERIOR - BALTARIAN FREIGHTER - TOWNOWI
The group stops in a narrow electronic passageway near
the bridge of the ship. Valor and Oxus unstrap the
"micropacks containing the two young princes, and check"
the voltage packs.
OXUS
Little Oeta is losing power faster
than normal. I'd better check it
out.
SKYWALKER
Wait until the situation is secure.
"Stay here, and keep on your guard."
Han!
The two young captains grow suspicious of several workmen
gathering around the main exit hatch. Han and the general
enter the bridge area. Several crewmen sit at elaborate
controls and computer stations.
SKYWALKER
Where is your captain?
One of the crewmen directs him to a small chamber above the
bridge. Valor and Oxus strap on their micropacks as more
workmen converge at the main hatch and begin to close it.
"The two robots, A-2 and C-3 are confused about what is"
going on and wear their gear in anticipation of moving.
92. PILOT CHAMBER - BALTARIAN FREIGHTER - TOWNOWI
Han and the general enter the small pilot's chamber and
"greet the captain, whose face is hidden in the shadows of"
a computer bank.
CAPTAIN
"Welcome, gentlemen. You must"
have had a difficult journey.
We'll be departing shortly.
Four armed troopers silently enter the room behind the two
old Dai; their lazerswords are drawn.
CAPTAIN
I have been authorized to accept
payment for the chrome company
cooperation. I assume you've
brought it with you.
The captain moves out of the shadows and is revealed to
"be Dodona. Instantly, both Han and the general understand"
"the situation. They turn, drawing their lazerswords in"
the move and cut down the four royal troopers. The door
to the chamber instantly seals shut. Dodona hasn't made
any moves and remains unusually calm. The two Dai turn
to face him.
DODONA
"It's over, gentlemen. The chamber"
is sealed. Don?t force me to
release the Jai gas.
"A tone sounds, and Dodona turns to an intercom."
INTERCOM
Situation secure. Prisoners taken to
"hold ""B""; Twelve casualties... gas"
was necessary.
Han and the general relax and drop their weapons. The
door silently opens behind them and six guards enter wearing
facemasks. They bind the two Dai with chrome microcuffs. A
satisfied smile creeps across Dodona's face. General Sky-
walker seems unimpressed with the trap.
DODONA
"At last, it's ended. (to guard) Take"
"them to hold ""G."" I don't want them"
with the others. Prepare for departure.
The troopers escort Han and the general out of the chamber
and down several hallways.
93. INTERIOR - BALTARIAN FREIGHTERS - TOWNOWI
Eight troops march Han and the general into the hold of the
ship. They pass near the main exit where A-2 and C-3
"stand deserted, looking lost. C-3 sees the general pass in"
a nearby hallway
C-3
"Well, there he is. Come on."
The robots waddle off after the Dai prisoners. As the
small procession passes detention cell B where the princess
"and the others are being held, Han and the general let out"
"a horrifying Dai scream and leap to the corridor ceiling,"
thrusting their bound wrists into the lighting fixtures.
"They land on top of the troops, instantly breaking the"
"necks of four guards, with expertly placed blows. The"
eight surviving guards are momentarily dumbfounded. Han
and the general grab lazerswords from their victims and
swiftly cut down the remaining troops. Han grabs a small
card from one of the dead guards and starts for detention
cell B.
SKYWALKER
Watch it! Those are cutters.
The general grabs one of the dead troopers and tosses him
against the cell door. Red rays engulf the body and holds
it there. Han then places the card in a slot and the door
silently slides open. Valor and Oxus leap for the dead
"guard, then notice the death ray surrounding him. General"
Skywalker grabs another body and throws it into the doorway.
SKYWALKER
Pass between them!
Captain Valor squeezes between the slain guards and is
"untouched by the rays. Oxus and the princess quickly follow,"
picking up weapons as they leave.
JUSTIN
They've taken the cases.
SKYWALKER
Are they aware of the boys?
OXUS
I don't think so.
SKYWALKER
Find them. Use your seeker.
We'll meet you at the main
hatch. Watch yourselves. If
"an alarm is given, they'll gas"
the entire ship.
OXUS
"Yes, Sir."
Oxus and Valor each take a small humming device from their
"utility belts and head down a narrow hallway. The general,"
"Han, and the princess continue toward the main hatch. A-2"
and C-3 have been completely confused by the turn of events.
They eventually follow the general toward the exit hatch.
94. ELECTROCLOSET HALLWAY - BALTARIAN FREIGHTER - TOWNOWI
The two young captains reach a storage area of the huge
spacecraft. They watch their seekers as they move along a
row of electroclosets. They quietly sneak past a group of
workmen assembling a large gyrohousing. A second row of
micropacks is searched to no avail.
OXUS
"If they were discovered, they would"
have been sent to a medical station.
JUSTIN
There are more storage areas on the
far side.
95. MAIN HATCH AREA - BALTARIAN FREIGHTER - TOWNOWI
"Han and the general reach the main hatch, closely followed"
by Zara and the two robots. Several lights over the hatch
flash on and off. The general cuts a camera off the wall
with his lazersword.
HAN
They're going to take off. It's
too late.
SKYWALKER
"C-3, come over here!"
"The lanky chrome man approaches the general, who is studying"
a complex computer control panel next to the hatch.
C-3
Yes sir. May I be of service?
SKYWALKER
Get this hatch open. Counterlock
the departure pattern.
The robot immediately starts pushing buttons on the panel.
96. ELECTROCLOSET HALLWAY - BALTARIAN FREIGHTER - TOWNOWI
Captain Valor and Oxus reach a second series of electro-
closets. A signal appears on the seekers and Valor cuts
down the door of one of the small cabinets. Oxus stands
guard. Approaching troops are heard in the distance.
Valor quickly rummages through the electropacks until he
spots the familiar cases containing the two boys.
OXUS
Troops!
Valor straps on one of the backpacks and hands the other
"to Oxus, as they duck into a narrow passageway. Four"
troops march through a nearby hallway. After they have
"passed, the young captain checks to make sure the way is"
"clear, then runs down a hallway toward the main hatch."
97. BRIDGE - BALTARIAN FREIGHTER - TOWNOWI
"As the crew makes the final preparations for the blast off,"
the main hatch light blinks on. One of the pilots notices
the light and begins to check it out.
PILOT (into intercom)
Is the main hatch secure?
98. MAIN HATCH - BALTARIAN FREIGHTER - TOWNOWI
"The intercom sparks to life, and the general answers it."
SKYWALKER
"Everything looks secure, but give"
me a minute to check it out.
PILOT
All right. Stand by.
"The general winks to Han, as C-3 continues his attempt to"
override the hatch computer.
99. HALLWAYS - BALTARIAN FREIGHTER - TOWNOWI
"Captain Valor and Oxus cautiously move down a long hallway,"
"ever watchful of royal troops. They reach an intersection,"
"carefully check in all directions, then rush down a main"
"hallway. They are about half-way down the hallway, when a"
squad of royal guards appears at the end of the hallway
"facing them. The troops start toward the two captains, with"
lowered lazerrifles.
VALOR
Here's where it gets tricky.
"Valor, then Oxus, quickly and smoothly draw their lazer-"
pistols and fire at the troops. A giant explosion destroys
"the far end of the hallway. A few lazerbolts are returned,"
but streak harmlessly overhead and explode out of range.
The exchange of gunfire lasts only a few moments. When the
"smoke clears, the troops have been destroyed."
100. MAIN HATCH - BALTARIAN FREIGHTER - TOWNOWI
"The main hatch slowly begins to slide open, when the"
rumbling explosion of lazerfire echoes through the hallways.
Han looks to the general and they both instantly realize
what has happened. Han draws his weapons. The hatch is
now fully open. Everyone stands silently watching for the
"two captains. Alarms start screaming throughout the ship,"
and the giant hatch slowly begins to close.
SKYWALKER
Come on. We can't wait.
"The group reluctantly exit the spacecraft, giving one last"
look back to their lost friends. The hatch continues to
"slowly close, as the alarm sirens wail. Suddenly, Valor"
and Oxus round a corner and head for the ever-closing
"hatch, battling several royal troopers as they go. Han and"
the general move up to the hatch and give cover fire. Oxus
"slips through the shrinking opening, and yells to Valor to"
hurry. Many more troops bear down on the young Dai as he
squeezes through the very slim opening. One of the troops
dives after him but is caught and crushed by the emergency
hatch.
101. BOARDING RAMPS - GORDON SPACEPORT - TOWNOWI
The general leads the group through various corridors.
HAN
"Once the alarm sounds, the entire"
spaceport will shut down.
"They stop at a junction. At the far end of one hallway,"
several troops guard a restricted passageway.
SKYWALKER
That's the military section.
JUSTIN
Fighter craft!
HAN
But it's very heavily guarded.
We can't take it with subtlety.
"Before the general can answer, the acute scream of the"
spaceport alarm reverberates through the corridors. The
"general, followed by his two young captains, charge toward"
"the heavily guarded military passageway. Han, with the"
"princess and two robots, follow at a safe distance behind."
A guard sees them coming and orders them to stop. Captain
Valor and the general fire their lazerpistols and the
passageway entrance and the troops disappear in a huge
explosion.
"The group jump over the dead guards and smoking rubble, then"
run through a series of hallways leading to a starship.
They stop just short of an intersection leading to a boarding
ramp. Valor peeks around a corner at two guards standing in
front of the boarding ramp.
JUSTIN
Cutters! We'll have to draw them
out. A blast might alert the crew.
SKYWALKER
"A-2, Come here."
The little robot waddles over to the old Dai.
SKYWALKER
Move to that intersection and sound the
alarm.
The mechanical dwarf dutifully marches into the intersection
"and lets out a high, electronic scream. The guards shut off"
"the deadly lazer cutters, and cautiously approach the wailing"
robot.
GUARD
What is it? What's wrong?
"With incredible speed, both guards are dropped by a few"
precision blows from the two young captains. They immediately
drag the unconscious guards into the starship.
SKYWALKER
Valor! Oxus! Stand guard. I'll
signal at take-off minus thirty.
And reverse that cutter!
102. INTERIOR - ROYAL STARSHIP - TOWNOWI
"Han and the general, followed by Zara and the robots, enter"
the royal starship. They rush through several narrow hall-
ways leading to the bridge. Two crew members leaving a con-
trol station stumble into the group and are quickly dis-
patched by Han. The princess waits with the robots as the
general and Han enter the bridge. The two pilots and
navigator are taken by surprise and are promptly subdued.
Han switches on the intercom and listens.
HAN
How are we going to get them to
open the silo cover?
SKYWALKER
Send C-3 in here. Dispose of any
crewmen left on board.
103. BOARDING RAMP - SPACEPORT - TOWNOWI
Valor and Oxus now wear the uniform of the royal guard.
Oxus has removed a plate from the cutter machinism and is
crossing a few wires. He replaces the cutter plate just as a
squad of stormtroopers rushes toward the door. An officer
salutes them.
OFFICER
Have you seen them?
JUSTIN
"No, Sir."
OFFICER
They're in this section somewhere.
I'm doubling all the guards. Stay
alert.
"Two guards take up positions just outside the cutter areas,"
and the squad moves on to another starship. Valor gives
his partner a philosophical look.
104. INTERIOR - ROYAL STARSHIP - TOWNOWI
The gleaming chrome C-3 sits in the pilot's seat talking
on the intercom to a controller. He breaks off his continual
drone of take-off instructions to the controller and turns
"to the general, shaking his head."
C-3
They won't buy it. I think they're
getting suspicious.
Han enters.
HAN
The crew is taken care of.
SKYWALKER
"Well, they're not going to open"
"the silo cover, so I'm afraid we'll"
have to take it with us.
HAN
We're going to sustain considerable
damage if we blast off through that
cover.
SKYWALKER
It's a thin shell. There is no
choice. (to C-3) Signal the boys.
105. BOARDING RAMPS - SPACEPORT - TOWNOWI
Warning lights flash and the main hatch to the starfighter
slowly begins to close. The two royal stormtroopers yell
at Valor and Oxus.
STORMTROOPERS
Watch it! Don't fire into those
cutters! (to Valor) Shut down
the cutters!
The two captains pretend to be confused and not understand.
At the last minute they leap aboard the starship. The hatch
slides closed and the boarding ramp drops away. Several
"more guards arrive and give the troopers a special card,"
which turns the small cutter warning lights from red to green.
The guards rush on to the boarding ramp and are wiped out by
the reversed cutters.
106. INTERIOR - STARSHIPS - TOWNOWI
They strap themselves into lifepods. C-3 and the general
"move forward, and the giant ship shudders as it starts to"
"lift off the launch pad. With tense expressions, they all"
brace for the impact of the silo cover.
107. STARSHIP - SPACEPORT SILO - TOWNOWI
"The mighty starship thunders out of the silo, crashing"
"through the cover plate, sending shrapnel in all directions."
The ship leaps toward the heavens.
108. BOARDING CAMPS - SPACEPORT - TOWNOWI
Royal flight crews rush to their starships. Pilots receive
their clearances and several giant silo covers swing away
revealing deadly hunter-destroyer spaceships.
109. INTERIOR - BRIDGE - STARSHIP - SPACE
Han and the general watch as five hunter-destroyers leave the
spaceport at Gordon.
SKYWALKER
We suffered light damage to a deflector
fin. It will take them quite a while
to catch up with us now. Tell the boys
to get some rest.
110. AFT SECTION - STARSHIP - SPACE
"Han retreats to the aft section of the ship, where the two"
captains are checking out the two main lazercannons mounted
in large rotating bubble turrets.
HAN
The old boy says you two should get
some rest. You've got some time
before they catch up to us.
Han notices the packs containing the young princes.
HAN (Cont.)
Better store the boys in a lifepod.
Secure them well.
"He heads back toward the bridge, followed by Oxus. Valor"
carries the two mircropacks to a lifepod and straps them in.
He checks Oeta's energy supply. It is low. Zara approaches
him.
ZARA
Couldn't we let them out now?
JUSTIN
It's better this way. Things are
going to get rough.
ZARA
Will we make it? Is there any
hope? Stay with me. I love you.
Captain Valor is slightly shocked at this outburst. The
princess starts to cry and clings to him for support.
JUSTIN
"No-one is going to die, so stop acting"
like a child and start behaving like a
queen. What is this silly talk of love?
You belong to the people of Townowi and
"my job is to return you to them, nothing"
more. Now straighten up and get into a
lifepod.
She's deeply hurt by his callousness. She breaks away from
him and runs down a hallway into a lifepod. He is tired
and angry at the whole incident.
111. BRIDGE - STARSHIP - SPACE
C-3 guides the starship toward the Ophuchi system. The
general watches the computer readout estimate the position
of the royal hunter destroyers.
C-3
Hostile craft will intercept at
thirty plus.
112. AFT SECTION - STARSHIP - SPACE
Captain Valor rests in one of the lazercannon pod bays. He
"is thinking about Zara. Slowly, a smile creeps across his"
"face. He makes a decision, jumps up and hurries down a"
hallway. He taps on the lifepod bulkhead and Oxus opens
the door. Valor is surprised.
OXUS
What is it?
JUSTIN
Where is Zara?
OXUS
She went forward. What's going
on with you two?
JUSTIN
I love her.
OXUS
You're asking for trouble. She's a queen.
Do you know what you're saying?
JUSTIN
I don't care. I've got to talk ...
"Oxus just shakes his head, but before Valor can finish his"
"sentence, the ship is rocked by a bombardment of proton"
torpedoes. The intercom squawks to life.
SKYWALKER (over intercom)
Get to those guns!
Captain Valor and Oxus rush to the lzercannons and jump into
the protective suits and helmets.
113. BRIDGE - STARSHIP - SPACE
Han enters the bridge and sits before a fire control center.
"The general sits in a chair slightly behind and above C-3,"
directing the robot pilot.
SKYWALKER
Turn around! Let's face them.
"A-2, sitting quietly in a corner, watches as C-3 punches"
new information into the computer and the giant starship
swings around in a sharp circle. Several torpedoes explode
near the ship. The general switches on the intercom.
SKYWALKER
You boys ready?
114. AFT SECTION - STARSHIP - SPACE
The captains adjust the lazercannon controls in front of
them and check in with the general.
SKYWALKER
They should be within range in
twelve seconds...
"Captain Valor adjusts his giant lazer ack-ack cannon,"
searching his electronic tracking screen for the hunter
destroyer. Oxus is having a problem with one of the
"rotating mechanisms on the huge gun. He curses, climbs"
"out of the chair, and attempts to fix it."
OXUS
My vertical rotating circuits are
out.
The princess straps herself into a small lifepod. Only the
slightest hint of concern or worry shows in her face. She
listens to her protectors relay instructions as the enemy
approach.
115. BRIDGE - STARSHIP - SPACE
The starship shudders as the hunter destroyers open fire.
Han relays the ship's status to the general as C-3 struggles
to keep up with the barrage of orders.
HAN
We're losing deflectors three
thirty-one and ten forty-two.
SKYWALKER (to C-3)
Cut hard to maridian nine zero
six. Level to three degrees.
(into the intercom) We're
coming under one. Wait for my
signal.
116. AFT SECTION - STARSHIP - SPACE
The constant flashing of deflected lazer bolts reflect in
the interior of the lazercannon bubble. Captain Valor
rechecks his firing swithces. Oxus adjusts his headphones
and lowers a glare reflector. He raps on the power rotation
circuits and gives them a little test burst. The pod
instantly rotates a few degrees. The large starship heads
directly toward the three enemy ships and at the last moment
dives under the attacking craft. Valor watches the smaller
"crafts pass overhead, aching to open fire. He calls Oxus on"
the intercom.
JUSTIN
I've got no signal. I'm on
target. What's wrong? What
is he waiting for? I've got
an open shield.
The three royal craft are firing incessantly at point blank
range.
OXUS
Wait for the signal.
But Captain Valor has a perfect shot and he can't wait. He
"squeezes the trigger and the giant lazercannon, with a burst"
"of smoke and electrical charge, opens up on the enemy craft."
"Moments later, the signal lights flash on and Oxus commences"
firing on the receding hunter-destroyers. Two of the royal
"craft break off, and prepare for another attack run. The"
third is hit by a concentrated barrage from the two captains
and begins spinning out of control until it finally explodes.
"Oxus gives the victory wave, which Justin gleefully returns."
These moments of triumph are broken by the intercom.
SKYWALKER
"Captain Valor, next run you wait for"
my signal. We haven't much power to
spare on your inaccurate grandstanding!
Justin's pride is wounded. He resets his accelerators as
the two remaining hunter-destroyers begin a second run.
117. BRIDGE - STARSHIP - SPACE
Han turns to the general.
HAN
We have a weakened shield on the
port turret...
SKYWALKER
Warn Captain Valor. Get him out of
there. (to C-3) Change your
heading by point five.
118. AFT SECTION - STARSHIP - SPACE
Princess Zara listens to Han warn Valor.
HAN
Your shield power is down. Abandon
that position and seal that section.
"Report! Captain, do you hear me?"
Captain?!!!
Zara becomes worried that something has happened to Justin.
The young captain switches off the intercom system and
signals to Oxus that the system has gone dead. Before Oxus
"can answer, the two hunter-destroyer spacecraft are upon"
them once again. Lazer bolts flash all around them. The
"general's signal flashes on, and the captain starts to"
return the fire. One of the royal fighters concentrates
its fire on Valor's weakened gunport. A direct hit blows
open a hole in the turret and everything that isn't bolted
"down is sucked into outer space, including Captain Valor."
"He bangs against the side of the starship, held only by a"
weakened lifeline.
The princess hears Oxus explain Valor's predicament and
rushes back to help him. She is stopped by a pressure
locked door leading to the gun emplacement.
119. BRIDGE - STARSHIP - SPACE
The general orders C-3 to swing the spacecraft around and
start a new attack. He turns to A-2.
SKYWALKER
Use the aft port. See what you can
do for Valor.
A-2 hurriedly waddles out of the bridge. C-3 and Han
simultaneously turn to the general.
C-3
More craft approaching!
HAN
It looks like at least six or seven.
The general studies the radar scopes and then checks a
galactic map displayed on one of the monitors.
SKYWALKER
Change course to three point one.
C-3
That will head us directly into
the path of the Norton Asteroid
Belt.
HAN
That asteroid belt is too dense
to pass through. The ship won't
make it!
SKYWALKER
We'll never defeat them in combat.
It's our only chance to lose them.
C-3 punches in new coordinates and the starship veers away
toward the treacherous asteroid belt.
120. AFT SECTION - STARSHIP - SPACE
Oxus fires on one of the two hunter-destroyers which is
pacing the rebel starship. Captain Valor unsuccessfully
tries to pull himself back inside the spacecraft. The enemy
craft maneuvers wildly in an attempt to get into a better
position to fire on Valor. Oxus blasts away until the royal
"spacecraft spews forth equipment and personnel, careens off,"
and eventually explodes.
A-2 wobbles along the exterior of the ship until he reaches
the stranded captain. He attaches a new lifeline to the
young Dai's spacesuit and makes his way back inside the
wounded craft. Valor is pulled to safety just as the star-
ship enters the asteroid belt. A barrage of small and large
"asteroids begins to pelt the ship, causing a great deal of"
damage.
SKYWALKER (over intercom)
Secure yourselves. We may have to
eject. Abandon the turrets.
The princess rushes back to her lifepod and straps herself
in. Oxus and A-2 help Valor make his way out of the lazer-
"cannon turrets and through a series of locks, to the life-"
pod area.
121. BRIDGE - STARSHIP - SPACE
The asteroids hit hard. The ship is buffeted to and fro as
"the general, Han, and C-3 struggle into their spacesuit-"
like lifepods. The royal hunter-destroyer closest to the
rebel ship explodes in the on-rush of deadly asteroids.
The new reinforcement hunter-destroyers turn back and give
up the pursuit. They disappear from the tracking monitors.
The asteroid bombardment becomes almost unbearable. Warning
"lights begin to flash. Extending foils, antennae, and arma-"
ment pods are scraped away from the starship hull. A base-
"ball sized hole is punched through the midsection, and"
hundreds of objects are sucked into space. A large locker
eventually plugs the opening. The starship and her passengers
shudder and sway under the punishment of the asteroid storm.
C-3
The ship is breaking up.
HAN
We're almost clear of the storm.
C-3
We'll never make it. Eject. We
must eject.
The general watches the computer monitor as the starship
emerges from the far side of the asteroid belt.
HAN
We're approaching one of the
Forbidden Systems.
SKYWALKER
We've got to achieve orbit.
C-3
We'll never make it.
The starship heads for a small blue-green planet in the
distance.
122. AFT SECTION - STARSHIP - SPACE
Captain Valor was considerably shaken in the destruction of
his lazerturret. He is slightly dazed as Oxus straps him
into a lifepod with A-2.
OXUS (to A-2)
You watch him. Make sure this
pod gets off all right.
A-2 nods and Oxus moves to the second lifepod and straps
himself in next to the princess.
ZARA
Will he be all right?
OXUS
I think so. His feelings for
you are dangerous. You should
discourage him.
She is surprised that Valor has any feeling for her but
keeps her emotions to herself.
123. BRIDGE - STARSHIP - YAVIN ORBIT
The general is strapped into the lifepod with the two
micropacks containing the young princes. Han and C-3 are
in the second lifepod.
HAN
We're in orbit.
C-3
We've got to eject now! Those reactors
won't hold much longer. This ship's
going to end up in a million little
pieces and I don't want to be one of
them.
HAN
All lifepod systems are operative.
SKYWALKER (into intercom)
"If you boys are ready back there,"
we'll get off this bucket.
OXUS
All systems operative. I
have the signal.
A-2
All systems operative. We
have the signal.
Han salutes the general and his lifepod jettisons away
from the crippled starship. He is quickly followed by
the general.
124. AFT SECTION - STARSHIP - YAVIN ORBIT
A-2 pushes the jettison switch but nothing happens. Cap-
tain Valor slowly and with some difficulty pushes the
switch two or three times. Nothing happens. He begins to
look a little worried.
A-2 (into intercom)
We've got a problem. Wait a
second.
A-2 pushes the switch again and the lifepod blasts off in
a cloud of smoke and debris. Oxus also seems to be having
a problem. Half the lights on his control panel have gone
dead. He struggles to reactivate them.
OXUS
My power's out!
SKYWALKER (over intercom)
Is it a faulty switch?
OXUS
No. The whole bank is out.
"Oxus gives the princess a reassuring look, then punches some"
"information into the computer. The monitor flashes: ""Income"
"line main power."" He looks outside the lifepod and sees a"
damaged cable.
OXUS
I've found it.
SKYWALKER
You haven't much time. The
auxiliary units have already
blown.
Oxus scrambles out of the lifepod and rushes over to the
"severed connector. He works on it for a few moments, then"
stops with a rather defeated look. The princess watches
him as he tries to think of a solution. A great explosion
is heard in the forward part of the ship.
125. LIFEPODS - SPACE - YAVIN ORBIT
"The two lifepods containing the general, Han and C-3 drift"
away from the disabled starship.
SKYWALKER
Where's Captain Valor?
HAN
I can't see him either.
Captain Valor uses the small rockets on his lifepod to
maneuver back toward the burning starship. He can hear the
general over the intercom.
SKYWALKER
"Captain Valor, where are you?"
Report in.
Valor reaches down and switches off the intercom.
126. AFT SECTION - STARSHIP - YAVIN ORBIT
Oxus appears to have found a solution to his situation and
rushes back to the princess. He reaches in and locks on the
power switch.
OXUS
There is only one possible solution
and we must use it. Lock the hitch
and make sure it is sealed.
PRINCESS
But what of...?
Another explosion creates a large bulge in the wall of the
aft section.
OXUS
We've no time!
He slams the hatch shut and runs to the power connector.
"Smoke begins to fill the chamber, as Oxus slams a large"
metallic dampening tool across the damaged connector ter-
"minals, and the lifepod jettisons away."
127. LIFEPODS - SPACE - YAVIN ORBIT
"The princess jettisons free, as Captain Valor moves toward"
the crippled ship. Zara calls the general on the intercom.
ZARA
"I'm all right, but Clieg is"
still on board.
SKYWALKER
"Captain Valor, stay out of"
there.
"With a rumble, the starship disappears in a spectacular"
"explosion, sending debris in all directions. Valor stops"
his lifepod and it starts to drift. He is weeping. Han
and the general watch the remains of the explosion drift
away.
SKYWALKER
"Captain Valor, stay near Zara."
Use your beacon. Coordinate
with us.
Valor's intercom is weak and there is a great deal of static.
The lifepods drift toward the awesome blue-green Yavin
surface. The general loses sight of the other lifepods as
they descend through the cloud cover.
SKYWALKER
"Captain, I'm losing your beacon."
Send me a new signal.
All he gets is static. The planet surface rushes toward the
falling lifepods. Retrorockets automatically kick in and
slow the pods. Two of the small craft break through the
"brown clouds and land in the dense, steaming jungles. The"
sky is a strange light brown color.
128. VINE JUNGLE - YAVIN
The general's lifepod crashes through the foliage until it
comes to rest in the middle of a large vine-covered tree.
He grabs the two micropacks and climbs out of the lifepod
and onto a large moss-covered limb. Han and C-3 run to the
base of the huge tree.
HAN
Are you all right?
SKYWALKER
Fine. Any signal from Captain
Valor?
HAN
Nothing yet. I think they landed
further south.
The general attaches a thin cable from his utility belt to
the tree trunk and slides to the ground. Han takes the
micropacks from him. The general looks around at the jungle.
SKYWALKER
This is dangerous country. We'd better
stay together.
C-3
The wildlife in the Forbidden System
is extremely hostile. Perhaps we
should seek shelter?
Han inspects the power units of the micropacks.
HAN
Puck's unit is very low. I can't
tell if the unit is still functioning.
SKYWALKER
We have to find a place to revive
them. We'll start moving south. We
should find protection along that
ridge.
The general grabs one of the micropacks and starts off into
the murky jungle. Han and C-3 quickly follow. The jungle
is a strange and eerie fog-laiden purgatory. Gruesome and
unnatural sounds permeate this ghostly wasteland. Everyone
is cautious and on the alert for an unseen danger.
129. FOREST OF THE GARGANTUANS - YAVIN
Captain Valor's lifepod is also caught in the limbs of a
gargantuan tree. The lifepod has been ripped in half by the
crash landing. The unconscious Dai hangs half out of the
damaged craft. A two-foot high insect-like creature scoots
down a branch and onto the back of the dormant warrior. The
insect lets out a chilling hissing sound and a slimy tube
"emerges from its hairy mouth, waking Valor. He is immediately"
aware of the insect. His eyes are open but he doesn't move.
Suddenly with one quick blow he knocks the creature against
the side of the spacecraft and it is squashed lifeless.
Captain Valor is a little groggy but he manages to climb
out of the wreckage. He looks around for A-2.
JUSTIN
A-2! A-2!
A-2
Help!
"Valor turns and sees the little robot hanging upside down, one"
of his three feet caught in a vine. He lifts A-2 out of his
predicament and places him securely on a wide limb.
JUSTIN
Did you see Zara?
A-2
She landed on the other side of those
"trees, approximately eight hundred"
meters.
JUSTIN
"Well, come on, old buddy. Let's get"
ourselves out of this tree.
130. VINE JUNGLE RIDGE - YAVIN
"The general, Han, and C-3 reach a shallow cave near the top"
of a steep ridge. They quickly pull off the micropacks and
place them on a clear piece of ground at the mouth of the
cave.
SKYWALKER (to Han)
"Check out the inside. C-3, stand"
guard. Keep you eye on the country-
side.
He looks at the power units on the micropacks and shakes his
head with a worried look. Han returns from a survey of the
inside of the cave.
HAN
It doesn't go very far. There's
nothing back there.
SKYWALKER
Help me with this.
Han helps the general lift the top from the case containing
"Puck, the younger of the two princes. The small boy appears"
lifeless as the general pulls him from his encasement and
rests him on the cave floor. Han pulls a small respirator
out of the micropacks and places it over the boy's nose. The
general attaches two electrodes over his heart.
HAN
He doesn't look good.
The little prince begins to turn blue. The general grows
tense. Puck starts to regain consciousness but begins
"coughing and choking, then goes limp again. The general"
quickly props Puck's mouth open with a small plastic rod and
checks the reading on his powerpack.
SKYWALKER
We need more power. Tap off Oeta's
unit. Quickly!
He then places Puck's arms behind his back and starts pressing
"on his chest with sharp, rhythmic movements. Han attaches"
"new electrodes to the boy's heart. Puck again comes to,"
"choking and coughing. Finally, he begins to cry. The general"
takes the plastic tube from Puck's mouth and tenderly pats
him on the back.
SKYWALKER
Let's get Oeta out of there. He
shouldn't be a problem.
131. FOREST OF THE GARGANTUANS - YAVIN
Valor slams closed the hatch of Princess Zara's lifepod.
In the distance the subhuman cries of lonesome tree beasts
cut through the forest murmur.
A-2
Perhaps she went in search of
us.
Valor studies the ground around the capsule. There are a
great many footprints and much broken foliage.
JUSTIN
Someone's got her. She put up
quite a fight. It's an easy
trail to follow.
132. VINE JUNGLE RIDGE - YAVIN
Both Oeta and Puck are sleeping restlessly on the floor of
the cave. Han watches over them as the general scans the
valley below with a pair of electrobinoculars.
C-3
It's about fourteen degrees below
the horizon...a little to the left.
The electrobinoculars sweep the rich green landscape until
they come to rest on a bright reflection revealing some
type of structure.
SKYWALKER
It's too small to be a military
base. Could belong to a trapper.
C-3
Highly unusual.
SKYWALKER
It's on the way. Perhaps we
should investigate.
Little Oeta wakes up with a giant yawn.
OETA
Hey! Where are we?
133. FOREST OF THE GARGANTUANS - YAVIN
"The gargantuan trees are shrouded in mist, and the ominous"
sounds of unearthly creatures fill the air. Captain Valor
"moves quietly and cautiously, followed by A-2, who"
inadvertently makes a loud clicking sound. The young
warrior stops and motions to the stubby little robot.
JUSTIN
Wait here. If I don't return by
"zero two hundred, come looking"
for me.
The mechanical dwarf acknowledges with his computer light.
"Valor moves swiftly and silently forward, until he hears"
laughing and voices. He climbs up the bankside of a huge
tree and inches his way out onto one of the huge overhanging
branches. Below him he can see a group of scruffy alien
"trappers sitting around a nutron stove, joking and telling"
"stories. Parked on either side of the group are two large,"
"tank-like jungle-crawlers. Behind the crawlers, five Jawa's"
(huge gray and furry beasts) hang upside down in a tree.
Occasionally they thrash about in great anger and frustration.
"The trappers speak in a strange language, and although they"
"appear slightly human, they are slimy, deformed, hideous"
looking creatures. Two of the trappers yell at each other
in a friendly argument. One shirtless creature goes into a
crawler and the remaining eight laugh hysterically. Captain
Valor moves further out on the limb to get a better view. A
"couple of pieces of bark break loose, and float a hundred"
feet to the ground. The trappers fail to notice. Moments
"later, the shirtless trapper emerges from the crawler with"
the princess held unconscious and half naked over his head.
"Valor's rage knows no bounds. With a terrifying Dai war cry,"
"the young captain jumps from the tree, sails over a hundred"
"feet, and with great agility, lands in the middle of the"
"startled trappers. In one continuous rapid motion, he ignites"
his lazersword and cuts down three of the vile creatures. The
shirtless trapper swings the princess over his shoulder and
runs back into the huge jungle crawler. Two other trappers
"reach for their pistols, but the Dai has killed them before"
their weapons can clear leather. The three remaining
creatures have their pistols out and start firing. Explosions
erupt all around Valor. One blast hits the branch holding
the Jawa's and they collapse with a loud screech in a heap.
One of the trappers is caught in the crossfire and is blown
apart.
When the smoke clears Valor lies unconscious amid the
burning rubble. The jungle crawler begins to move out of the
camp. The last two trappers run after it. One is able to
"jump on board, but the second trapper runs too close to the"
"now freed Jawas. Boma, one of the furry giants, grabs him"
"and snaps him in two, like a stick of wood. The jungle"
"crawler disappears in the forest mist. The eight foot Boma,"
"who resembles a huge, gray bushbaby with fierce baboon-like"
"fangs, struggles to free his companions."
"Valor regains semi-consciousness, and attempts to get up, only"
to groan and collapse back into unconsciousness. The Jawas
gather around him and poke him a couple of times to see if
"he is still alive. They squawk and jabber, apparently in"
"some kind of argument. Finally, Wann, the largest of the Jawas"
picks up Valor and puts him over his shoulder. The group
disappears into the jungle foliage.
134. TREE HOUSE - FOREST OF THE GARGANTUANS - YAVIN
Han and C-3 carry the two little boys on their shoulders.
The general stops on the edge of a clearing and motions for
the others to be still. Oeta turns around and signals his
little brother to be quiet. On the opposite side of the
"clearing, a small metal structure is attaached to one of the"
"huge trees. It is a small, weatherbeaten hut of futuristic"
design. It appears deserted. The general cautiously
approaches the structure.
VOICE
Howdy stranger. What can I offer you?
"The general spins around and sees Huu Tho, an aged and scruffy"
looking anthropologist.
THO (Cont.)
I'm Huu Tho of Bastine.
The general takes the old man's extended hand.
SKYWALKER
I'm Luke Skywalker of Townowi.
He signals for the others to join him in the clearing.
135. WOOKEE CAMP - YAVIN
"The small caravan of Jawas, led by Boma, enters a small"
clearing surrounded by many bark and mud hovels. Young
"Jawas race ahead of the group, yelling and running in and"
"out of the grubby little dwellings. Giant, bushbaby-like"
Jawas of all ages and sizes make their way into the clearing.
"Many stand dumbfounded, but others let out a joyful scream"
"and rush up to members of the group, hugging and kissing them."
Wann dumps the unconscious captain on a raised area in the
middle of the clearing. Armed Jawas immediately surround the
helpless human. Boma enters the largest of the lodges. He
"is greeted by his father, Auzituck, chief of the Kaapauku"
tribe. He is an old and feeble Jawa dressed in royal skins
and headdress.
136. INTERIOR - ANTHROPOLOGIST HUT - YAVIN
"Anthropologist Tho, the general, Han and the children sit"
around a large table eating. Tho yells into the kitchen.
THO
Beru! Where's the thanta sauce?
"BERU THO, Kuu's warm plump wife, enters carrying a small"
pitcher. She smiles at Kuu.
BERU
I swan! I put it right here in
front so you'd see it. (to Han)
Here's some bum bum extract.
It's very mild.
THO (to general)
There are no settlers to the south
since the Dau family was wiped out.
I'm afraid I couldn't even get in
there to bury them. Those Jawas
are the fiercest critters I've ever
run across. A new tribe moved in
down there about a year ago and
it's been hell ever since. Only
Yourellian trappers venture in
there now and many of them don't
even come back.
SKYWALKER
Where's the nearest city?
THO
"No cities at all, only a few"
scattered settlers and -- one
royal outpost. But the troops
are of no help. They kill and
plunder rather than protect.
Enough. If your friends landed
"farther south, I'd fear for them."
HAN
How far is the outpost from here?
THO
Five leagues...an oppressive
blight.
SKYWALKER
What class is it? How many
support craft?
THO
"It's very small, a class two."
"Only ten or twelve starraiders,"
I think.
"Beru fusses over the boys, who refuse to eat their vegetables."
She makes up a game which tricks them into eating. The
general ponders the situation. Han eats like he hasn't eaten
in years.
137. JAWA CAMP - YAVIN
Captain Valor is surrounded by Jawas. Young ones push through
"to get a better look, as the adults jabber and argue about the"
"human. Valor regains consciousness with a groan, and a sudden"
"hush sweeps over the gathering. Valor staggers to his feet,"
and the group of Jawas back away en masse. The young dai
surveys the situation for a few moments. The Jawas appear
to be frightened of this brave warrior. He reaches for his
weapons but they are gone. Three guards with long spears
"attempt to contain Valor. With a loud shout, he lunges at"
"them and they give him a little room. Jommillia, a large"
"ferocious Jawa, steps forward. He says something to the"
guards and they quickly move away. He struts before Captain
"Valor, boasting and taunting him with his spear and battle"
ax. The captain studies the Jawa warrior as he paces back
"and forth, his helmet plumes dancing and chest armor jangling."
"Without warning, Valor lets out another loud yell, startling"
Jommillia into backing off. Captain Valor continues his
"verbal assault, calling the uncomprehending Jawa all manner"
of vile and degrading things. Jommillia continues to back
"into the surrounding crowd, momentarily confused by this odd"
"behaviour. Slowly, Jommillia begins to grin. He takes a"
"defensive stance, then begins to laugh hysterically. This"
stops Valor. The giant Jawa swings his deadly double-bladed
battle ax over his head and expertly throws it directly at
the young captain's head. To the amazement of Jommillia and
"the other Jawas, Captain Valor, with Dai Nogas skill and"
"concentration, catches the ax in mid-air, then charges his"
furry opponent.
"Jommillia is caught off-guard, but manages to block Valor's"
attack with his spear. The two warriors engage in a savage
"and fantastic duel. Valor cuts the Jawas spear in half, but"
is hit along the side of the head by the shaft and is momentaril
dazed. The battle ax is knocked from his hands. He grabs the
spear shaft and rams the giant creature in the belly. A loud
command from outside the crowd stops the fight. The Jawas
"part, revealing Boma and his father, who approach the two"
"warriors. Jommillia bows before his chief, and is commanded"
to move away. Boma speaks to Valor. The captain doesn't
"understand, but welcomes the chance to catch his breath."
"Boma then presents his father, who steps forward and bows"
before the mighty Dai. Boma bows also as the crowd of Jawas
"chatter in disbelief. When the chief and his son rise, Valor"
bows before them. This pleases the Jawas and they screech
and cheer.
138. TREE HOUSE - FOREST OF THE GARGANTUANS - YAVIN
Mr. and Mrs. Tho stand on the balcony of their tree house
"with C-3 and the two little princes, Oeta and Puck. Han and"
the general emerge with large survival backpacks and multi-
plelazer weapons.
SKYWALKER (to C-3)
We'll call for you when we've found them.
C-3
Your orders are quite clear. The
boys will be quite safe.
THO
Don't worry. The patrols never
come out this far. We'll take good
care of the boys.
SKYWALKER
Your kindness will surely be
rewarded.
THO
Just be careful out there.
He pats Skywalker on the back as the old Dai and the ever
faithful Han descend from the tree house. At the base of
"the huge tree, the warriors climb aboard two small rocket"
powered platforms.
THO (yelling down to them)
They're pretty old. I hope they'll
be all right!
SKYWALKER
Out here they're a wonderment.
C-3 and the kids wave as the jelsticks start with a whine.
They idle about five feet above the ground.
THO
Good hunting! May the force of
others be with you.
Han and the general wave as they ride off into the foreboding
Yavin sunset.
139. JAWA CAMP - YAVIN - NIGHT
A beautiful but frenzied fire festival is underway. Jawas
"perform the Waita Tar dance, and yodel in a barking fashion"
"around a large fire. The female Jawas arrive, carrying"
torches and move in a circle around the males. The giant
creatures are too involved to notice little A-2 make his way
around the dancers. The stubby robot stops near one of the
mud huts and looks around. He then wobbles off toward the
large chief's quarters and enters.
- Dissolve -
140. JAWA CAMP - YAVIN - MORNING
A-2 exits the chief's hut and looks around. It is a quiet
gray morning. A low mist hangs over the now deserted
clearing. He turns and signals back into the hut. Captain
Valor cautiously emerges from the mud house. He wears a
crude backpack and carries a large battle ax. They start
"across the clearing. Suddenly, out of nowhere, Boma is"
"standing before them. He says nothing, but scratches his"
head and then circles around Captain Valor.
JUSTIN
We are leaving. We must go.
Stand away!
The huge Jawa kneels and bows down in front of the young Dai.
Valor looks down and smiles.
JUSTIN
Rise my friend. We will meet
again.
Valor walks toward the jungle and Boma scurries ahead of him
and bows down once more.
A-2
What does he want?
Valor shakes his head and rubs his several days growth of
beard. He leans down toward Boma.
JUSTIN
Stand up so we can talk properly.
Boma jabbers in a questioning fashion.
JUSTIN
I am grateful to you and your
"people, but I must go. I wish"
you understood me. I would
make things so much easier.
Go! Go!
"Valor turns away, and begins to walk toward the jungle again."
"Boma gets to his feet and runs after the Dai, following a few"
paces behind. Valor notices the Jawa following them and
shakes his head.
141. FOREST OF THE GARGANTUANS - TRAPPER SIGHT - YAVIN
The bodies of the killed trappers are covered with rat-sized
insects. A lazer explosion erupts in the middle of the slimy
creatures and they scatter into the underbush. Han and the
general turn over one of the dead trappers.
HAN
They ran into something.
SKYWALKER
It's strange they left their
dead. Something...
The constant cacophony of jungle creatures suddenly stops.
The two warriors scan the jungle for possible danger. Han
draws his lazerpistol. The cacophony starts again as the
general ignites his lazersword.
HAN
Two or three moving this way
from the east.
He listens more closely for a few moments.
HAN (Cont.)
It's A-2.
Captain Valor and A-2 break out of the dark foliage into the
clearing. He waves to Han and the general. A-2 waddles a
few paces behind. Boma sees the humans and stops at the
edge of the jungle. He watches as Captain Valor and the
general carry on an animated conversation. Han sees the
Jawa lurking in the shadows.
HAN
You were followed.
JUSTIN
He wouldn't stay. He's the one I
saved.
Han calls out to Boma in the Jawa's own language and the
huge lumbering creature approaches the group. Han and the
"Jawa talk for a few moments, then embrace as if they were"
old friends. Captain Valor is surprised.
HAN (to Valor)
"This is Boma, son of Auzituck,"
Prince of the Sawas - a very
powerful tribe. It seems they've
made you a god.
The general smiles. Captain Valor is embarrassed.
142. VINE JUNGLE RIDGE - YAVIN
Captain Valor joins the general on a ridge overlooking the
royal outpost of Mavassi. All that can be seen of the
fortress is a lone guard standing on a small pedastal jutting
out above the dense jungle.
SKYWALKER
Their trail leads directly to the
outpost. Patrols are probably
out looking for us by now.
JUSTIN
Finding her in there isn't going
to be easy.
SKYWALKER
Getting in there is going to be
"impossible, but we could sure"
use those starships.
Captain Valor spots something moving in the jungle. He scans
the area with his electrobinoculars.
JUSTIN
Something's going on down there.
Han!
"Han moves up next to Valor, followed closely by Boma."
JUSTIN
Your eyes are better than mine.
What do you make of that?
HAN
"They look like Jawas, hundreds"
of them.
"Han turns and speaks to Boma, gesturing toward the movement"
far below in the jungle.
HAN
Apparently it's a siege. They've
been harassing the outpost for
almost two years.
SKYWALKER
Have they ever tried to take the
fortress?
Han relays this to Boma.
HAN
He says they've made several
"assaults, but they are no match"
for the weapons.
SKYWALKER
It's only a class three fortress.
Maybe they just need a little
help.
"Captain Valor grins, and Han says something to Boma, who"
becomes excited and screeches loudly.
143. INTERIOR - TREE HOUSE - YAVIN
The incoming signal alarm on the anthropologist's radio
"system wails through the calm of the tree house. Oeta,"
"dragging an eight-legged, furry rodent, rushes up to the"
old radio and flips the receiver.
OETA
I'm reading yah. Go ahead.
SKYWALKER
"Oeta, how are you getting along?"
OETA
"Great! I caught a thumper, a"
really big one. Its name is
Amber.
"He yanks on the leash, and the furry beast lets out a"
strained yelp.
SKYWALKER
"Good, Oeta. How's your brother?"
Are you taking good care of him?
OETA
"Oh, sure. He's out collecting"
"""abas"" with Huu and Beru. I'm"
in charge here. Did you find
Zara?
SKYWALKER
Not yet. We'll be away for a
while. You mind Tho until we
return. May the force of others
be with you.
OETA
All right. Take care.
C-3 enters the room carrying a plate of steaming food. Oeta
turns the radio off and puts the receiver away. A crashing
sound and voices are heard in the clearing below.
C-3
Come and eat your dinner.
OETA
They're back! They're back! Come Amber.
The furry rodent jumps up onto its eight stubby legs and
"rushes over to the door, but stops short and begins to growl."
Oeta stops behind the creature.
OETA
"What is it, Amber?"
"Oeta peeks out the window, and sees a patrol of six royal"
stormtroopers climbing out of an airtank. He ducks back
and tugs Amber away from the door.
OETA
"Quiet, Amber. Come here. Come on."
C-3
What's wrong?
OETA
Troopers. We must hide. Stay quiet.
Oeta and the robot scramble for a trap door near a large
shelf. The troops begin to climb the ladder to the tree
"house. The trap door is heavy, and the robot and the little"
boy struggle to get it open. The troops break in the door
just as C-3 closes the trap door. The troopers are led by
"a rough looking sergeant. They poke around, tearing every-"
"thing apart. Oeta struggles to keep Amber quiet. Suddenly,"
he realizes something.
OETA
The food!
The sergeant takes the bowl of food from the table and
studies it. He then takes a small chrome ball from his
pocket and tosses it into the air. Antennae shoot from
its surface as it floats around the room. Eventually it
hovers over the trap door. A sinister grin sweeps across
the sergeant's face as he moves over to the trap door and
puts the chrome ball back into his pocket.
"C-2 puts his arm around Oeta, who is desperately clutching"
the struggling thumper. All the movement above them stops
and Oeta looks to the robot.
C-3 (quietly)
They're still up there. Stay
still.
"The silence continues, then suddenly the trap door swings"
open with a loud bang. Amber breaks away from Oeta and
attacks the sergeant. One of the other troopers cuts the
thumper in half with his lazersword. The sergeant pulls
Oeta out of his hiding place. Oeta stares at the dead
thumper.
SERGEANT
"Well, well! Here's one of them,"
anyway. Send seekers in all
directions. Find the others!
144. VINE JUNGLE RIDGE - YAVIN
The general sits at the head of the large stone table
pushing small markers around. Han explains what the general
is doing to ten or fifteen Jawa chiefs gathered around the
"table. Occasionally, Boma puts in a word of further explana-"
tion or answers a question. Captain Valor sits back silently
watching the Jawa warriors and listens to the general's plan.
SKYWALKER
... then they pull back to here.
That's where the trap will be set.
No-one must advance. An assault
on the perimeter is useless. Our
only hope is to use their weapons
against them.
The general pauses while Han and Boma translate.
SKYWALKER
"Once we acquire those tanks, our"
prime object must be to secure the
starship. No-one must escape.
145. IMPERIAL OUTPOST - VINE JUNGLE - YAVIN
Three officers run along a row of giant airtanks to a perimeter
"bunker. There, two stormtroopers are watching the jungle."
"When the officers arrive, the troopers let them look through"
the powerful mounted electrobinoculars. One of the troopers
points out several areas in the dense jungle.
146. INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM - ROYAL OUTPOST - YAVIN
A trooper sitting at an elaborate control panel turns to an
officer watching a monitor system.
TROOPER
A large concentration of trestuals
at point E-2.
OFFICER
Alert squads one through six.
147. VINE JUNGLES - OUTPOST PERIMETER - YAVIN
The general stands in a clearing surrounded by many armed
"Jawas carrying large shiny shields. Han moves back and forth,"
barking orders to the assembled creatures.
SKYWALKER (to Han)
We're ready. Give them the signal.
"Han motions to a young Jawa, who takes off, running through"
the jungle.
148. ROYAL OUTPOST - VINE JUNGLE - YAVIN
Three large airtanks slowly move toward the outpost perimeter.
"The tank pilots sit on the hatch rims of the ponderous weapons,"
studying the movements of the Jawas. The tank personnel talk
to one another on an intercom system.
TANK PILOT
"There is a large concentration,"
red two by X-S. Let's break
them up.
The pilots slip into the tanks and close the hatches. The
tanks open up with a barrage of lazerbolts which create a
"wall of explosions. The Jawas retreat, and the tanks follow."
The tank crews track the fleeing creatures with various
"electronic scopes, and laugh at the fleeing creatures."
149. VINE JUNGLE - OUTPOST PERIMETER - YAVIN
"The general stands on a limb of a jungle tree, watching the"
advancing tanks. Captain Valor is on another branch a few
feet away.
SKYWALKER
They've grown sloppy fighting
Jawas. The intrafazer systems
aren't on. They're in for a
little surprise.
"Captain Valor flashes a signal mirror, which is received by"
a Jawa near the tanks. The Jawas are in pairs and they hold
"heavy stone wedges attached to woven vines, which, in turn,"
are fastened high in the trees. When the tanks pass directly
"under the Jawas, they let loose with the heavy stone"
"pendulums. The wedges fly through the air, neatly clipping"
off the antenna groupings protruding from the tops of the
airtanks.
150. INTERIOR - AIRTANK - VINE JUNGLE - YAVIN
Several of the lights and monitors go dark on the main control
panel. The pilot flips several switches in a panic.
PILOT
All high phasing units are out.
We've lost all contact.
SERGEANT
Send out a ground signal!
"Suddenly, all of the monitors go white, and static fills the"
crowded tank interior. An alarm signal sounds.
SERGEANT
What is it?!!!
PILOT
"All signals, sensers, everything,"
are coming right back to us. Some
kind of deflection screen. It's a
total blackout.
SERGEANT
Get out there and see if you can
see anything.
The pilot pushes a button and the main hatch slowly slides
away.
151. VINE JUNGLE - OUTPOST PERIMETER - YAVIN
The pilot pops out of the hatch and sees two rows of Jawa
warriors holding reflective shields. They form a circle
that totally encompasses the massive air tank. Han shouts
"a signal to a group of Jawas in another tree, and they cut"
loose a bent limb which is attached to a noose around the
tank's hatch. The noose instantly tightens around the pilot
and he is plucked from the tank and suspended fifty feet in
"the air. In an equally swift move, Captain Valor drops a"
small gas grenade into the open hatch. It explodes and
engulfs the tank in a gray mist.
"The Jawas let out a joyful yell, and charge the tank. Han"
"yells at them to stop, but several make it to the conquered"
craft before the gas cloud dissipates and they are felled by
the fumes. Valor waits until after the smoke clears and
then jumps on the back of the immobile tank.
Several signal mirrors flash their messages to Han and the
general.
HAN
That makes four captured.
SKYWALKER
Have them camouflaged. I'm
going with Captain Valor.
152. INTERIOR - AIRTANK - VINE JUNGLE - YAVIN
Jawas are removing the tank crew as Valor checks out the power
controls. The general slides through the main hatch.
SKYWALKER
Any damage?
JUSTIN
She's fine. We're ready to
move.
SKYWALKER
Then let's go.
"The general yells for the Jawas to clear the tanks, and they"
scramble out of the hatch.
153. VINE JUNGLE - OUTPOST PERIMETER - YAVIN
"The tank starts up with a loud roar, startling many Jawas"
resting on the mighty vehicle. Boma yells at the warriors
"and they fall a few feet behind the tank, their shields"
forming a shiny protective wall.
154. ROYAL OUTPOST - VINE JUNGLE - YAVIN
Several officers stand on a parked airtank trying to get a
better view of the operation. A light landspeeder pulls up
next to the group and a general gets out. The officers snap
to attention.
GENERAL
Can you see anything?
OFFICER
"No, sir, but they've stopped"
firing.
AIDE
Communications still can't reach
"them, sir."
GENERAL
Does anyone know what's going on?
OFFICER
I'm sure they've got them on the
"run, sir."
A lazerbolt flashes out of the jungle and destroys a guard
tower about a quarter of a mile from where the men are
"standing. Seconds later, the airtank on which they are"
standing explodes into a million pieces. Out of the jungle
"rumbles the captured airtank, driven by Captain Valor and"
followed by a column of Jawa warriors.
"Alarms sound, troops rush from the low block-houses, and a"
"battle rages inside the outpost. Jawas with spears, axes,"
and arrows mange to hold their own against the lazer weapons
of the stormtroopers. Explosions erupt everywhere as the
Jawas begin to use captured lazerrifles. They are much
fiercer fighters than the soft royal troops.
155. INTERIOR - AIRTANK - OUTPOST - YAVIN
Captain Valor works the controls of the airtank as the general
watches the monitors and works the lazerguns.
SKYWALKER
Swing left. They're trying to cut us
off.
156. STARSHIP RUNWAY - ROYAL OUTPOST - YAVIN
Captain Valor maneuvers the airtank in front of a line of
ten starships cutting off a platoon of stormtroopers. The
troops open fire on the tank but are cut down by a group of
Jawas who have moved in behind them. Han and A-2 run up to
the tank as Valor and the general climb out of the hatch.
HAN
We've taken the main control center.
All power units have been shut
down. They're helpless.
JUSTIN
Have they found Zara?
HAN
They've taken her back to Townowi.
The ship left nor more than ten
hours ago.
SKYWALKER (to Han)
Set up a perimeter around these
starships. Use as many men as
you need.
157. STAFF OFFICE - ROYAL OUTPOST - YAVIN
Captain Valor and the general sit at a large table in the
deserted office of the Royal Chief of Staff. The room is
in a state of disarray; papers are scattered everywhere.
"A-2 stands on a chair, projecting an image of the ""death"
"star"" fortress orbiting Townowi, on the table top."
A-2
... and are connected to the
central system by a series of
crossing networks similar to
section TB4 or F687.
The projection switches to a close-up view of the transformer.
"The general studies it carefully, then leans back in his chair."
A-2 turns off the projector.
SKYWALKER
"I'm not going to stop you, but I"
think it's a reckless move. Even
"if you could get in, you'd never"
be able to get out. Just be patient.
We now have enough ships to attack
in force.
JUSTIN
But no pilots.
Han and Boma enter the office.
HAN
Still no contact with Huu Tho
or the kids. I'm afraid some-
thing's happened.
SKYWALKER
Have Boma send two of his best
warriors out there to get them.
Han relates this to Boma. The general turns back to
"Captain Valor, who watches Boma leave the room."
JUSTIN (mocking)
They're fierce warriors but you'll
never teach them to fly.
The general gives him a stern look.
SKYWALKER
They'll fly and Townowi will be
free.
JUSTIN
May the force of others be with
you.
The general embraces the young Dai.
SKYWALKER
Bring her back safely.
158. OUTPOST RUNWAY - STARSHIP - YAVIN
"Captain Valor, dressed as an royal skyraider, and A-2 climb"
aboard one of the giant four-man starships. A crowd of
Jawas lead by Boma give a rousing cheer for the departing
Dai. Valor breaks into a smile and waves to the joyous
warriors. The general watches the proceedings from a bunker
turret. He is lost in thought.
159. SPACE FORTRESS - TOWNOWI
Three royal space transports dock inside the huge artificial
moon. The smaller convoy starships circle the larger craft
until the three ships are safely inside the vast fortress.
160. CONFERENCE ROOM - INTERIOR SPACE FORTRESS - TOWNOWI
"General Vader of the Royal Space Fleet, hurries down a hall-"
"way, followed by a group of officers. They enter the large"
conference room where Zara is held under heavy guard. She
"appears well, but saddened. Vader approaches her and bows"
before her.
VADER
I pray you have been treated honorably?
"I am your servant, Darth Vader. It"
won't be long before we will be able to
return you to your people. (to an aide)
Are the chambers ready?
AIDE
"They are working on it, sir."
"Zara stares defiantly at him. She starts to speak, but a"
powerful electric shock engulfs her body and she whines
in extreme pain.
VADER
"Just relax, and everything will be fine."
(to guards) Take her to section twenty-
five.
Zara is forcibly taken from the room.
VADER (to officer)
What time do the doctors from Granicus
arrive?
OFFICER
"Sixty-five hours, sir."
VADER
Put all security stations on alert
until they arrive.
The officer salutes smartly and exits.
161. ROYAL OUTPOST - VINE JUNGLE - YAVIN
A huge air tank rumbles along the approach to the royal
"outpost. The pilot sits on the main hatch of the tank,"
talking to his crew by headphones.
PILOT
Any contact yet?. It appears
deserted. I don't like it.
The tank enters the outpost perimeter and smoking rubble
from the recent battle comes into view The pilot becomes
alarmed.
PILOT
There has been an attack!
Reverse direction.
The tank comes to a grinding halt but before it can start
up again it is surrounded by the Jawa army. From out of
no-where a Jawa is on the back of the airtank and has the
pilot in a powerful armlock.
"A Jawa chieftan rushes from a bunker, followed by an excited"
jabbering warrior. They reach the captured airtank just as
the last crewman is hauled out and little Oeta pokes his
head out of the hatch. He is frightened. His younger
"brother Puck follows him out of the tank. Below them, the"
Jawas bully the captured crewmen.
PUCK
What will they do to us?
OETA
I don't know but it don't look
good.
"C-3 pulls himself out of the airtank, followed by Han Tho"
and his wife. The Jawa chieftan climbs on board and starts
to jabber at the group The Jawa carries on for some time
gesturing wildly and continually pointing at the sky. The
"two boys are too scared to say anything. Finally, the Jawa"
kneels before them. C-3 politely returns a short bow.
OETA
I don't get it.
"The Jawa rises and again gestures skyward, just then a starship"
"wildly buzzes the field, upside-down. All the Jawas run for"
"cover. The chief Jawa points to the crafts, and jabbers"
incessantly.
162. INTERIOR - ROYAL STARSHIP - SKY OVER YAVIN
Boma sits at the controls of a four-man starship. His face
is a twisted combination of complete panic and an awesome
religious experience. The general sitting next to him
"calmly switches a few buttons on the control panel, as Han"
watches from the seat directly behind the Jawa.
SKYWALKER
You'll get the hang of it.
Han also gives the Jawa a few words of encouragement.
SKYWALKER
"Now, let's see if we can get into"
"orbit. Push this, then ease her up."
Boma follows the instructions but pulls back on the lever
too fast and the ship being to vibrate and bounce violently.
Boma thinks it's funny and begins to laugh hysterically. Han
becomes nervous and upset.
SKYWALKER
Not so fast. Back off! Back off!
"Han yells at the Jawa, who can't respond because he is"
laughing so hard. The general pulls back on the lever. Han
shakes his head and gives the general a worried look.
SKYWALKER
Don't worry. Ignorance is on
their side.
Han is beginning to look a little sick. He gets up and
rushes to the back of the ship.
163. ROYAL SPACE FORTRESS - DOCKING AREA - TOWNOWI
The canopy on the starship pops open and A-2 and the young
"Dai disguised as a starraider, climb out onto the docking"
platform. An officer and two groundcrew approach him and
salute. Captain Valor hands him his papers.
JUSTIN
I'm here to check the vent ports in
the rim tracks.
OFFICER
Your ship is from Yavin. We've
lost all contact with them. What's
going on out there?
JUSTIN
There is a fierce invasion just east of
Bull Pup station. It's really a mess
out there.
The officer smiles and the ground crew starts to check out
"the starship. Valor heads for the main docking exit, followed"
by A-2. He remembers something as he passes the control
station and calls out to the officer.
JUSTIN
Do you mind if I use your com-link?
OFFICER
No. Go ahead.
Valor walks into the small control area and pretends to talk
on an intercom system.
JUSTIN (to A-2)
Find the highest security area.
A-2 punches his claw arm into a computer socket and the brain
"comes to life, feeding information to the little robot."
Captain Valor watches the officer as he directs the crewmen
in the securing of the starship. A-2 removes his arm from
the computer and the duo leave the control station.
A-2
Station 325 is the highest security
area on board. It's a detention area.
They disappear into a chamber lock hallway.
164. ELEVATOR TUBE - SPACE FORTRESS - TOWNOWI
"Valor, trying to look inconspicuous, waits for a horizontal"
"elevator. Troops and fortress personnel come and go, but"
no-one seems to pay any attention to the pair. Finally a
small car arrives and Valor follows A-2 into the podlike
vehicle and it takes off through a vacuum tunnel.
165. DETENTION AREA - SPACE FORTRESS - TOWNOWI
Valor and A-2 enter a security station. Guards and electronic
cutters are everywhere. An officer approaches Valor and checks
his papers.
OFFICER
The B-23 can't enter this station.
JUSTIN
But I need him.
OFFICER
Sorry. No mechanical personnel.
It's restricted.
Valor watches helplessly as A-2 is led into a waiting area.
OFFICER
You may proceed but you'll have
to be escorted.
A trooper joins Valor and leads him through a series of
hallways. Valor carefully surveys the area as he follows
the guard.
TROOPER
Mathusians just beat the PDRs again.
They should be in another league. Do
you follow the ecometrics?
The guard turns to discover that Captain Valor has dis-
"appeared. He is stunned, then manages to pull out a small"
ring radio.
TROOPER
Code six - alert.
166. STARSHIP RUNWAY - ROYAL OUTPOST - YAVIN
"Six Jawas sit before Han and the general, listening to Han"
explain something about space fighting. Tho approaches the
general.
THO
We've made contact with the under-
ground on Townowi. Things are
tighter. They can only get one
man out. Datos is on his way.
SKYWALKER
We should be ready by the time he
arrives.
Han turns to the general.
HAN
They're ready to go up.
The general makes a short statement to the Jawas in their
own language. They let out a loud cheer and run for the row
of starships.
167. STARSHIP - SPACE - YAVIN
The general sits next to Boma as he leads two other Jawa-
piloted starships in a tight formation. They head for a
small cluster of asteroids orbiting near the planet's surface.
The general quietly gives Boma some reassuring instructions.
"Han leads a second formation of three ships, following Boma's"
group. The two formations of starships make an attack run on
the asteroids. The general watches as Boma lines up and fires
at an asteroid blowing it into a million pieces. The general
smiles and slaps Boma on the back. The Jawas excitedly
chatter among themselves over the intercom system.
168. DETENTION AREA HALLWAY - SPACE FORTRESS - TOWNOWI
A patrol of ten men marches through one of the long hallways
in the detention area. They stop at an intersection. The
officer in charge reports on the intercom.
OFFICER
Ben Five to Boma. All clear.
"The troops relax; some stand in groups, others wander a"
"distance away, poking into the various small alleyways"
running off the main hallway. One trooper notices a small
reflected light in one of the narrow corridors and carefully
moves down the dark passageway to check it out. Out of no-
"where, a fist knocks the trooper unconscious and drags him"
into a small alcove.
The officer finishes his report on the intercom and yells
for the troops to fall-in. Men scurry in all directions
"and out of a narrow corridor emerges Captain Valor, dressed"
in the uniform of a royal startrooper. He joins the platoon
and they march away.
169. GENERAL'S QUARTERS - SPACE FORTRESS - TOWNOWI
General Vader and several officers watch the progress of the
search on TV monitors. The general speaks into an intercom.
VADER
Have them clear the area. Bring
in the seekers.
On the monitors the troops are assembled in the main entry-
way and several small chrome balls are thrown into the hall-
way. Small antennae pop from the chrome surface and the
"small balls float down the hallways. Dodona, once a proud"
"legionnaire, enters wearing the uniform of a stormtrooper."
He snaps to attention before the general and hands him a
report. Vader gives Dodona a sly grin.
DODONA
Contact has been lost with the ship
carrying the doctors from Granicus.
The princess' treatment will have to
be delayed.
VADER
We've just trapped your old friend
Captain Valor. Watch us accomplish
what you found to be impossible.
Dodona is humiliated but stays at attention. Vader gets an
emergency call on the intercom.
VADER
Yes. Yes. Put it on the view screen.
One of the TV monitors switches to an image of the unconscious
trooper Captain Valor stripped.
VADER
Get me the Captain of the Guard.
170 DETENTION AREA - MAIN ENTRY - SPACE FORTRESS - TOWNOWI
"Three squads of troops, including Captain Valor, stand at"
"attention in the main entrance to the detention area, while"
the Captain of the Guard gets new orders over his head-
"phones. Valor studies the situation carefully, looking for"
a way out of his predicament. The Captain of the Guard calls
up the platoon sergeants and gives them a series of orders.
They return to their squads and begin to inspect the troops.
Valor begins to get worried.
The sergeant works his way down the line until he gets to
"the trooper next to Valor. He sees no chance of escape, but"
"surprise. Suddenly, he bolts from the ranks and races down"
the hallway.
CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD
Squad leaders!
Ten troopers break out of the ranks and take up the chase.
"Captain Valor runs down a corridor and rounds a corner,"
reaching a dead end. The troops round the corner and
confront the trapped Dai. The sound of igniting lazer-
"swords fills the hallway. Valor takes a defensive stance,"
his huge lazersword buzzing loudly. The troops attack.
They fight with skill and bravery but are eventually all
cut down by the invincible Dai warrior.
Captain Valor breaks away from the troops and runs down a
"long hallway. A safety door slides shut, closing off his"
escape. He turns around in time to see another door seal
off the opposite end of the hallway. Before he can make
"any attempt to pry open the door, gas fills the sealed"
corridor. Valor collapses in a heap on the floor.
171. GENERAL'S QUARTERS - SPACE FORTRESS - TOWNOWI
Vader laughs as he watches the unconscious Valor on the TV
monitors. All of the other officers in the room are laughing
"and joking, except Dodona, who remains grimly at attention."
VADER (to Dodona)
Take him to the special section.
"Dodona salutes, and exits the offices. Vader laughs again."
172. STARSHIP RUNWAY - ROYAL OUTPOST - TOWNOWI
Nine gleaming starships sit in a row along the edge of the
vast jungle runway. Bizarre and colorful Jawa designs have
been painted across the large deflector fins of the space-
craft. Some designs transform the ships into huge and
"grotesque animals, while others create unique mosaic patterns."
The four-man Jawa crews stand proudly at attention in front
"of their ships. The general, along with Han and the under-"
"ground leader, Datos, review the assembled Jawas. In one of"
"the Jawa crews, a pilot is picking fleas off the back of his"
tail gunner. When the general passes he snaps to attention.
There is a gleam in the general's eye as he shows off his
strike force to the crusty old underground leader. When
"they've inspected the last starship, Datos turns to the"
general.
DATOS
I'm speechless. It's amazing. A
most impressive display. For the
"first time since the take-over, I"
feel real hope.
SKYWALKER
Will your people be ready?
DATOS
Our forces have already started
sabotaging their com-link set
ups. A refugee camp on Mananyo
has been conducting raids on
shipping from Granicus. That's
how we intercepted those doctors.
SKYWALKER (to Han)
Get them in the ships. We're on
our way. (to Datos) Send the
code signal.
173. DETENTION CELL - SPACE FORTRESS - TOWNOWI
"General Vader and Dodona watch as a medic revives Valor,"
who has been strapped to an upright slab protected by
cutter-rays.
MEDIC
He's coming round.
The medic backs away and throws the switch which activates
the cutters. A blue glow surrounds Valor as he wakes up
and sees Vader and Dodona.
VADER
For all the myths and the trouble
you don't seem like much.
He laughs and leaves Dodona alone in the room with the young
Dai. Dodona appears sad and frustrated at the capture of the
noble warrior. They stare at one another for a few moments.
DODONA
You were insane to come here. The
security on this...this thing is
impossible. Why? For her? I can't
believe your loyalty is that strong.
"You're a great warrior, but you're a"
greater fool. This is a place for
"androids - no codes, no honor. Our"
ways are useless here. Why couldn't
you have stayed away?
He storms out of the cell. Captain Valor struggles to free
himself.
174. SLUM DWELLING - GORDON SPACEPORT - TOWNOWI
"The young partisan, Occo, listens to a small transmitter in"
a secret closet behind the main room in a slum dwelling. He
jumps up and runs into the main room where Quist and
several other men are sitting around a table covered with
maps and plans.
OCCO
It's Datos. We've got the go
ahead.
The men cheer and starts hugging and slapping each other on
the back. Finally they settle down.
QUIST
Go to your organizations. (to Occo)
What's the code time?
OCCO
Zero three thirty.
QUIST
May the force of others be with you.
The men solemnly shake hands and leave the room.
175. GOVERNOR'S OFFICE - SPACE FORTRESS - TOWNOWI
Captain Valor stands on a small platform before Governor
Horus and the High Consul. His hands are held behind his
back by electric bonds.
HORUS
... and I'm sure the King will
enjoy your execution. I only
regret I won't be there myself.
This should end the Dai Nogas
myth once and for all. Take
him to Granicus.
Dodona steps forward with a squad of stormtroopers and
escorts the prisoner away. Vader and the governor seem
very pleased with themselves. Dodona looks back in disgust.
176. CONTROL CENTER - SPACE FORTRESS - TOWNOWI
"In the large central control room, two officers sit above"
a row of monitors and giant readouts.
FIRST OFFICER
Look! That whole sector just
went dead. We're losing contact
with the surface. Use the IF
link and find out what's going
on.
177. DOCKING AREA - SPACE FORTRESS - TOWNOWI
Dodona halts the squad guarding Captain Valor on an
observation deck overlooking a starship docking port.
Dodona reports to the officer in charge.
DODONA
Where is the ship?
OFFICER
It's on its way in. It will just
be a few minutes.
Dodona returns to his squad and watches the large starship
"slowly move into the docking area. He glances at Valor,"
"who stands defiant, ready to meet his fate."
Dodona continues to study Valor. The young Dai returns his
gaze. Slowly the spacecraft locks onto the docking port
with a loud jolt. The troops snap to attention but Dodona
grabs two lazerswords and in one swift move switches off
Valor's bonds and tosses him one of the lazerswords. Valor
"assumes a defensive stance, as the troops realize what has"
happened and draw their swords.
DODONA
This way!
The two warriors fight their way through a side exit. The
"door slides closed behind them, and Dodona throws the lock,"
trapping the troops on the observation platform. They race
down the hallway and stop at an intersection.
DODONA
This way! We can get a starship
and be out of here before they've
discovered...
JUSTIN
I'm not leaving without the princess.
DODONA
It's impossible; there are traps
everywhere. You're mad!
Valor just grins and runs down the passageway leading to the
detention area. Dodona rushes and catches up. An alarm
signal wails through the hallways.
178. JAWA STARSHIPS - SPACE
The general leads three squads of starships toward the glowing
planet of Townowi.
SKYWALKER
There she is. Activate your deflection
shields.
179. DETENTION AREA - SPACE FORTRESS - TOWNOWI
Dodona talks with the Captain of the Guard. He gestures wildly
like something important had happened. Four troops run into
the central detention area leading the bound princess. The
"captain salutes Dodona and the legionnaire, followed by the"
"four troops and Zara, leave the main area."
180. DETENTION HALLWAY - SPACE FORTRESS - TOWNOWI
Valor appears boldly at the end of the hallway facing Dodona
and the troops.
DODONA
Get him!
"The troops rush for Valor, swords drawn. They are no match"
"for the skilled Dai. He makes short work of them, as Dodona"
frees the princess. The trio then run into another hallway.
The princess embraces Valor.
DODONA
We have only a few seconds before they
find us. All of these hallways are
sealable.
Valor spots a small garbage chute on the corridor wall. He
goes and looks into it.
JUSTIN
Is this pressurized?
DODONA
They're power sealed. We'll have to
"find another way, or some way to shut"
the power off.
They search the smooth-walled room for another exit.
182. GOVERNOR'S QUARTERS - SPACE FORTRESS - TOWNOWI
Governor Horus watches General Vader as he supervises the
hunt for Valor and Dodona. They watch troops move through
the detention area via TV monitors. Seekers buzz through
the hallways. The general gets a report from an officer
on another monitor.
OFFICER
We've lost contact with the surface.
There is a good probability of an
uprising. Even the IF links are out.
VADER
Use a substandard relay and put all
units on alert.
The officer disappears from the monitor and is replaced with
the Captain of the Guard.
CAPTAIN
All sections D through P-12 are clear.
We have reason to suspect they escaped
through the disposal system. We are
checking. (he is interrupted by an
excited trooper who tells him something)
We've found them in Receptacle B-29.
You should...
A red light flashes on one of the other monitors.
VADER
Hold on.
A controller appears on the second monitor.
CONTROLLER
"Starships approaching, three squads"
"of royal design, but no clearance."
GENERAL
Full alert. Battle stations...
The general turns back to the Captain of the Guards.
CAPTAIN
You should have them on your
screen.
Alarms sound throughout the fortress. Lights flash a
warning.
182. GARBAGE RECEPTACLE - SPACE FORTRESS - TOWNOWI
A floodlight switches on revealing Dodona and Valor
attempting to cut open the door. The princess stands up
and stares into the floodlight. Vader's voice comes over
an intercom.
VADER
I'm afraid I have no more time to
deal with you. A senseless and
futile attack by your friends has
forced me to take a rather un-
pleasant course of action. Your
execution will have to be expedited.
The intercom clicks off and a loud rumbling begins to shake
"the room. With a loud shriek, the princess points to the"
far wall; it has started to move toward the trio. The
situation looks desperate.
183. SPACE - JAWA STARSHIPS - TOWNOWI
"Lazerfire from the space fortress creates a wall of death,"
which the three squadron of Jawa starships miraculously
emerge through undamaged. The general barks orders to the
Jawa craft and Boma and his squadron break off and start an
attack dive. Lazerfire from Boma's brightly colored ship
hits one of the prime power terminals on the fortress sur-
"face. It explodes, creating weird electric arcs as it goes."
Han and the general also concentrate fire on the distinctive
black power terminals. Two more are destroyed in an arcing
"spectacle. A chain reaction is set off, creating a series of"
explosions leaping across the surface of the fortress from
power terminal to power terminal.
184. GARBAGE RECEPTACLE - SPACE FORTRESS - TOWNOWI
The shock of the explosion can be felt over the rumbling of
the trash masher. The wall has moved within a few yards of
"squashing Dodona, Valor and the princess. They are still"
"frantically trying to somehow stop the relentless wall, to"
"no avail. The lights blink off, then on again and the"
moving wall rumbles to a halt. Zara breathes a sigh of
relief.
VALOR
They must have knocked the power
out.
Dodona runs over to the door and kicks it open. They rush
out of the would-be death trap.
185. SPACE - JAWA STARSHIPS - TOWNOWI
One of the Jawa starships is caught in a crossfire and dis-
appears in a cloud of smoke. Another ship for some unknown
"reason dives headlong into the surface of the fortress,"
creating a huge explosion.
186. MAIN HALLWAY - SPACE FORTRESS - TOWNOWI
"Captain Valor, Dodona and the princess are thrown to a hallway"
floor by the explosion. They get up and start down the hall-
way again. A voice calls out from a connecting corridor.
A-2
Hey! Over there.
The trio turn and see little A-2 standing at the other end of
the corridor. He waves his claw arm at them and wobbles over
to them.
A-2
The power core has exceeded the
normal stress quotient by point
eight. The magnetic fusion pods
have evaporated. There appears
to be an immediate danger.
DODONA
There is a lifepod station at the
other end of this section. Hurry.
"The group followed by A-2, make a dash for the lifepod,"
but are knocked to the ground by another explosion which
"rocks the hallway. A hole is ripped in one wall, sucking"
debris into space. Everyone holds on to wall fixtures for
dear life.
187. GOVERNOR'S QUARTERS - SPACE FORTRESS - TOWNOWI
"Aides and officers rush through the office, as Vader tries"
"to keep things under control. Governor Horus remains calm,"
watching the progress of the battle. Vader turns to the
governor.
VADER
They've pinpointed every terminal.
It's impossible. What are they?
Where did they come from? An
electromagnetic transfer has started.
There's no stopping it.
GOVERNOR
Continue the fight.
VADER
We've already lost control of the
planet. We must abandon ship while
there is still time. Conditions are
much worse than...
GOVERNOR
Continue the fight. This fortress
is invincible. I will not give up.
A giant explosion sweeps through the office.
188. SPACE - JAWA STARSHIPS
The tiny starships race the chain reaction explosions across
the surface of the fortress. Lazerfire is everywhere. One
of the starships skimming across the surface lags behind and
is caught in an explosion and disappears.
SKYWALKER
Han! Get everyone out of here.
The whole thing's going to go.
Return to Gordon. Get them out.
"Han relays the order to the Jawas, and then starships pull"
away from the crippled fortress.
189. MAIN HALLWAY - SPACE FORTRESS - TOWNOWI
The group has made their way past the hole in the wall and
are climbing into the lifepods. Captain Valor helps the
"princess into one, while Dodona and A-2 get into the other."
Warning sirens scream throughout the hallways. Three troops
"run toward the lifepods, firing lazerpistols. dodona returns"
"the fire, stopping the oncoming troops. Hatches are closed"
and the lifepods eject into space.
190. LIFEPODS - SPACE - TOWNOWI ORBIT
The two lifepods drift toward the calm of the planet's
surface. Captain Valor and the princess embrace and he
kisses her tenderly. They watch the ominous fortress grow
"smaller and smaller as they drift away. Suddenly, a great"
flash replaces the fortress and rubble streaks past the
"lifepods. Several giant explosions follow, then there is"
only a smoke cloud where the mighty fortress once orbited
Townowi.
191. THRONE ROOM - PALACE OF LITE - TOWNOWI
"Queen Zara, in all her grandeur, sits on the magnificent"
throne of Townowi. Captain Valor and the general stand to
her right. Several old advisors stand to her left. Han
"presents Boma and a delegation of Jawas with a treaty,"
"gifts, and a medal of honor. They bow and exit. Han moves"
to one side of the crowded court. Dodona stands next to
"him. They watch as the two robots, A-2 and C-3 approach"
the Queen and bow.
ZARA
Your service to Townowi is greatly
appreciated. You are designated
"class A-4, and will serve Justin"
"Valor, the new Lord Protector of"
Townowi. Rise!
The robots rise and exit through the long entrance hall to
the throne. The Queen turns and smiles at Valor and the
general. The general and Valor salute their new Queen.
